# Optimal Transport and Machine Learning

Over the last decade, optimal transport (OT) has evolved from a prize-winning research area in pure mathematics to a recurring theme bursting across many areas of machine learning (ML). Advancements in OT theory, computation, and statistics have fueled breakthroughs in a wide range of applications, from single-cell genomics to generative modeling and the optimization of over-parametrized neural nets , among many others. The OTML workshop series has been instrumental in shaping this influential research thread. The OTML workshop aims to provide a unique platform to federate, disseminate, and advance current knowledge in this rapidly growing field.

# Topics
We invite researcher in optimal transport and machine learning to submit their latest works to our workshop.

Topics include but are not limited to:
- Optimal Transport Theory
    - OT with generalized choices of cost functions
    - Study of partial differential equations and Wasserstein gradient flows (theory + applications)
    - Limits of regularization schemes
- Generalizations of Optimal Transport
    - Unbalanced formulation (OT between measures of different mass)
    - Gromov-Wasserstein formulation (OT with rigid transformations)
    - Multi-marginal OT
    - Martingale OT (financial applications, etc)
- Computational and Statistical Optimal Transport
    - Estimation of Monge maps, couplings, etc.
    - Finite-sample convergence guarantees
    - Limit distribution theory
    - Study of complexity of OT algorithms
- Optimal Transport for Machine Learning and Applications
    - OT costs as a loss (e.g. GANs, minimization of Wasserstein distance between empirical and population measures)
    - OT to define data transformations (domain adaptation, clustering)
    - High-dimensional applications such as Natural Language Processing, computational biology, vision tasks, etc.
    - Low-dimensional applications such as graphics, shapes, imaging, etc.
