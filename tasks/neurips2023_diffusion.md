# Workshop on Diffusion Models

## Overview

Over the past three years, diffusion models have established themselves as a new generative modelling paradigm. Their empirical successes have broadened the applications of generative modelling to image, video, audio, 3D synthesis and science applications. As diffusion models become more and more popular and are applied to extremely diverse problems, it also becomes harder to track the key contributions in the field. This workshop aims to keep track of the recent advances and set guidelines for future research. By bringing together practice, methodology and theory actors we aim at identifying unexplored areas and pushing the frontier of diffusion model research.

## Topics
We invite researchers from machine learning and related fields to submit their latest work on theory and applications of diffusion models to the workshop. We encourage submissions related (but not limited) to the following topics:

- Theory and methodology of diffusion models
    - Stochastic differential equations for generative models
    - Probabilistic inference, variational inference
    - Novel training methodology or architectures
    - Improved/accelerated diffusion model inference
    - Limitations and drawbacks of diffusion models
    - Theoretical properties of diffusion models
- Applications of diffusion models
    - Generation of images, video, audio, molecules, motion, etc.
    - Conditional generation, guidance, controllability, and personalization
    - 3D applications of diffusion models
    - Solving inverse problems
    - Image/video editing
