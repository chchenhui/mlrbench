# Will Synthetic Data Finally Solve the Data Access Problem?
Accessing large scale and high quality data has been shown to be one of the most important factors to the performance of machine learning models. Recent works show that large (language) models can greatly benefit from training with massive data from diverse (domain specific) sources and aligning with user intention. However, the use of certain data sources can trigger privacy, fairness, copyright, and safety concerns. The impressive performance of generative artificial intelligence popularized the usage of synthetic data, and many recent works suggest (guided) synthesization can be useful for both general purpose and domain specific applications.

Will synthetic data ultimately solve the data access problem for machine learning? This workshop seeks to address this question by highlighting the limitations and opportunities of synthetic data. It aims to bring together researchers working on algorithms and applications of synthetic data, general data access for machine learning, privacy-preserving methods such as federated learning and differential privacy, and large model training experts to discuss lessons learned and chart important future directions.


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Risks and limitations of synthetic data.
- New algorithms for synthetic data generation.
- New applications of using synthetic data (e.g. in healthcare, finance, gaming and simulation, education, scientific research, or - autonomous systems).
- Synthetic data for model training and evaluation.
- Synthetic data for improving specific model capabilities (e.g., reasoning, math, coding).
- Synthetic data to address privacy, fairness, safety and other data concerns.
- Evaluation of synthetic data quality and models trained on synthetic data.
- Conditional and unconditional synthetic data generation.
- Fine-grained control of synthetic data generation.
- Data access with federated learning and privacy-preserving methods.
- New paradigm of accessing data for machine learning.
- Mixing synthetic and natural data.
