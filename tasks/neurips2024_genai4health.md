## GenAI for Health: Potential, Trust and Policy Compliance

Generative AI (GenAI) emerged as a strong tool that can revolutionize healthcare and medicine. Yet the public trust in using GenAI for health is not well established due to its potential vulnerabilities and insufficient compliance with health policies. The workshop aims to gather machine learning researchers and healthcare/medicine experts from both academia and industry to explore the transformative potential of GenAI for health. We will delve into the trustworthiness risks and mitigation of cutting-edge GenAI technologies applicable in health applications, such as Large Language Models, and multi-modality large models. By fostering multidisciplinary communication with experts in government policies, this workshop seeks to advance the integration of GenAI in healthcare, ensuring safe, effective, ethical, and policy-compliant deployment to enhance patient outcomes and clinical research.


## Topics

We invite paper submissions that have not been published, falling in but not limited to the following topics.
- Topic 1: GenAI use cases
    - For example, surveys of GenAI in healthcare, methodologies of using GenAI for data synthesis, simulation (e.g., digital twins), preliminary study, improving diagnosis accuracy, treatment assistance, and digital therapies.

- Topic 2: Trustworthiness and risks
    - For example, novel benchmarks of GenAI safety in specific or general health use cases, potential misuse, safeguarding techniques, reliability, and ethical disparities.

- Topic 3: Policy and compliance
    - For example, reviews of the latest policies in the association of AI and health, evaluation of the compliance of current GenAI applications, and pipelines to coordinate policymakers, GenAI developers, and security experts.

Papers will be submitted in three tracks: demonstration papers for the GenAI health applications, research papers for the policy-compliant GenAI trustworthiness in health or methodology of using GenAI for health, and position papers discussing policies and solutions for technical compliance. We encourage authors to involve multidisciplinary experts, especially the health community (e.g., stakeholders) and policymakers in writing the papers, which ensures the developed methods can address emerging stakeholders' and policymakers' concerns.
