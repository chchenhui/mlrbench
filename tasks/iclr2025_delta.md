# Workshop on Deep Generative Model in Machine Learning: Theory, Principle and Efficacy

We are excited to invite submissions to the ICLR 2025 Workshop on Deep Generative Models: Theory, Principle, and Efficacy. This workshop aims to explore challenges and opportunities in advancing the theoretical foundations and practical applications of deep generative models (DGMs).

Theory topics include, but are not limited to:
- Expressivity of deep generative models: investigate the expressivity of deep generative models and their performance variations across different datasets
- Optimization and generalization of deep generative models
- Solving stochastic processes for deep generative models
- Sampling methods
- Model Stability and Convergence Analysis in DGMs
- Implicit Bias and Regularization in Generative Models
- Robustness and Generalization Boundaries of Generative Models
- Latent Space Geometry and Manifold Learning

Application areas include, but are not limited to:
- Improved sampling schemes
- Adversarial Robustness and Defense Mechanisms
- Scalability and Efficiency in High-Dimensional Generative Modeling
- Multimodal Generative Modeling Algorithms
- Structured Data Modeling
- Generative models for scientific discovery (AI4Science)
