## Pluralistic Alignment Workshop

Welcome to the Pluralistic Alignment Workshop! Aligning AI with human preferences and values is increasingly important. Yet, today’s AI alignment methods have been shown to be insufficient for capturing the vast space of complex – and often conflicting – real-world values. Our workshop will discuss how to integrate diverse perspectives, values, and expertise into pluralistic AI alignment. We aim to explore new methods for multi-objective alignment by drawing inspiration from governance and consensus-building practices to address conflicting values in pluralistic AI alignment. Discussion will include technical approaches for dataset collection, algorithms development, and the design of human-AI interaction workflows that reflect pluralistic values among diverse populations. By gathering experts from various fields, this workshop seeks to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and push the boundaries of the understanding, development and practice of pluralistic AI alignment.


# Topics

Our workshop aims to bring together researchers with diverse scientific backgrounds, including (but not limited to) machine learning, human-computer interaction, philosophy, and policy studies. More broadly, our workshop lies at the intersection of computer and social sciences. We welcome all interested researchers to discuss the aspects of pluralistic AI, from its definition to the technical pipeline to broad deployment and social acceptance.

We invite submissions that discuss the technical, philosophical, and societal aspects of pluralistic AI. We provide a non-exhaustive list of topics we hope to cover below. We also broadly welcome any submissions which are broadly relevant to pluralistic alignment.

**Philosophy:**
- Definitions and frameworks for Pluralistic Alignment
- Ethical considerations in aligning AI with diverse human values
  
**Machine learning:**
- Methods for pluralistic ML training and learning algorithms
- Methods for handling annotation disagreements
- Evaluation metrics and datasets suitable for pluralistic AI
  
**Human-computer interaction:**
- Designing human-AI interaction that reflects diverse user experiences and values
- Integrating existing surveys on human values into AI design
- Navigating privacy challenges in pluralistic AI systems
  
**Social sciences:**
- Methods for achieving consensus and different forms of aggregation
- Assessment and measurement of the social impact of pluralistic AI
- Dealing with pluralistic AI representing values that are offensive to some cultural groups
  
**Policy studies:**
- Policy and laws for the deployment of pluralistic AI
- Democratic processes for incorporating diverse values into AI systems on a broad scale
  
**Applications:**
- Case studies in areas such as hate speech mitigation and public health
