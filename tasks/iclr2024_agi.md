# How Far Are We From AGI

## Topics

This workshop aims to become a melting pot for ideas, discussions, and debates regarding our proximity to AGI. We invite submissions on a range of topics including, but not limited to:

1. **Frontiers of AGI research:** Examples include AI agents, embodied AI, retrieval-based and tool- augmented LLMs, knowledge-enhanced AI, and multi-agent AI.

2. **Classic AGI Attempts as Inspiration:** Delving into historical methods such as expert systems, symbolic AI, Type I and Type II reasoning for insights that can guide LLM research further.

3. **Interdisciplinary Insights for AGI:** Drawing parallels from fields like psychology, sociology, and neuroscience to inspire and inform the development of LLMs towards AGI.

4. **Fundamental Limitations of LLMs:** Analyzing the intrinsic capabilities or lack thereof in LLMs that might impede their progression to AGI. This includes discussions on reasoning, planning, and more.

5. **Practical Limitations of LLMs and Foundation models:** Addressing external challenges like system constraints, computational costs, data acquisition barriers, and privacy concerns.

6. **Safety, Ethics, and Regulation in AGI Development:** Exploring the complexity of moral, safety, and regulatory concerns that will shape AGI’s evolution.

7. **AGI’s Economic and Societal Impacts:** Probing the potential changes AGI might initiate into our societies, economies, and daily lives.
