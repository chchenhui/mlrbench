## Structured Probabilistic Inference & Generative Modeling

Probabilistic inference addresses the problem of amortization, sampling, and integration of complex quantities from graphical models, while generative modeling captures the underlying probability distributions of a dataset. Despite promising results, probabilistic methods face challenges when applied to highly structured data. We aim to bring experts from diverse backgrounds together, from both academia and industry, to discuss the applications and challenges of probabilistic methods, emphasizing challenges in encoding domain knowledge in these settings. We hope to provide a platform that fosters collaboration and discussion in the field of probabilistic methods.

## Scope

Relevant topics to this workshop include but are not limited to:

- Inference and generating methods for graphs, time series, text, video, and other structured modalities.
- Unsupervised representation learning of high dimensional structured data.
- Scaling and accelerating inference and generative models on structured data.
- Uncertainty quantification in AI systems.
- Applications and practical implementations of existing methods to areas in science.
- Empirical analysis comparing different architectures for a given data modality and application.
