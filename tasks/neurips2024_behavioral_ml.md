## Workshop on Behavioral Machine Learning

Across many application areas, machine learning systems rely on human data. Yet these systems often leave unmodelled the psychological processes that generate human data.

Fortunately, there's a field full of insights about human behavior: the behavioral sciences. However, many of these  insights are qualitative. Integrating them into machine learning systems requires converting them into computational models and designing machine learning systems to incorporate them.

The goal of this workshop is to explore the incorporation of insights from the behavioral sciences into AI models/systems. We hope to bring together computer scientists across many subfields — e.g. AI, robotics, HCI — with behavioral scientists to drive progress in this interdisciplinary area.
