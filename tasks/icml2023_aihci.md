# Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction

## Workshop Overview

Artificial intelligence (AI) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) share common roots: early work on conversational agents has laid the foundation for both fields. Despite sharing a common history, economic and political influences have driven these fields to remain separate in subsequent decades. The recent rise of data-centric methods in machine learning has propelled few-shot emergent AI capabilities, resulting in a raft of practical tools. In particular, modern AI techniques now power new ways for machines and humans to interact. Recently, a wave of HCI tasks has been proposed to the machine learning community, which direct AI research by contributing new datasets and benchmarks, and challenging existing modeling techniques, learning methodologies, and evaluation protocols. Machine learning techniques have been developed for a variety of tasks, including user-interface understanding, UI generation, accessibility, and reinforcement learning from human feedback. This workshop offers a forum for researchers to discuss these new research directions, identify important challenges, showcase new computational and scientific ideas that can be applied, share datasets/tools that are already available, or propose those that should be further developed.
