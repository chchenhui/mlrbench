# Robot Learning Workshop: Towards Robots with Human-Level Abilities

## About This Workshop
The year 2024 has seen an explosion of interest in humanoid robots. However, recent systems for drone racing, playing table tennis, and others clearly demonstrate that the humanoid form-factor isn’t a requirement for human-level performance. In the 7th Robot Learning workshop, to be held at ICLR 2025, we will look beyond the humanoid embodiment and ask: how far are we from robots with human-level abilities? What do we need to improve about embodied learning, decision-making, perception, and data collection to train generally physically capable robots to robustly perform a wide range of activities such as cooking or tidying up a house – activities that people do without much thinking?

We believe many of the weaknesses of the current robotic systems to be a reflection of the shortcomings of general AI methods and models. As such, we seek diverse perspectives on the workshop theme from robotics-focused and robotics-orthogonal parts of the ICLR community alike, scientific contributions from academia and industry, as well as participants from a variety of backgrounds and career stages.

We welcome submissions of original research papers as well as systems papers focusing on algorithmic innovations, theoretical advancements, system design, or practical applications relevant to the workshop theme.

Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to:
- Novel ML algorithms and model architectures for robot control: techniques integrating large multi-modal models, sim-to-real bridging, safe policy optimization, and data efficiency.
- Human-robot interaction and collaboration: socially aware motion planning, adaptive interfaces, and trust-building strategies for seamless teamwork. Hardware innovations and system integration: advanced sensing and actuation, high-degree-of-freedom controllers, energy-efficient designs, and cohesive robotics architectures.
- Simulation, benchmarking, and evaluation methodologies: realistic simulation environments, standardized task suites, robust metrics, and cross-domain validation protocols.
- Applications in unstructured and dynamic environments: household assistance, mobile manipulation, industrial automation, healthcare, disaster response, and other real-world domains.
