## Overview of Scene Representations for Autonomous Driving

This workshop aims to promote the real-world impact of ML research toward self-driving technology. While ML-based components of modular stacks have been a huge success, there remains progress to be made in the development of integration strategies and intermediate representations. We invite contributions discussing the following topics, in order to empower the next generation of autonomous vehicles:

- Representation learning for perception, prediction, planning, simulation, etc
- Approaches that account for interactions between traditional sub-components (e.g., joint perception and prediction, end-to-end driving)
- ML / statistical learning approaches to facilitate safety / interpretability / generalization
- Driving environments / datasets for benchmarking ML algorithms
- New perspectives on the future of autonomous driving
