# Workshop on Generalization in Planning

Humans are good at solving sequential decision-making problems, generalizing from a few examples, and learning skills that can be transferred to solve unseen problems. However, these problems remain long-standing open problems in AI.

This workshop will feature a synthesis of the best ideas on the topic from multiple highly active research communities. On the one hand, recent advances in deep-reinforcement learning have led to data-driven methods that provide strong short-horizon reasoning and planning, with open problems regarding sample efficiency, generalizability and transferability. On the other hand, advances and open questions in the AI planning community have been complementary, featuring robust analytical methods that provide sample-efficient generalizability and transferability for long-horizon sequential decision making, with open problems in short-horizon control and in the design and modeling of representations.

# Topics

The workshop will focus on research related to all aspects of learning, generalization, and transfer in sequential decision-making (SDM). This topic features technical problems that are of interest not only in multiple sub-fields of AI research (including reinforcement learning, automated planning, and learning for knowledge representation) but also in other fields of research, including formal methods and program synthesis. We will welcome submissions that address formal as well as empirical issues on topics such as:
- Formulations of generalized SDM problems.
- Representations, learning, and synthesis for generalized plans and policies.
- Learning for transfer and generalization in reinforcement learning.
- Learning and representing hierarchical policies and behaviors for SDM.
- Learning and synthesis of generalizable solutions for SDM problem classes.
- Learning paradigms, representations, and algorithms for transferring learned knowledge and solutions to new SDM problems.
- Learning and representing generalized Q/V functions and heuristics for plan and policy generalization.
- Learning high-level models and hierarchical solutions for generalizable SDM.
- Neuro-symbolic approaches for generalization and transfer in SDM.
- Few-shot learning and transfer for SDM.
- Meta-learning for generalizable policies.
- Learning for program synthesis.
- Learning domain control knowledge and partial policies.
- Generalization and transfer in robot planning problems.
- Representation of solution structures that enable generalization and transfer.
