# Robot Learning Workshop: Pretraining, Fine-Tuning, and Generalization with Large Scale Models

Large pre-trained models have accelerated progress in many domains of machine learning research, such as text generation, chatbots, and image generation. In the 6th iteration of the Robot Learning workshop at NeurIPS, we will create a space for researchers from diverse backgrounds to gather and discuss the opportunities, challenges, and risks associated with large models in robotics research. Robotics is one of the most exciting and diverse applications for machine learning. It is both a hard challenge and a fruitful source of problems for machine learning approaches and our workshop is a space for members of both communities to meet.

The topic is chosen purposefully to be broad in terms of modalities and data sources as we are interested in different ideas of how pre-training can be applied to robotics. The combination of pre-trained models for vision and language for example has recently led to rapid progress in robotic tasks such as high-level planning or scene understanding. While pre-training on large-scale datasets usually comes with the benefit of generalization capabilities, it poses novel challenges that need to be addressed. The pre-training dataset can come from a wide range of sources with different perception systems in a range of environments. Therefore fine-tuning is an essential step in order to use large-scale models for a specific task. How to efficiently perform this fine-tuning, typically with limited hardware, while also ensuring a safe deployment remains an open research question.

# Topics

The workshop aims to highlight both favorable and critical voices with regard to the emerging trend of large scale pre-training to encourage a lively debate and meaningful exchange among the presenters and attendees. 

Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

- the role of pre-training from offline data, self-play, imitation, or other source in robotics pipelines;
- generalization of pre-trained models to novel tasks and environments;
- combination of different data modalities for training large models in robotics;
- finetuning, or other modular adaptation mechanisms for deploying pre-trained models on a new environment;
- combining large models and multimodal training for robotics,
- safe real-world deployment of pre-trained models;
- opportunities and challenges arising from embodiments and data collection;
- datasets and method proposals for collecting, curating, and sharing pre-training data for robotics
