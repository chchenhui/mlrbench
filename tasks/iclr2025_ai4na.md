# Workshop on AI for Nucleic Acids

AI4NA aims to popularize AI applications for nucleic acids and introduce nucleic acid research challenges to the broader AI community. This workshop aims to spotlight nucleic acids as the next frontier for AI research. By bringing together experts from machine learning and biology, we will explore how AI can address key challenges in nucleic acids research, such as RNA tertiary structure prediction, understanding nucleic acid interactions, and designing bespoke RNA/DNA molecules with therapeutic potential.

The topics focus on applications of AI and novel AI methods for RNA and DNA research including, but not limited to:

- Nucleic Acid Structure and Function: RNA secondary and tertiary structure prediction, RNA function analysis, NA interactions
- Foundation and Generative Models for Nucleic Acids: (Multimodal) NA foundation models, Generative models for NAs
- Nucleic Acids in Therapeutics: NA drug design and discovery, NA modification, NA mutations
- Genomic Data Analysis: Genome reconstruction, Gene expression, Calling genetic variants, Pairwise and multiple NA sequence alignment, Single-cell transcriptomics and genomics
