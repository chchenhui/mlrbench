# New Frontiers of AI for Drug Discovery and Development

Drug discovery and development is costly, time-consuming, and highly uncertain on the outcomes. Since its emergence, AI has been envisioned to nearly every phase of drug discovery and development to accelerate time-to-market of effective medicines and to improve the quality of life while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions for patients. In this workshop, we aim to foster discussion about the challenges, discoveries, and opportunities of AI for drug discovery and development.
