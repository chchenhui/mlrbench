# Deep Generative Models for Health Workshop

## Overview
Deep generative models have recently gained unprecedented attention following recent advancements in text-to-image generation, diffusion models and large language models. Additionally, early well-establishedÂ  approaches, such as variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and normalizing flows, are widely applied for learning interpretable representations, as well as integrating multiple modalities or prior information from domain knowledge. These advancements hold the premise of unlocking significant potential in the health sector.

Generative AI emerges as a compelling solution in addressing the challenges posed by the scarcity of medical datasets due to complex data acquisition processes and privacy regulations, the demand for accountable and interpretable methodologies, and the need to integrate multiple and diverse modalities. Despite the recently witnessed methodological advances, generative approaches are limited in their current real-world medical applications. This is arguably due to several open challenges that include designing objective validation procedures, as well as finding reliable metrics for learnt representations to assess interpretability and semantic content.

In this workshop, we provide a unique venue for the most recent trends in research on deep generative models, focusing on exploring their potential for health applications. We also provide the optimal setting to discuss the open problems that prevent these methods from having a profound positive impact in clinical settings. This workshop will be the ideal venue to attract a diverse pool of researchers aiming to integrate generative models in health scenarios.

We encourage submissions that leverage the recent methodological advancements in generative models to address critical medical challenges across all data-types, paving the way for their practical integration into the healthcare system.

## Topics
We solicit original paper submissions advancing research that leverages methodological advancements in generative models to address health applications across all data-types. Under this premise, we encourage submissions touching topics such as (but not limited to):

- Synthetic data generation
- Combining multiple data modalities
- Super-resolution
- Scarcity/missingness of medical datasets
- Explainable and interpretable generative methods
- Robustness and validation procedures
- Advances in generative models tailored towards health applications, including but not limited to
    - text-to-image generation, 
    - diffusion models, 
    - large language models, 
    - variational autoencoders,
    - normalizing flows,
    - generative adversarial networks,
    
Finally, we encourage work that is actionable in clinical practice, especially targeting application areas that tackle minority data groups and, thus, have their own specific, often under-explored, challenges. Such areas include, but are not limited to, pediatrics, critical care (ICU), rare diseases like Alzheimer, HIV, and fertility.
