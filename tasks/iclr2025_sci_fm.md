# Workshop on Open Science for Foundation Models

## About the Workshop
Foundation models (FMs) have transformed AI research but lack scientific transparency. The SCI-FM workshop aims to address this by fostering open science, reproducibility, and the sharing of open-source models and datasets. We invite contributions that explore key aspects of FMs, such as dataset curation, evaluation methodologies, and innovative training strategies. Join us in advancing the accessibility and transparency of foundation models for the global research community.

## Scope

We invite papers on topics including, but not limited to:

- Open Datasets: Acquisition, curation, and synthesis of pretraining, instruction, and preference datasets through manual or algorithmic methods. Open access to instruction and preference datasets for alignment research.
- Open Foundation Models: Pretraining strategies including data scaling, model architecture, multi-modal, and multi-task pretraining. Learning algorithms such as meta-learning, model fusion, model merging, and continual learning designed for open, scalable models. Inference algorithms like decoding, reasoning, search, and planning, tailored for foundation models.
- Open Training Protocols: Training dynamics research on scaling laws, interpretability, complexity analysis, emergent capabilities, and phenomena like grokking. Alignment techniques including prompt tuning, prefix tuning, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning with human/AI feedback.
- Open Evaluation: Benchmark development and the creation of transparent evaluation protocols and metrics, including the open sharing of benchmark datasets and evaluation results across different foundation models.
- Open Compute Efficiency Techniques: Focus on model distillation, compression, quantization, and optimizing attention or memory mechanisms for improved compute efficiency in open foundation models.
- Open Multi-Modal Foundation Models: Expanding to modalities like vision, audio, and multi-modal foundation models, with extra emphasis on underexplored areas such as chemistry, medicine, and education.
- Open Interactive and Agent Systems: Open development of conversational AI, interactive learning models, multi-agent systems, and integration with external tools and APIs.
- Open Replication of Proprietary Systems: Efforts to replicate and openly share foundation models and systems that were previously proprietary, ensuring transparency and reproducibility for broader research and development.
