# Information-Theoretic Principles in Cognitive Systems

The InfoCog workshop is an interdisciplinary venue for exploring new avenues for progress toward an integrative computational theory of human and artificial cognition, by leveraging information-theoretic principles and formulations. To this end, we aim to bring together researchers from machine learning, cognitive science, neuroscience, linguistics, economics, and other fields, who are interested in information-theoretic approaches to cognitive systems, as well as researchers from information theory who focus on advanced methods for computation and estimation of information theoretic measures. 

# Topics

We invite submissions that present original work related to information theory and cognitive systems. We aim to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines (e.g., machine learning, cognitive science, neuroscience, linguistics, economics) who are interested in information-theoretic approaches to human and artificial cognition. This year will feature a special emphasis on connections with researchers focused on the computation/estimation of information-theoretic quantities, with the aim of tightening the collaboration across the machine learning, cognitive science, and information theory communities. We particularly encourage submissions of interdisciplinary work.

Examples of specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Novel information-theoretic approaches to cognitive functions (e.g., perception, decision making, language, social reasoning,etc.)
- Method and approaches for the validation of information-theoretic formalism in human and artificial cognition
- Novel methods and approaches for the computation and/or estimation of information theoretic quantities and their application tohuman and artificial cognition
- Challenges and limitations of the use of information theory in studying cognitive systems
- Application of information theory to training human-aligned artificial agents, i.e., agents that can better communicate and cooperate with humans
