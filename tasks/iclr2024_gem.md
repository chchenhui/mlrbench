# Generative and Experimental Perspectives for Biomolecular Design

## About

Biomolecular design, through artificial engineering of proteins, molecules, and nucleic acids, holds immense promise in addressing pressing medical, industrial, and environmental challenges. While generative machine learning has shown significant potential in this area, a palpable disconnect exists with experimental biology: many ML research efforts prioritize static benchmark performance, potentially sidelining impactful real-world applications. 

The Generative and Experimental perspectives in bioMolecular design (GEM) workshop seeks to bridge this gap by bringing computationalists and experimentalists together. Together, we will explore the strengths and challenges of generative ML in biology, experimental integration of generative ML, and pinpoint biological problems ready for ML. 

GEM is collaborating with Nature Biotechnology to allow exceptional submissions to be considered for fast-tracking in their journal. GEM features two tracks of submission: an in-silico generative machine learning track, and an experimental track for any papers that have wet lab results. 

Our lineup features renowned scientists as panelists and emerging leaders as speakers, encapsulating a spectrum from high-throughput experimentation and computational biology to generative ML. With a diverse organizing team and backed by industry sponsors, we dedicate the workshop to pushing the boundaries of ML's role in biology.
