# ExplainableAI (XAI) in Action: Past, Present, and Future Applications

As AI models continue to advance in complexity and sophistication, understanding how they work and make decisions is becoming increasingly challenging. This challenge has prompted a surge of research into developing methods and tools that can enhance the transparency and explainability of these models. Nowadays, there are many such methods available, to the point that their specific applications have become somewhat unclear.

This workshop will specifically explore the diverse applications of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods in various areas. The areas will include, but not limited to XAI in Healthcare, Natural Science, Auditing, Fairness, Natural Language Processing and Law. By examining the use of XAI in these fields, the workshop will provide attendees with insights into the latest trends and challenges within the different domains.

The workshop discussions aim to delve into the latest advancements in applied XAI and devise ways to further progress the field. The objective is to foster an open and productive dialogue that enhances our understanding of the potential opportunities and constraints of XAI and its impact across different domains. The purpose of this discourse is to identify strategies that can extend the frontiers of applied XAI and make notable progress in this rapidly evolving area.
