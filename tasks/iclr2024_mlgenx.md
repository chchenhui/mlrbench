# Machine Learning for Genomics Explorations

## Overview

Our limited understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying diseases remains a critical bottleneck in drug discovery. As a result, we often lack insights into why patients develop specific conditions, leading to the failure of many drug candidates in clinical trials. Recent advancements in genomics platforms and the emergence of diverse omics datasets have sparked increasing interest in this field. The primary objective of this workshop is to bridge the gap between machine learning and genomics, emphasizing target identification and emerging drug modalities such as gene and cell therapies and RNA-based drugs. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, we aim to advance the integration of these disciplines and accelerate innovation in drug discovery.

## Subject Areas

We consider a broad range of subject areas including but not limited to the following topics. All contributions introducing new ML methods to existing problems and those that highlighting and explaining open problems are welcome. We also encourage submissions related to application of molecular biology, including but not limited to, single-cell RNA analysis, bulk RNA studies, proteomics, and microscopy imaging of cells and/or tissues.
