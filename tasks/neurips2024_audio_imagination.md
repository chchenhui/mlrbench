## Audio Imagination: AI-Driven Speech, Music, and Sound Generation

Generative AI has been at the forefront of AI research in recent times, with numerous studies showcasing remarkable and surprising generation capabilities across various modalities such as text, image, and audio. Audio Imagination Workshop at NeurIPS 2024 aims to bring the latest advancements in generative AI focusing on audio generation. Audio generation presents unique challenges due to the nature of the audio signal, its perception by humans, and its relationship with other modalities like text and visuals. Modern generative methods have brought about new opportunities for solving well-studied audio generation problems, such as text-to-speech synthesis, while also leading to explorations of exciting new problems. The workshop seeks to bring together researchers working on different audio generation problems and facilitate concentrated discussions on the topic. It will feature engaging invited talks, high-quality papers presented through oral and poster sessions, and a demo session to showcase the current state of audio generation methods. 


## Topics

We invite researchers to submit papers focusing on, but not limited to, the following topics related to audio generation:

- Textual prompts and natural language inputs based generation and editing of audio, such as text-to-speech (i.e., speech synthesis), text-to-music and text-to-sound
- Audio/Speech in LLMs/Multimodal LLMs
- Connection of audio generation with text generation, including similarities and differences.
- Video to Audio/Speech/Music Generation
- Multimodal generation of audio - going beyond unimodal inputs (text/video/audio) to audio â€” using multiple modalities for generating audio
- Data for audio/speech/music generative AI
- Methods for Evaluation of Generated Audio
- Generative methods for and its impact on established speech tasks such as speech enhancement, source separation, voice conversion, speech to speech translation, to mention a few
- Generation of spatial audio and experiences driven by spatial audio.
- Generation of audio for virtual or augmented reality (VR/AR)
- Synchronized Generation of audio along with visuals
- Impact of generative audio on media and content creation technologies
- Interpretability in generative AI for audio/speech/music.
- Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music.
- Novel applications of audio/speech/music generation
