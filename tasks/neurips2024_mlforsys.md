## Machine Learning for Systems 

Machine Learning for Systems is an interdisciplinary workshop that brings together researchers in computer systems and machine learning, specifically focusing on the novel application of machine learning techniques towards computer systems problems.

## Topics
We invite submission of up to 4-page extended abstracts in the broad area of using machine learning in the design and management of computer systems . We are especially interested in submissions that move beyond using machine learning to replace numerical heuristics.

This year, we additionally look for

- Using LLMs for systems challenges, such as program synthesis for hardware and other specialized domains.
- Applying ML to systems issues that emerge from large-scale training and serving, such as compiler partitioning schemes for training LLMs across thousands of GPU or TPU devices.
- Applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization. Examples include energy-aware job scheduling, dynamic power management based on workload and carbon predictions, and ML-driven carbon footprint assessment for cloud datacenters.
