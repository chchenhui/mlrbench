# Workshop on Theory of Mind in Communicating Agents

## Motivation

Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to reason about the minds of other agents. The main theme of our workshop is the computational modeling of ToM, with a special focus on the role of natural language in such modeling. Specifically, ToM 2025 pays attention to cognitive foundations and theories of ToM, the acquisition and relationship between language and ToM, leveraging ToM to improve and explain NLP and ML models, and using ToM for positive social impact. This workshop intends to promote the community of researchers that are interested in improving the ability of intelligent agents to reason about others' mental states. Our proposed program provides a space to discuss pathways for understanding and applying ToM in psycholinguistics, pragmatics, human value alignment, social good, model explainability, and many other areas of NLP. 

## Topics

**Potential topics include:**
- Leveraging ToM for Machine Learning Applications (e.g., NLP, Robotics, CV)
- Cognitive Science Perspectives of ToM
- ToM for HCI / Human-AI collaboration
- Surveys or replication of existing work
- Social Impacts of ToM
