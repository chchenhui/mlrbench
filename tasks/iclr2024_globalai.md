# Global AI Cultures

## Description

Building globally-inclusive artificial intelligence systems that encodes and respects cultural sensibilities as well as performs well for users across cultural contexts, is an important goal as we deploy AI products globally. However existing AI evaluation, design and deployment practices are not oriented towards a diversity of global cultures and we do not recognize fully the cultural values that AI amplifies. If this relationship between AI and global cultures is not examined we inadvertently could be universalizing western centered AI and create unforeseen impacts on global cultural production, values and consumption. This workshop aims to develop a shared vocabulary for contending with the cultural impacts of AI , the cultural gaps of AI and the cultural values of AI by putting into conversation AI researchers considering the technical nuances of generative AI with scholars from the humanities and social sciences that have long thought about the social and cultural impacts of new technologies.

## Themes

This workshop will encourage field building on deepening our understanding for how we can build and deploy globally inclusive AI and how we can responsibly encode cultural knowledge into our technologies. It will include discussions about:

- **Conceptual and Theoretical Foundations for Cultural Inclusion in AI**: What does global inclusion mean in the context of AI and what are the possibilities and challenges of building culturally inclusive AI models?
- **Scalable Cultural Representation Evaluations**: How do we build evaluation and development pipelines that can test cross-cultural performance via cultural metrics such as representation, quality, impact, and inclusion at scale?
- **Culturally-Rich Training Datasets**: What are the features of a culturally representative training dataset and what processes and conditions are needed in order to create or curate such training data?
- **Methods to study cultural values of generativeAI**: How can we recognize and account for the different cultural values that are embedded in our AI pipelines? How do we bring our cultures of development in sync with our cultures of deployment?
- **User Interactions in Support of Cultural Inclusion**: Are there creative strategies that can reparatively promote the inclusion of subjugated cultural values through UI, deployment, or public education/advocacy?
- **Cultural impacts of Generative AI**: How can we understand immediate and longer-term impacts of these technologies on the culture industries? How does AI support or challenge support existing dynamics in the culture industries? Are there existing norms or principles in non-AI systems of content creation and distribution?
