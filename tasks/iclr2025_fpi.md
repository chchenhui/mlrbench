# Frontiers in Probabilistic Inference: Learning meets Sampling

## About the Workshop
The Frontiers in Probabilistic Inference: Sampling meets Learning (FPI) workshop at ICLR 2025 focuses on modern approaches to probabilistic inference to address the challenging and under-explored area of sampling from an unnormalized distribution. Sampling spans a wide range of difficult and timely problems from molecular dynamics simulation, and Bayesian posterior inference/inverse problems to sampling from generative models weighted by target density (e.g. finetuning, inference-time alignment). We hope to provide an inclusive and collaborative environment to discuss emerging ML methods for learning samplers and their applications to real-world problems. We aim to facilitate discussions around identifying some key challenges of learning-based approaches, compared to classical sampling approaches, along with techniques to overcome them.

We will center workshop discussions around the following topics/questions:

- Sampling methods and their connections to optimal transport and optimal control.

- Classical sampling approaches and how learning accelerates them.

- Connections between sampling methods and physics.

- Understanding sampling from theoretical perspectives. 

- Applications of sampling to natural sciences, Bayesian inference, LLM fine-tuning, and more.


We invite all submissions of original work across three different tracks:

- Research Papers

- Challenges and Reflections

- Benchmarks and Datasets


### Research Papers

Goals: The goal of the Research Papers track is to highlight all original research work in the field of sampling. Some examples of the research topics include, but aren't limited to:

- Bayesian posterior inference/inverse problem.

- Amortized sampling from Botlzmann densities.

- Sampling from generative models (diffusion model and LLMs) weighted by target density: i.e. fine-tuning, inference-time alignment, etc.

- Applications: e.g. molecular dynamics simulations, statistical physics, etc.

### Challenges and Reflections

Goals: The goal of the Challenges and Reflections track is to explore setbacks, unexpected outcomes, and the valuable lessons learned from methods that didnâ€™t achieve their intended goals. Some examples of the research topics include, but aren't limited to:

- Ideas and methods that didn't make a paper but discussing the methodology and the results can provide valuable insights for future researchers. 

- Challenges and open problems in the field. We encourage the researchers to discuss 1. Why the current state-of-the-art research fails to address those challenges and 2. What are some of the directions that the researchers believe the community must focus on and pursue to overcome those challenges. 

### Benchmarks and Datasets

Goals: The goal of the Benchmarks and Datasets track is to encourage submissions of papers which highlight a dataset, tools or benchmarks that can be disseminated to the community during the workshop.
