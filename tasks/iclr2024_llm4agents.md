# Large Language Model (LLM) Agents

## About

This Workshop delves into the significance of agents driven by large language models (LLMs), a topic that has recently sparked intense discussions. 
Building on the current huge progress on LLMs, we'll focus on autonomous agents that perform intricate tasks in both real and simulated environments guided by natural language instructions. What sets these agents apart is their sophisticated use of language prompts, not just as a means of communication but also as a medium for reasoning—a characteristic once thought unique to humans.

## Topics
We will explore a range of topics in this workshop, including, but not limited to, the following areas:

- **Memory Mechanisms and Linguistic Representation**:
This session will analyze the similarities between LLMs and human memory and will discuss the mechanisms of storage and formation of the linguistic representation in LLMs.
- **Tool Augmentation and Grounding (interaction with environment)**:
Addressing the enhancement of LLMs through tool augmentation, this session will also include a discourse on grounding – linking natural language concepts to particular contexts.
- **Reasoning, Planning, and Risks**:
This session will discuss the intertwined processes of reasoning and planning in language agents and highlight the potential hazards associated with language agents' ability to autonomously operate in the real world.
- **Multi-modality and Integration in Language Agents**:
This session will explore how language agents can integrate multiple modalities such as vision, sound, and touch to enhance their understanding and interaction with the environment.
- **Conceptual Framework for Language Agents**:
This session will delve into a potential framework for language agents by drawing from both classic and contemporary AI research and related fields such as neuroscience, cognitive science, and linguistics.
