# Navigating and Addressing Data Problems for Foundation Models

## Overview

Foundation Models (FMs, e.g., GPT-3/4, LLaMA, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.) have demonstrated unprecedented performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. Following the rapid evolution, as researchers strive to keep up with the understanding of the capabilities and limitations of FMs as well as their implications, attention is now shifting to the emerging notion of data-centric AI.

Curation of training data is crucially important for the performance and reliability of FMs and a wealth of recent works demonstrate that data-perspective research sheds light on a promising direction toward critical issues such as safety, alignment, efficiency, security, privacy, interpretability, etc. 

To move forward, this workshop aims to discuss and explore a better understanding of the new paradigm for research on data problems for foundation models.
