# Workshop on Long-Context Foundation Models

## Overview

Many challenging tasks for foundation models require synthesizing information over thousands to millions of individual pieces of data, which may take many forms, including images, text, audio, genomes, etc. Our workshop aims to convene researchers to address challenges in long-context foundation models, fostering discussions, developments, deployments, evaluation, and understanding of long-context foundation models across various AI disciplines. 

## Topics

The topics of this workshop include (but not limited to):

- New modeling, training, and data strategies.
- Efficiency techniques for (long-context) foundation models.
- Evaluation and understanding of long-context models.
- Retrieval-augmented foundation models.
- Interdisciplinary applications of LCFMs.
