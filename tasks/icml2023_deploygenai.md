## Challenges of Deploying Generative AI

Generative modeling has recently gained massive attention given high-profile successes in natural language processing and computer vision. However, there remain major challenges in deploying generative models for real-world impact in domains like healthcare and biology. This is a challenging agenda that requires collaboration across multiple research fields and industry stakeholders. This workshop aims to advance such interdisciplinary conversations around challenges in deploying generative models â€“ the lessons learned by deploying large language models could be impactful for other high stakes domains. Specifically, we will solicit contributions that prioritize (1) Multimodal capabilities in generative modeling, (2) Deployment critical features in generative models such as Safety, Interpretability, Robustness, Ethics, Fairness and Privacy, and (3) Human facing evaluation of generative models.

## Topics

We seek papers from all topics related to recent advances in Generative AI, including all data modalities including language and vision models. We especially encourage submissions that focus on challenges when applying Generative AI to impactful, real-world, interdisciplinary problems. Potential topics can include, but are not limited to:

- Applications to challenging real-world problems
- Interpretability, Fairness, Robustness, and Safety
- Memorization, Unlearning, and Privacy
- Multi-modal generation
- Technical challenges of deployment and implementation
- Evaluation methodologies, metrics, human-facing evaluations
- Novel methods and architectures
