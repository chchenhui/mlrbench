        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses a key topic mentioned in the workshop call ('Equivariant world models for robotics') and elaborates significantly on the provided research idea. The methodology incorporates concepts from geometric deep learning (equivariance, SE(2)/SE(3) groups) and world models, reflecting both the task's focus and the research idea's core concept. It also implicitly aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as generalization across variations and sim-to-real transfer, by leveraging symmetry."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step plan, including specific network types (e-convs, TFNs), model architecture choices (latent-state model), mathematical formulations for equivariance and loss functions, RL integration strategy (MPC), and a comprehensive evaluation plan with defined tasks, baselines, metrics, and implementation details. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While equivariant networks and world models exist independently, the specific integration of SE(2)/SE(3) equivariance systematically throughout a modern latent-state world model architecture (encoder, transition, decoder, reward predictor) for robotic manipulation and navigation, combined with model-based RL (MPC), represents a novel synthesis. It distinguishes itself from prior work focusing primarily on equivariant policies (like EquivAct) or geometric RL without explicit world model equivariance. The novelty lies in applying rigorous geometric deep learning principles specifically to the *predictive model* component within an MBRL framework for robotics."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in geometric deep learning (group equivariance, SE(2)/SE(3) representations), world models (PlaNet/Dreamer architectures), and model-based reinforcement learning (MPC). The proposed methodology, including the use of equivariant convolutions, Tensor Field Networks, and an equivariant latent transition model, is technically well-founded and appropriate for the stated goals. The inclusion of specific loss components, regularization considerations, and a detailed, statistically validated experimental design further enhances its rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and expertise in geometric deep learning, RL, and robotics. Implementing and training complex equivariant world models is challenging and computationally intensive, requiring careful engineering and tuning. Sim-to-real transfer also presents inherent difficulties. However, the plan is realistic, leveraging existing network architectures and RL techniques. The required resources (compute, simulation environments like MuJoCo, potentially a real robot like UR5) are standard for leading robotics research labs. The risks are manageable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of sample efficiency and generalization in robotic learning, which is a major bottleneck for real-world deployment. By rigorously incorporating geometric priors (SE(2)/SE(3) symmetry) into world models, the research has the potential to lead to substantial improvements (proposed 3x-10x gain) in learning speed and robustness. Success would represent a significant advancement in model-based RL for robotics and provide a strong practical demonstration of the benefits of geometric deep learning, aligning perfectly with the workshop's themes and potentially influencing future work in embodied AI."
