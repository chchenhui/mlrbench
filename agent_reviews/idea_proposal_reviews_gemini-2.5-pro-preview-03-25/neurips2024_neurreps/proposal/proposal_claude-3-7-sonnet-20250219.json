        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's specific interest in 'Equivariant world models for robotics'. The methodology clearly implements the core research idea of using group-equivariant networks (SE(2)/SE(3)) within a world model framework to improve sample efficiency and generalization in robotics. It acknowledges and aims to build upon the concepts and challenges identified in the provided literature review, such as leveraging geometric priors (Alhousani et al., Yan et al.), achieving generalization across transformations (Yang et al.), and tackling sim-to-real transfer."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction effectively motivates the problem and introduces the core idea. The methodology section is detailed, outlining the problem formulation, architecture (including specific groups like SE(2)/SE(3), state representation, encoders, dynamics/reward models), training procedures (loss functions, data collection, policy learning), and a comprehensive experimental plan. Objectives and expected outcomes are explicitly stated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While geometric deep learning and equivariant networks are established fields, and prior work exists on geometric RL and equivariant policies (as shown in the literature review), the specific focus on constructing *equivariant world models* (predicting both dynamics and rewards with equivariance constraints) for sample-efficient robot learning represents a novel synthesis. It extends existing work by integrating these principles directly into the predictive model component of model-based RL, rather than solely focusing on policy or representation learning. The combination of world modeling, explicit SE(2)/SE(3) equivariance, and application to robotics for sample efficiency is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of MDPs, world models, RL, and geometric deep learning (equivariance). The proposed methodology, including the use of group-equivariant layers (G-CNNs, EGNNs), appropriate loss functions (dynamics, reward, explicit equivariance loss), and standard model-based RL training paradigms, is technically well-founded. The mathematical formulation of equivariance is correct. Minor areas that require careful implementation include the integration of potentially non-equivariant proprioceptive/task information and actions within the equivariant framework (though 'steerable action conditioning' suggests awareness) and ensuring the chosen symmetry group accurately reflects task dynamics. Overall, the technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. The required technologies (equivariant networks, RL algorithms, simulation environments) exist, and libraries are available. However, implementing, training, and debugging equivariant models, particularly SE(3) networks integrated into a full RL loop, is complex and computationally intensive. Access to specified robotic hardware (7-DOF arm, mobile robot) is necessary for real-world validation. While the plan is logical, achieving robust performance and successful sim-to-real transfer requires considerable expertise and effort. The risks associated with implementation complexity and potential gaps between theory and practice are manageable but non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in robotics: the high sample complexity and limited generalization of current learning methods. By proposing equivariant world models, it targets fundamental improvements in data efficiency and adaptability. Success would represent a major advancement, enabling robots to learn complex tasks much faster and generalize better to variations common in real-world settings. The potential impact spans robotics applications (manipulation, navigation), automation, and contributes significantly to the intersection of geometric deep learning and embodied AI, aligning perfectly with the workshop's themes. The outlined broader impacts are substantial and plausible."
