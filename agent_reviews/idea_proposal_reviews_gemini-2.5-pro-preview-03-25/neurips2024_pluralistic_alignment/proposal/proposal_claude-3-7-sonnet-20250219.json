    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for methods handling diverse values, conflicting perspectives, and multi-objective alignment. The proposal meticulously elaborates on the MOVR research idea, detailing its components and rationale. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and cites the provided literature, explicitly referencing key papers (e.g., Doe & Smith, 2023; Davis & Brown, 2023; Martinez & Wilson, 2023; Taylor & Harris, 2023) to position the work and justify its approach. It also explicitly addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as resolving value conflicts and ensuring transparency."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes). The objectives are explicitly listed and easy to understand. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the MOVR framework, including its components (value representation, elicitation, arbitration, interpretability), mathematical formulations, and model architecture concepts. The experimental design, datasets, metrics, and user study plans are clearly articulated. The language is precise, and technical concepts are explained well, minimizing ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it builds upon existing work in multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), vector-valued RL, and preference elicitation (as cited in the literature review), the core contribution – the MOVR framework itself – presents a novel synthesis. Specifically, the combination of vector-valued representation *specifically for maintaining distinct value systems* rather than just optimizing multiple objectives, coupled with the proposed *context-sensitive arbitration mechanism* (consensus-seeking, trade-off surfacing, adaptive weighting), offers a fresh perspective on pluralistic AI alignment. It moves beyond simple aggregation or standard MORL approaches by explicitly aiming to represent and navigate value diversity."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established research areas like MORL (Doe & Smith, 2023), vector-valued RL (Davis & Brown, 2023), and preference elicitation (Martinez & Wilson, 2023). The proposed methodology is detailed, outlining specific components, learning objectives (including diversity and consistency terms), and evaluation strategies. The mathematical formulation for the value function and arbitration strategies is provided. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics. The inclusion of limitations and ethical considerations further strengthens its soundness. Minor areas, like the precise implementation details of the meta-network or the diversity loss term, could benefit from further elaboration, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, particularly regarding data collection and evaluation. While the technical implementation of the MOVR model using existing ML frameworks seems achievable, collecting a *new* content moderation dataset from diverse demographic groups, ensuring representative sampling, and handling annotation disagreements is a substantial undertaking requiring significant resources and time. Similarly, conducting mixed-methods user studies with 200 stratified participants and deliberative workshops is ambitious and resource-intensive. Adapting existing datasets might be more practical initially. The core algorithmic development appears feasible, but the empirical validation plan poses considerable practical hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely challenge in AI alignment: how to make AI systems function effectively and ethically in pluralistic societies with diverse and often conflicting values. This directly aligns with the workshop's central theme. Successfully developing the MOVR framework could lead to major advancements in AI alignment, HCI, and AI ethics. The potential applications in content moderation, healthcare, and policy are substantial. By aiming to represent rather than erase value diversity, the work has the potential for transformative societal impact, fostering more inclusive and democratically accountable AI."
