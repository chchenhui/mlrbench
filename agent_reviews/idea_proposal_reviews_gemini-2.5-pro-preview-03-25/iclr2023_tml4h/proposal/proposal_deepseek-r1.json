    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of trustworthy ML for healthcare, specifically focusing on multi-modal fusion, uncertainty estimation, robustness to data corruption (generalization), and interpretability – all key topics mentioned in the task description. The methodology precisely implements the research idea of dynamic reliability estimation using BNNs, self-supervision, and attention. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and builds upon the cited literature by proposing a novel approach to handle noise/missing data (dynamic reliability) and citing relevant recent works (MDA, DRIFA-Net, DrFuse) as baselines, positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The use of sections and subsections enhances readability. Mathematical formulations for reliability score and fusion are provided, making the core mechanism understandable. The experimental plan is detailed with specific datasets, corruption methods, baselines, and metrics. While minor implementation details (e.g., specific BNN architecture, optimizer choices) are omitted, this is appropriate for a proposal, and the overall concept and plan are exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like BNNs for uncertainty, self-supervised learning, and attention for fusion exist, the core novelty lies in their specific combination to create a *dynamic modality reliability score* derived from BNN uncertainty and refined via self-supervised corruption prediction. This score is then explicitly used to weight modalities during fusion. This differs from prior work like MDA (attention for missing/noise) or DRIFA-Net (MC dropout for general uncertainty) by proposing a more direct, uncertainty-grounded, and dynamically estimated reliability measure per modality at inference time. The integration of the self-supervised task specifically for reliability assessment further enhances the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It leverages well-established techniques: Bayesian Neural Networks for principled uncertainty quantification, self-supervised learning for representation enhancement, and attention mechanisms for adaptive fusion. The derivation of the reliability score from BNN variance is theoretically justified. The proposed methodology, including the joint loss function and the experimental design (using standard datasets, relevant baselines, and comprehensive metrics covering performance, calibration, robustness, and interpretability), is robust and well-justified. The technical formulations presented are clear and appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required techniques (BNNs via variational inference, self-supervised learning, attention) are implementable with standard ML frameworks and hardware (GPUs). The chosen datasets (MIMIC, TCGA) are standard benchmarks in the field, although access might require approvals. Simulating data corruption is straightforward. While training BNNs can be computationally more demanding than deterministic models and tuning the components (e.g., loss weighting factor λ) might require effort, these are standard research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks. The overall plan is realistic and implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying multi-modal ML in healthcare: the lack of trust due to model overconfidence when faced with unreliable or corrupted data sources. By explicitly estimating modality reliability and providing uncertainty-aware predictions, the proposed framework has the potential to significantly enhance the trustworthiness, safety, and clinical acceptance of medical AI systems. Improving robustness and interpretability in multi-modal fusion directly contributes to accelerating the 'landing of ML in healthcare,' as mentioned in the task description. The creation of benchmarks for reliability-aware fusion would also be a valuable community contribution."
