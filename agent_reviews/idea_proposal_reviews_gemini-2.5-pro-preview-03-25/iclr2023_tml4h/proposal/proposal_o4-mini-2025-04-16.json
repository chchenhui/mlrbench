        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the 'Trustworthy Machine Learning for Healthcare' task, including multi-modal fusion, uncertainty estimation, robustness (generalization/OOD), and interpretability (explainability). It perfectly elaborates on the provided research idea, detailing the dynamic reliability estimation concept. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and positions itself relative to the recent works cited in the literature review (MDA, DRIFA-Net, HEALNet, DrFuse are listed as baselines) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified therein (missing data, noise, uncertainty, interpretability)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and evaluation plan are articulated precisely and logically. The core objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology section provides sufficient detail on data, architecture (BNNs, reliability computation, attention, ACD task), training, and evaluation metrics. Mathematical formulations are included and clear. Expected outcomes are specific and quantified. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the 'in-house cohort' (acknowledged as needing IRB) but do not detract significantly from the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While utilizing established components like Bayesian Neural Networks (via MC Dropout), attention mechanisms, and auxiliary tasks, the specific combination and application are novel. The core innovation lies in dynamically estimating per-modality reliability based on Bayesian uncertainty at inference time, using these estimates directly as attention weights for fusion, and augmenting this process with a dedicated self-supervised Auxiliary Corruption Detection (ACD) task. This approach differs from the cited literature (MDA, DRIFA-Net, HEALNet, DrFuse) which employ attention or uncertainty in different ways (e.g., general attention, model-level uncertainty, disease-specific weights). The explicit focus on learning to quantify modality degradation via ACD to inform fusion weights is a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in Bayesian deep learning (MC Dropout for uncertainty), attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning. The proposed methodology is technically robust: the use of BNNs for uncertainty is standard, the reliability calculation is plausible (though requiring tuning), the attention mechanism is appropriate, and the ACD task is a reasonable approach. Technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse metrics covering discrimination, calibration, uncertainty, and robustness, ablation studies, and statistical validation. The approach is well-justified and methodologically rigorous."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It primarily relies on publicly available datasets (MIMIC, TCGA), mitigating major data acquisition hurdles. The mention of an in-house dataset adds value but is not strictly essential for the core methodology validation. The proposed methods (MC Dropout, attention, standard CNNs/Transformers as backbones, auxiliary loss) are well-established and readily implementable using standard deep learning frameworks and hardware (GPUs). The corruption simulation techniques are straightforward. The evaluation plan uses standard procedures. The main minor risk involves potential delays with IRB approval for the optional in-house data, but the project is feasible without it."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the clinical adoption of AI: the trustworthiness of multi-modal models dealing with real-world data imperfections (noise, missingness, OOD shifts). By aiming to improve robustness, calibration, and interpretability through dynamic reliability assessment, the research has the potential to lead to safer and more reliable clinical decision support systems. Enhancing clinician trust is a major goal. The plan to provide open-source code and benchmarks further amplifies its potential impact on the research community, potentially setting a standard for evaluating reliability in multi-modal fusion for healthcare."
