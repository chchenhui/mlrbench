        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Trustworthy Machine Learning for Healthcare' by focusing on reliability and uncertainty in multi-modal fusion. It explicitly tackles listed topics such as 'Uncertainty estimation of ML models and medical data', 'Multi-modal fusion and learning', and implicitly contributes to 'Generalization' (robustness to degraded inputs) and 'Explainability' (interpretable attention maps). The proposal to create a 'benchmark' also aligns with the workshop's scope. The application domain (medical data fusion) is central to the workshop's interests."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem of modality reliability in multi-modal fusion and its impact on trust. The main idea (dynamic reliability estimation) is stated concisely. The proposed technical approach (BNNs for uncertainty, attention for weighting, self-supervised task for training) is specific and understandable. The expected outcomes and potential impact are also clearly articulated, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While multi-modal fusion, Bayesian neural networks, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning are existing concepts, their specific combination to dynamically estimate modality-specific reliability during inference for trustworthy medical fusion is innovative. The framing around modality reliability as a key component of trustworthiness in this context, coupled with the proposed self-supervised training strategy for reliability estimation, offers a fresh perspective compared to standard fusion techniques that often assume uniform data quality."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core components (BNNs, attention, self-supervised learning) are established ML techniques with available frameworks and libraries. While BNNs can be computationally intensive, tractable approximations exist. The main challenge lies in acquiring or simulating suitable multi-modal medical datasets with realistic modality degradation (noise, missingness, low quality). Simulating degradation is straightforward; obtaining diverse real-world examples might require more effort but is achievable. Overall, implementation is practical with current technology and standard research resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck ('trust gap') hindering the real-world adoption of multi-modal ML in healthcare â€“ the handling of unreliable or corrupted data sources. Improving robustness, providing uncertainty quantification, and enhancing transparency (interpretability) are crucial for safety and clinical acceptance. Success would lead to more reliable diagnostic tools, reduce the risk of errors due to poor data quality, and potentially establish a new standard for evaluating and building trustworthy multi-modal fusion models in medicine."
