    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed for the 'Trustworthy Machine Learning for Healthcare Workshop', including 'Explainability', 'Generalization to out-of-distribution samples', 'Human-machine cooperation (human-in-the-loop, active learning)', and 'Multi-modal fusion'. The core motivation of enhancing trust through interpretability and robustness perfectly matches the workshop's central theme."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation, the main goal (interpretable and robust models), the specific methodologies to be employed (XAI, robustness techniques, multi-modal fusion, human-in-the-loop), expected outcomes, and potential impact. The use of specific examples like SHAP/LIME and adversarial training enhances clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While the individual components (XAI methods like SHAP/LIME, robustness techniques like adversarial training, multi-modal fusion, human-in-the-loop) are established research areas and techniques, the proposed novelty lies in their specific integration and application to create models that are simultaneously interpretable and robust within the healthcare diagnostics context, potentially using a specific combination tailored for this domain. It doesn't propose fundamentally new algorithms but rather a valuable synthesis and application of existing advanced techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The proposed techniques (SHAP, LIME, adversarial training, domain adaptation, active learning) are well-documented and implementable with existing ML frameworks. However, practical implementation faces challenges common in healthcare ML: securing access to diverse, multi-modal, high-quality medical data while adhering to strict privacy regulations, and establishing effective human-in-the-loop workflows requiring clinician time and collaboration. Integrating all components robustly also requires significant engineering effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Lack of interpretability and robustness are major barriers to the clinical adoption of AI diagnostic tools. Addressing these issues directly tackles a critical problem in the field, as emphasized by the workshop's theme. Success in this research could significantly enhance clinician trust, improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability, facilitate wider AI adoption in healthcare, and ultimately benefit patient care."
