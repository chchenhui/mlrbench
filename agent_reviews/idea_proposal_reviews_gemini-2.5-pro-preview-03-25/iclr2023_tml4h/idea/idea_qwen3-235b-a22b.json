        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed for the 'Trustworthy Machine Learning for Healthcare Workshop', including 'Uncertainty estimation', 'Reasoning, intervening, or causal inference', 'Generalization to out-of-distribution samples', and implicitly 'Explainability' and 'Debiasing ML models from learning shortcuts'. The focus on improving model reliability and clinical trust in medical diagnosis using causal principles fits squarely within the workshop's central theme of developing trustworthy ML for healthcare."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation clearly outlines the problem with existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods lacking causal grounding. The main idea describes the proposed solution (causally disentangled BNN, causal discovery, uncertainty propagation) and its intended application (medical imaging). The inclusion of an example (prostate cancer) and validation strategy enhances clarity. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific 'hybrid architecture' or the exact causal discovery techniques envisioned, but the overall concept and research direction are well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While causal inference, disentangled representation learning, Bayesian neural networks, and uncertainty quantification exist as separate research areas, their proposed integration to create *causally-grounded* uncertainty estimates specifically for robust medical diagnosis is novel. It moves beyond standard statistical UQ by explicitly modeling and leveraging causal structure to inform uncertainty, aiming to differentiate uncertainty arising from causal factors versus spurious correlations or artifacts. This specific combination and application focus offer a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Key challenges include: 1) Reliable causal discovery from complex, high-dimensional observational data (like medical images) is notoriously difficult and often requires strong assumptions or extensive domain knowledge. 2) Integrating causal structure discovery, disentangled representation learning, and Bayesian inference into a single, stable, and scalable framework is technically complex. 3) Validating that the uncertainty quantification is truly 'causally correct' is non-trivial and goes beyond standard calibration metrics, requiring careful design of counterfactual benchmarks and potentially subjective clinician feedback interpretation. While the individual components exist, their successful integration and validation require considerable expertise and effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical barrier to the clinical adoption of ML: the lack of robustness and trustworthiness, particularly when models encounter data shifts common in real-world healthcare settings. Unreliable uncertainty estimates can lead to incorrect or overconfident predictions with potentially severe consequences. By aiming to ground UQ in causal mechanisms, the research could lead to more reliable, interpretable, and robust diagnostic tools, directly contributing to safer AI deployment in high-stakes medical applications and fostering greater clinical trust. This directly aligns with the workshop's goal of accelerating the landing of ML in healthcare."
