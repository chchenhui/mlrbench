        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop topic 'Designing and optimizing novel and useful biomolecules' and explicitly fits into the 'Open challenges' special track, specifically mentioning 'biological experiment design with GenerativeAI-in-the-loop'. The proposal uses generative AI (generative surrogates) for biomolecule optimization, integrating it with experimental validation, which is central to the workshop's theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (reducing experimental cost/time), the core components (generative surrogate, Bayesian Optimization, active learning loop, wet-lab feedback), and the overall goal (accelerated discovery) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The concept of 'GenerativeAI-in-the-loop' is explicitly mentioned and explained within the context of the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While active learning, Bayesian Optimization, and generative models are individually established, their specific integration for *biomolecule* optimization using generative models as *differentiable surrogates* within an active *wet-lab* experimental design loop offers a fresh perspective. The novelty lies primarily in the application domain and the specific combination of techniques to address the experimental bottleneck in generative biology, rather than inventing fundamentally new ML algorithms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Generative models for biomolecules and Bayesian Optimization frameworks are available. However, implementation presents moderate challenges, particularly in efficiently integrating the ML loop with the inherently slower and resource-intensive wet-lab synthesis and testing cycle. Success depends on the quality of the initial surrogate, the effectiveness of the BO strategy in selecting informative experiments, and the logistics of the experimental feedback loop. It requires significant interdisciplinary expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Optimizing biomolecules is crucial for drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and biotechnology. Addressing the bottleneck of costly and slow experimental validation through intelligent experimental design could dramatically accelerate scientific discovery and lead to major advancements in medicine and bio-engineering. The potential impact on reducing resources and time-to-discovery is substantial."
