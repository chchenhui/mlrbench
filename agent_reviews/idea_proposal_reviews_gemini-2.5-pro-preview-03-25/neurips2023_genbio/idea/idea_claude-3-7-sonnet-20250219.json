        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. The GenBio workshop explicitly lists 'Designing and optimizing novel and useful biomolecules', 'Rational protein design: Prediction and optimization of protein sequences and/or structures, incorporating constraints and prior knowledge', 'Sequence-based methods: large language models for protein / genomic sequences', and 'Geometric deep learning: generative modeling of biological structures' as key topics. FoldForge directly addresses these by proposing a framework that integrates geometric deep learning and language models for constrained protein design, aiming to optimize both structure and function (semantic properties)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation clearly defines the problem (disconnect between structural precision and functional requirements). The main idea outlines the core components (geometric pipeline, LM pipeline), the integration method (cross-attention), and the goal (joint optimization conditioned on structure and function). Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the 'novel cross-attention mechanism' and the exact architectural details, but the overall concept and approach are well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While geometric deep learning for structure and protein LMs for sequence/function are established fields, the proposed *joint* optimization framework integrating both via a *novel cross-attention mechanism* for simultaneous conditioning on geometric and semantic properties represents a fresh approach. It moves beyond using these techniques independently or in simpler sequential pipelines. The novelty lies in the specific synthesis and simultaneous optimization strategy, rather than inventing entirely new base components."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Geometric deep learning models and protein LMs are mature fields with available tools and datasets (PDB, UniProt). However, integrating these complex models into a stable joint optimization framework presents significant engineering challenges. Training such a system will likely require substantial computational resources. Designing and validating the novel cross-attention mechanism and ensuring the generation of biologically viable proteins will require careful implementation and rigorous testing, potentially including experimental validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Designing proteins with precise structures and desired functions is a grand challenge in biotechnology and medicine. Addressing the limitation of current methods that struggle to balance these aspects could lead to major advancements. If successful, FoldForge could significantly accelerate the development of novel biologics, enzymes, and other functional proteins, directly impacting therapeutic discovery and synthetic biology, addressing critical needs mentioned in the motivation."
