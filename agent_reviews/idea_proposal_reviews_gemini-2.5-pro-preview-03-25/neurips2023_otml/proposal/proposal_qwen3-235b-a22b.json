    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (focusing on OT generalizations like UOT and applications like domain adaptation), the research idea (directly proposing Adaptive UOT for label shift), and the literature review (explicitly addressing identified challenges like label shift handling and UOT parameter selection, building upon cited works). It fits squarely within the OTML workshop topics, targeting a specific, relevant problem within that scope."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, with defined objectives, methodology, and experimental plan. The core idea of A-UOT is well-articulated. However, there's a minor inconsistency in describing the networks learning the adaptive parameters (\\alpha, \\beta) - initially mentioned as CNNs (\\psi_{CNN}, \\phi_{CNN}) in Sec 2.2.1 but later specified as simpler linear functions in Sec 2.3. This slight ambiguity slightly detracts from perfect clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. The core novelty lies in making the Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) marginal relaxation parameters (\\alpha, \\beta) learnable functions of data statistics (specifically pseudo-label estimates) within an end-to-end deep domain adaptation framework. While UOT and DA under label shift are known concepts, automatically adapting these specific UOT parameters based on pseudo-labels appears to be a novel contribution compared to existing fixed-parameter UOT methods cited in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, building upon established OT/UOT theory and domain adaptation techniques (pseudo-labeling, entropy minimization). The mathematical formulation for A-UOT is a plausible extension of UOT. However, the reliance on pseudo-label quality, especially early in training, poses a potential risk to stability and convergence, which isn't explicitly addressed with mitigation strategies. Additionally, the practical aspects of optimizing the learnable parameters (\\alpha, \\beta) through Sinkhorn iterations might present challenges not fully detailed. The minor inconsistency in describing the parameter-learning network also slightly impacts perceived rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using standard deep learning tools, libraries, and benchmark datasets. The experimental plan is realistic. However, implementing the adaptive learning of UOT parameters (\\alpha, \\beta) within the optimization loop, particularly ensuring correct gradient flow through Sinkhorn and the adaptive functions, requires careful engineering and is non-trivial. Potential training instability, linked to the soundness concerns about pseudo-label dependency, represents a moderate risk that might require significant tuning or algorithmic refinement."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant and practical problem: robust domain adaptation under label shift, which is critical for real-world ML deployments (e.g., healthcare, autonomous systems). By tackling the key limitation of fixed parameter tuning in UOT, the proposed A-UOT method has the potential to make UOT more practical and effective for DA. If successful in achieving the expected performance gains, particularly on challenging datasets with severe label shifts, the work would represent a meaningful contribution to the field."
