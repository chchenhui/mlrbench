    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (OT for ML, UOT generalizations, DA applications), the research idea (Adaptive UOT for label shift), and the literature review (builds on Fatras et al., Rakotomamonjy et al., addresses UOT parameter selection challenge). It clearly situates the work within the OTML field, directly elaborates the core idea, and positions itself relative to the cited literature, addressing identified gaps like fixed UOT parameters and label shift handling."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, research gap, proposed A-UOT idea, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides clear mathematical formulations for OT, UOT, and the proposed A-UOT, including the learnable parameters and the overall objective. The algorithmic steps and experimental plan are detailed and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist only around the precise implementation details of the gradient calculation for the adaptive parameters, which is acceptable at the proposal stage."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. The core idea of learning the UOT marginal relaxation parameters (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) end-to-end within a deep DA framework, specifically to adapt to unknown label shifts, is novel. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work using fixed UOT parameters (Fatras et al., 2021) or methods that estimate target proportions separately (Rakotomamonjy et al., 2020). While building on existing UOT concepts, the adaptive learning mechanism represents a fresh and significant contribution to OT-based DA."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established OT/UOT theory and standard deep DA practices. The mathematical formulation of A-UOT, including the parameterization of learnable relaxation coefficients and the combined loss function, is coherent. The proposed mechanism for learning the parameters via gradient descent (using implicit differentiation or envelope theorem) is theoretically sound, although its empirical effectiveness is the core research question. The methodology is generally well-defined and based on solid foundations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents a moderate implementation challenge. Using standard DA datasets and deep learning frameworks is straightforward. Implementing UOT solvers is feasible with existing libraries. The main challenge lies in correctly implementing the backpropagation through the UOT solver to get gradients for the learnable relaxation parameters (\\boldsymbol{\\theta}). This requires advanced auto-differentiation techniques or careful application of the envelope theorem, increasing complexity compared to standard DA models. However, it is achievable with appropriate expertise. The research risks regarding the optimization and effectiveness of the learned parameters are moderate."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant and practical problem in domain adaptation: robustness to unknown label shifts. If successful, A-UOT could lead to more reliable DA models with less need for manual parameter tuning or explicit label shift estimation, enhancing practical applicability. It also represents an interesting advancement in OTML by introducing an adaptive component directly into the UOT formulation for a specific ML task. The potential impact on the field of domain adaptation is considerable."
