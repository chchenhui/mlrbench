        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for robust domain adaptation under label shift, a topic relevant to the OTML workshop (OT for ML, UOT, domain adaptation). The core idea of Adaptive UOT (A-UOT) stems directly from the provided research idea and tackles limitations of standard OT and fixed-parameter UOT identified in the literature review (e.g., label shift handling, parameter selection). The objectives and methodology are logically derived from this context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is partially clear. The overall goal, motivation, and high-level plan are understandable. However, crucial technical details regarding the core A-UOT mechanism are ambiguous or poorly defined. Specifically, the provided UOT cost function formula is non-standard and its derivation or justification is missing. It's unclear precisely how the 'learnable parameters controlling marginal constraints' are integrated into the UOT formulation and optimized. Furthermore, the evaluation metric 'Label Shift Compensation' is not defined, leaving its measurement method unclear. These ambiguities hinder a complete understanding of the proposed method."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While UOT for domain adaptation and handling label shift are existing concepts (as shown in the literature review), the core idea of making the UOT marginal relaxation parameters *learnable* and adaptive to the data during training appears novel. Existing methods typically use fixed relaxation parameters or estimate target label proportions separately. This adaptive approach offers a fresh perspective on tackling label shift within the UOT framework for domain adaptation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal has significant weaknesses in its technical soundness. While the motivation (addressing label shift via adaptive UOT) is sound and builds on established OT/UOT concepts, the proposed methodology lacks rigor in its core formulation. The provided UOT cost function is non-standard and appears questionable without further justification or connection to established UOT theory (e.g., KL/TV divergences for marginal relaxation). The mechanism for learning the adaptive parameters is underspecified. Relying on an unclear or potentially incorrect technical formulation undermines the proposal's rigor. The mention of using target statistics or pseudo-labels from the idea description is not elaborated upon in the methodology."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Implementing deep domain adaptation models with OT/UOT components is achievable with current deep learning frameworks and OT libraries. Using public datasets is standard. While UOT can be computationally intensive, minibatch strategies exist. The main challenge lies in correctly formulating and implementing the novel adaptive parameter learning mechanism within the UOT framework, including handling potential optimization stability issues. Assuming a sound reformulation of the A-UOT mechanism, the project is implementable with standard ML resources (GPUs, software)."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in domain adaptation: robustness to label shift, which is common in real-world applications and a known limitation of many standard methods. Developing a method (A-UOT) that automatically adapts the degree of mass relaxation in UOT without requiring prior knowledge or manual tuning of relaxation parameters would be a valuable contribution. Success would likely lead to more robust and practical domain adaptation systems, impacting fields like computer vision and NLP, aligning well with the goals of advancing OT for ML."
