    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed for the OTML workshop, including 'Unbalanced formulation (OT between measures of different mass)' under Generalizations of Optimal Transport, and 'OT to define data transformations (domain adaptation)' under Optimal Transport for Machine Learning and Applications. It tackles a specific challenge (label shift) within the application of OT to domain adaptation, making it highly relevant to the workshop's focus on bridging OT theory and ML practice."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the motivation (limitations of standard OT/UOT for DA under label shift), the main proposal (Adaptive UOT with learnable marginal relaxation), the proposed mechanism (joint optimization, potential guidance), and the expected outcome (improved robustness). The concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While using OT/UOT for domain adaptation and addressing label shift are existing research areas, the core novelty lies in proposing an *adaptive* mechanism to learn the UOT marginal relaxation parameters directly from data within the deep learning framework, specifically for handling label shift. This contrasts with methods using fixed parameters or simpler heuristics. It offers a fresh perspective on tuning UOT for this specific problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Deep domain adaptation frameworks and UOT algorithms are established. The main challenge lies in the implementation details of the joint optimization: parameterizing the learnable marginal constraints and ensuring stable training when optimizing these alongside the main network parameters and potentially using noisy signals like pseudo-labels. This may require careful engineering and tuning but is achievable with current deep learning and optimization techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant with clear impact potential. Domain adaptation is crucial for deploying ML models in the real world, and label shift is a common, practical challenge that degrades performance. Developing methods robust to label shift is important. This research directly addresses this issue using a principled OT-based approach, potentially leading to more reliable domain adaptation systems and meaningful contributions to the field."
