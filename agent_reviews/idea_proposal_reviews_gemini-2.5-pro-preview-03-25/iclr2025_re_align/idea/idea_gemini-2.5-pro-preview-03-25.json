    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly asks 'How can we systematically increase (or decrease) representational alignment among biological and artificial systems?' and 'What are the implications (positive and negative) of increasing or decreasing representational alignment...?'. The proposed idea directly addresses these questions by suggesting a method to control alignment during training via loss functions and proposing to analyze the trade-offs and functional consequences. It fits squarely within the workshop's central theme of intervening on alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (proactive control vs. post-hoc observation), the core mechanism (incorporating alignment metrics like CKA/RSA into the loss), the goal (matching/diverging from a target representation), and the expected outcomes (demonstrating control, analyzing trade-offs) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It is immediately understandable. Minor details about specific loss formulations could be added, but the concept itself is exceptionally clear."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While representational similarity metrics (CKA, RSA) are established tools for *analyzing* alignment post-hoc, and loss function engineering is common, the proposal to *directly integrate these metrics into the training objective for explicit, controllable alignment* is a relatively novel approach in this specific context. It moves beyond passive observation or implicit alignment through shared tasks, offering a direct intervention mechanism. It combines existing concepts (alignment metrics, regularization) in a fresh way to tackle a specific problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Calculating alignment metrics like CKA/RSA is possible, though potentially computationally intensive during training. Modifying loss functions is standard practice in deep learning. Accessing target representations from other models is straightforward; accessing and processing brain data presents more challenges but is common in neuro-AI research. Key challenges include the computational overhead of calculating alignment repeatedly and carefully balancing the alignment regularization term against the primary task objective, but these seem like engineering challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks. Overall, implementation appears practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Being able to control representational alignment would be a powerful tool for systematically investigating its functional consequences, addressing a key gap mentioned in the motivation. Potential impacts include enhancing interpretability (by aligning models to understandable representations), improving transfer learning, facilitating brain-computer interface development (by aligning AI with neural signals), and providing a concrete method to study the relationship between internal representations and system behavior. It directly addresses fundamental questions about how representations relate across systems."
