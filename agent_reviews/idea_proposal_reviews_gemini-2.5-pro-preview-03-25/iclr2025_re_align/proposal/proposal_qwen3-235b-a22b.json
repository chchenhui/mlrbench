    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the Re-Align workshop's central theme of understanding and intervening in representational alignment between biological and artificial systems. It incorporates the core concepts from the research idea (two-stage joint clustering and PCL) and builds upon the cited literature, explicitly tackling challenges identified therein (interpretable anchors, intervention, generalizability). The objectives and methodology directly map to the workshop's interest in developing new metrics, enabling intervention, and exploring shared computational strategies. It also connects to the hackathon goal by proposing reproducible methods and benchmarks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The two-stage approach (Prototype Discovery and Training with Prototype Regularization) is presented sequentially and is easy to follow. Key technical details, such as the PCL loss function and normalization steps, are explicitly provided. The experimental design, including baselines and metrics, is clearly outlined. There is minimal ambiguity, making the proposal readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While it builds upon existing concepts like Prototypical Contrastive Learning (Li et al., 2020) and joint clustering for alignment (Blue & Red, 2024), the specific combination and application are innovative. The core novelty lies in using prototypes derived from *joint* brain-DNN clustering as *fixed anchors* within a PCL framework to *actively train* DNNs for alignment. This contrasts with standard PCL (unsupervised), post-hoc alignment methods (RSA), or alignment methods that don't use explicit, jointly-derived prototypes as trainable targets. The integration provides a novel mechanism for both measuring and intervening in alignment based on interpretable anchors."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is methodologically sound and rigorous. It grounds itself in established techniques like k-means clustering and PCL. The proposed PCL loss function is a standard formulation adapted for this specific task. The plan to use paired brain-DNN datasets and standard preprocessing techniques is appropriate. The inclusion of prototype pruning based on semantic relevance and cognitive taxonomies adds rigor to the prototype discovery stage. The experimental design includes relevant baselines, comprehensive metrics (neural, behavioral, transfer, robustness), and statistical validation, demonstrating a thorough approach. Minor potential weaknesses, such as the sensitivity of k-means or ensuring prototype stability, are acknowledged implicitly by the validation steps."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on publicly available datasets (e.g., BOLD5000, Algonauts) and standard machine learning techniques (k-means, PCL implemented in common frameworks). The required computational resources are typical for DNN research. The two-stage methodology is logical and implementable. Potential challenges include obtaining high-quality paired data (if new experiments are needed), ensuring the joint clustering yields meaningful and stable prototypes, and fine-tuning the PCL process to achieve alignment without significantly degrading task performance. However, these are considered standard research risks rather than fundamental feasibility barriers. The plan appears practical within a well-resourced research environment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal holds high significance and potential impact. It addresses critical limitations in the field of representational alignment, namely the lack of interpretable anchors and mechanisms for direct intervention, which are central themes of the Re-Align workshop. Success would provide a novel framework to not only measure but actively steer DNN representations towards brain-like states, potentially offering deep insights into shared computational principles. The development of interpretable, prototype-based alignment metrics could improve robustness and generalizability. Furthermore, the work has clear potential contributions to neuroscience (interpreting brain activity), AI safety (linking to value alignment through controlled neural-likeness), and open science (reproducible benchmarks)."
