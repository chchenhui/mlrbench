    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the Re-Align workshop's central theme of understanding when/why systems align and how to intervene, explicitly tackling questions about robust metrics, intervention strategies, and shared computational strategies. The methodology directly implements the research idea (joint prototypes, contrastive loss). It effectively synthesizes and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself clearly against existing methods (RSA, CKA, ReAlnet, PCL) and addressing key challenges identified in the review (interpretability, generalizability, intervention)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step description of the proposed framework, including mathematical formulations for the joint clustering and the prototypical contrastive loss. The experimental design, evaluation metrics, and implementation details are specific and easy to understand. The rationale and significance are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and facilitates comprehension. Minor ambiguities exist (e.g., specifics of fMRI vs. EEG handling, justification for hyperparameter choices), but they do not detract significantly from the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal integrates several existing or very recent concepts: joint clustering of brain/DNN data (similar to Blue & Red, 2024), prototypical contrastive learning (PCL by Li et al., 2020), and using a prototypical contrastive loss for alignment (very similar to Yellow & Orange, 2024). The core novelty lies in the specific synthesis of these components into a unified framework for interpretable and intervenable alignment, and its proposed empirical validation. While not introducing a fundamentally new concept, the specific combination and application to brain-DNN alignment with an emphasis on both interpretability (prototypes) and intervention (loss function) offers moderate originality. The heavy reliance on concepts seemingly introduced in the cited 2024 papers limits the score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical foundations (representational similarity, contrastive learning, clustering) and methods (PCA, k-means, DNN training). The proposed methodology, including the joint clustering approach and the prototypical contrastive loss, is technically well-defined and logically derived from prior work. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and evaluation metrics. Minor points could use further justification, such as the choice and impact of the balancing parameter alpha in clustering, the selection of K (number of prototypes), and the potential limitations of PCA. However, the overall technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The computational aspects of the proposal (joint clustering, DNN fine-tuning with custom loss, evaluation) are largely feasible using standard ML libraries and hardware (GPUs). The implementation details provided suggest practical considerations. The main feasibility challenge lies in data acquisition: obtaining paired neural (fMRI/EEG) responses from 50 subjects for 10,000 stimuli is a significant undertaking requiring substantial time, resources, and ethical approvals. Feasibility increases considerably if suitable large-scale public datasets can be leveraged. Additionally, the behavioral alignment evaluation requires eye-tracking data, which was not mentioned in the data collection plan. Assuming access to appropriate datasets, the proposal is feasible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses critical and timely challenges in representational alignment, directly relevant to the Re-Align workshop and the broader fields of ML, neuroscience, and cognitive science. By aiming to provide interpretable anchors (prototypes) and an intervention mechanism (contrastive loss), it tackles major limitations of current methods (Key Challenges 1 and 5). Success would lead to a deeper understanding of alignment, potentially improve model generalization and human-AI interaction, and offer a framework for exploring shared computational strategies and ethical implications. The potential impact on both theory and practice is substantial."
