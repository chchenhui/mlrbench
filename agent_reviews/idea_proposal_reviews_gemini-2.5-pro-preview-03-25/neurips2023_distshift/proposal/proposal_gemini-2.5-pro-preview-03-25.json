        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem highlighted in the workshop call (adapting FMs without sacrificing robustness) and precisely implements the proposed research idea (KD with a robust teacher, OOD examples, activation preservation). It effectively situates the work within the provided literature, citing key papers on robustness degradation (Kumar et al.), KD for robustness (Zhou et al.), PEFT (Hu et al.), and robust fine-tuning (Wortsman et al.), and acknowledges the identified challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The problem statement, objectives, and rationale are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed mathematical formulation of the RobustKD-FM framework, clearly defines the loss components, outlines OOD generation strategies, explains PEFT integration, and specifies datasets, baselines, metrics, and a comprehensive experimental plan including ablation studies. The structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining existing techniques in a novel way to address a specific challenge. While KD for robustness and activation matching have been explored separately or differently (e.g., Zhou et al.'s DAD, Yang et al.'s SDFT), the specific combination of using the original pre-trained FM as a frozen teacher, distilling knowledge on curated OOD examples, and simultaneously regularizing via activation pattern preservation, all integrated within a PEFT framework (like LoRA), appears to be a novel contribution distinct from the cited literature. It's not a completely groundbreaking concept but offers a fresh and well-motivated approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (KD, regularization, PEFT) and established methods. The proposed methodology, including the composite loss function and its components, is well-defined and mathematically formulated. The experimental design is comprehensive and robust, featuring standard benchmarks (WILDS, DomainBed), relevant baselines, appropriate metrics, planned ablation studies, and considerations for hyperparameter tuning. The technical formulations appear correct and clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current technology and standard ML libraries/resources. The required FMs and datasets are accessible. However, the methodology involves additional computational overhead compared to standard fine-tuning or PEFT, specifically due to the need for forward passes through the frozen teacher model for both KD loss and activation matching. Generating diverse and effective OOD samples might also require significant effort or computation. While PEFT mitigates some costs, the overall computational demand and potential need for extensive hyperparameter tuning present moderate implementation challenges, making it good but not excellent in feasibility."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem in the deployment of foundation models: the degradation of robustness during fine-tuning. This issue is a major bottleneck for real-world applications, especially in high-stakes domains mentioned in the workshop description. Successfully developing RobustKD-FM would provide a valuable tool for practitioners, potentially leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems. The research has strong potential for scientific impact by advancing understanding of FM adaptation and contributing a novel robustness technique, directly aligning with the workshop's goals."
