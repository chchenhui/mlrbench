    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem highlighted in the task description: the degradation of foundation model robustness during fine-tuning for specialized tasks. The proposed methodology, centered around constrained knowledge distillation using the original FM as a 'robustness teacher' and incorporating activation regularization, perfectly implements the research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the concepts and challenges identified in the literature review, such as the work by Kumar et al. on feature distortion, WiSE-FT for robust fine-tuning, LoRA for efficiency, and various KD approaches for robustness (like DAD, which is included as a baseline). The objectives and experimental plan are tailored to answer the specific questions posed by the task description regarding adaptation without sacrificing robustness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely and logically. The methodology section provides a clear breakdown of the algorithmic framework, including data generation, the hybrid loss function (with mathematical formulations), and the integration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The experimental design is detailed, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The structure is easy to follow, progressing logically from problem statement to proposed solution and evaluation. While minor details like the exact implementation of domain-specific OOD generation could be slightly more elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While using knowledge distillation (KD) to improve robustness is not entirely new (as evidenced by cited works like Zhou et al., 2023), the specific combination proposed here is novel. It integrates KD from the original FM (as teacher) focusing on OOD examples, explicit regularization of intermediate activation patterns (not just output logits), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) into a single framework specifically designed to preserve FM robustness during adaptation. The synthesis of OOD data using both general perturbations and domain-specific transformations adds another layer. Compared to existing works like DAD (adversarial examples + discretization) or SDFT (self-distillation), this proposal offers a distinct approach by combining output distillation, activation regularization, and PEFT. The novelty lies in this specific synergistic combination rather than a single groundbreaking component."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established concepts like knowledge distillation, activation matching, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), and standard OOD generation techniques (adversarial attacks, style transfer). The motivation is well-supported by the literature (e.g., Kumar et al.). The proposed hybrid loss function is technically plausible, combining standard task loss with KL divergence for distillation and MSE for activation matching. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant benchmarks (WILDS), strong baselines (including recent related work like DAD), appropriate metrics, and ablation studies. Technical formulations are clear and correct. Minor uncertainties exist regarding the optimal balancing of loss components (\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) and the effectiveness guarantee of synthetic OOD data, but the overall approach is methodologically robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The core techniques (KD, LoRA, data augmentation) are well-understood and implementable using standard ML libraries. Access to foundation models and benchmark datasets (like WILDS) is generally possible within the research community. The integration of LoRA significantly enhances feasibility by reducing the computational burden of fine-tuning updates. However, the process still requires significant computation, particularly for running inference on the large teacher model during distillation and potentially for generating sophisticated OOD examples. Hyperparameter tuning for the loss weights and LoRA parameters might be time-consuming. Overall, the plan is realistic, and the risks are manageable within a typical research project scope, assuming adequate computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in machine learning. The degradation of robustness when fine-tuning powerful foundation models is a major barrier to their reliable deployment in critical real-world applications like healthcare, legal NLP, and conservation, where distribution shifts are common. Successfully developing a method that preserves OOD robustness while allowing task specialization would be a major advancement. The potential impact is substantial, enabling more trustworthy AI systems. The research could also provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying FM robustness. The commitment to releasing code and benchmarks further enhances its potential contribution to the community."
