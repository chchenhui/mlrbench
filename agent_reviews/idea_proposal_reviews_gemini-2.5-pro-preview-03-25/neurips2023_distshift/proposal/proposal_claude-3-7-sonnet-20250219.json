    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem highlighted in the task description: the degradation of foundation model robustness during fine-tuning. The proposed dual-teacher knowledge distillation approach is a direct elaboration of the research idea, aiming to preserve robustness using the original model as a teacher. The methodology explicitly builds upon and differentiates itself from the cited works (e.g., WiSE-FT, DAD, SDFT, LoRA), positioning the research effectively within the current landscape described in the literature review. The focus on adaptation without sacrificing robustness, evaluation on distribution shifts, and potential modality-agnostic nature perfectly match the workshop's themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly articulates the problem, motivation, and the proposed solution's high-level concept. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the architecture (LoRA), the core dual-teacher distillation mechanism, loss functions, distribution shift simulation strategies, robust activation regularization (RAR), training procedure, and evaluation protocol. Technical formulations are presented concisely. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing concepts like knowledge distillation, PEFT (LoRA), and regularization, the specific combination and architecture are novel. The core novelty lies in the dual-teacher framework explicitly using the original foundation model as a 'robustness teacher' alongside a task-specific teacher during PEFT. This differs from weight ensembling (WiSE-FT), self-distillation (SDFT), or single-teacher distillation focused solely on robustness (like DAD, which also uses different techniques). The addition of Robust Activation Regularization (RAR) as a complementary mechanism further enhances the novelty. The proposal clearly distinguishes its approach from prior work cited in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established machine learning principles like knowledge distillation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA). The rationale for using the original model as a robustness teacher is logical. The proposed methodology, including the dual-teacher setup, loss formulations (task, robustness KD, feature KD, RAR), and distribution shift simulation techniques, is technically plausible. The mathematical formulations presented are appropriate. The comprehensive evaluation protocol, including various OOD benchmarks, robustness metrics, efficiency analysis, and ablation studies, indicates methodological rigor. Minor areas needing further justification or empirical validation include the specific choice of layers for feature distillation/RAR and the precise effectiveness of the proposed RAR technique, but the overall approach is technically solid."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The reliance on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA) significantly reduces the computational burden compared to full fine-tuning or methods requiring extensive retraining, making it practical with standard research resources. The required components (foundation models, PEFT libraries, KD frameworks) are readily available. While the integration of multiple components (dual-teacher KD, shift simulation, RAR) introduces implementation complexity, and extensive hyperparameter tuning (\\alpha, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\beta_l, \\gamma_l, etc.) will be necessary, these are manageable engineering and experimental challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues. Access to the original foundation model weights is a prerequisite but generally achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the practical deployment of foundation models: the trade-off between task specialization and distributional robustness. This problem is central to the workshop's theme and has major implications for deploying AI reliably in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and autonomous systems. If successful, the proposed method could lead to substantially more robust fine-tuned models, enabling safer and more equitable AI applications. The potential for a modality-agnostic, computationally efficient solution further amplifies its significance. The expected contributions (method, insights, open-source resources) could have a broad impact on the research community and industry practice."
