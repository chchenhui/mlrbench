    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (focusing on 'Incorporating physical insights to AI methods' and 'Accelerating drug discovery pipeline'), the research idea (elaborating on physics-informed RL with MD surrogates), and the literature review (building upon existing RL, physics-informed ML, and MD integration works while addressing cited challenges like computational cost and reward design). It directly tackles the core problem outlined in the idea and positions itself clearly within the context provided by the literature."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. Objectives, methodology (including the generator, surrogate, RL agent, reward structure, and training algorithm), experimental design, and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for adaptive reward balancing (mentioning options but not a final choice) or specific GNN architecture details, but these do not significantly hinder understanding at the proposal stage."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts (GNNs, RL, MD simulations, surrogate modeling, adaptive rewards) in a specific configuration to address the physical plausibility gap in molecular generation. While individual components exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the combination of a lightweight MD surrogate for *real-time* feedback within an RL loop featuring *adaptive* reward balancing between chemical and physical properties presents a novel refinement over cited works. It's not entirely groundbreaking but offers a fresh approach to known challenges."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations (RL, GNNs, surrogate modeling, physics-informed principles). The methodology is logical, linking generation, physical validation via surrogate, and RL optimization. The use of PPO, MSE loss for the surrogate, and the structured reward function are appropriate. The justification for using a surrogate (efficiency) and adaptive rewards (balancing objectives) is strong. Potential challenges in surrogate accuracy and reward tuning are inherent but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. It requires significant expertise and computational resources for MD data generation, surrogate training, and RL optimization. The 12-month timeline is ambitious. Key risks include achieving sufficient surrogate accuracy and effectively tuning the adaptive reward mechanism. However, the core idea of using a surrogate model specifically mitigates the major feasibility bottleneck of running full MD simulations within the RL loop, making the overall plan plausible, albeit challenging."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses a critical bottleneck in computational drug discovery â€“ the generation of physically implausible molecules. By aiming to incorporate physical constraints (stability, binding energy) directly into the generative process via a computationally tractable surrogate, it has the potential to significantly reduce experimental attrition rates, save resources, and accelerate the hit-to-lead phase. Success would represent a substantial advancement in creating more realistic AI-driven scientific discovery tools."
