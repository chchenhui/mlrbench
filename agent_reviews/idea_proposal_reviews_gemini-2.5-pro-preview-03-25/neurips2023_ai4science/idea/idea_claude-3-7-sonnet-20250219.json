        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses two of the workshop's specifically mentioned interests: 'Scaling dynamical system modeling to millions of particles' and 'Incorporating physical insights to AI methods'. Furthermore, it fits well within the broader theme of AI/ML impacting scientific discovery and relates to example topics like 'Learning physical dynamics from data' and 'Speeding up physical simulators'. The motivation clearly connects the proposed research to fundamental challenges in scientific modeling."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation, problem statement, and proposed solution (PINNEs) are articulated concisely. The hierarchical structure (base, specialized, meta-networks), the role of differentiable physics modules, the use of ensembling for uncertainty, and the adaptive resolution strategy are explained logically. The core concepts are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and neural network ensembles are existing concepts, their combination into a hierarchical, orchestrated structure (PINNEs) specifically designed for large-scale dynamical systems with adaptive resolution is innovative. The specific architecture involving base, specialized, and meta-networks, along with the integration of differentiable physics modules within this ensemble framework, offers a fresh perspective on tackling the challenges of scale and physical consistency simultaneously."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training complex PINNs, especially with hard constraints, is non-trivial. Managing an ensemble of specialized networks coordinated by a meta-network adds layers of complexity in training stability and optimization. Designing effective differentiable physics modules requires deep domain expertise. Furthermore, achieving robust scaling to 'millions of particles' using adaptive resolution within this framework is ambitious and likely requires substantial computational resources and sophisticated engineering. While conceptually sound, practical implementation and achieving the claimed scale pose considerable hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully modeling complex dynamical systems at the scale of millions of particles while ensuring physical consistency would represent a major breakthrough. This capability could dramatically accelerate research in critical scientific domains like molecular dynamics, fluid simulations, and plasma physics, as mentioned. Overcoming the limitations of traditional simulators and purely data-driven methods could enable new discoveries and insights, fulfilling the workshop's goal of AI fundamentally impacting science."
