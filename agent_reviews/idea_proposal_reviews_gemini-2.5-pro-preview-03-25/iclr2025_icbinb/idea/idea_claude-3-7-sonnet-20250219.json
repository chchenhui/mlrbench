    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of the ICBINB workshop: understanding why deep learning fails in real-world applications. It focuses on healthcare, a domain explicitly mentioned in the call. The proposed analysis dimensions (dataset shifts, subgroup disparities, workflow integration, interpretability) align perfectly with the workshop's interest in failure modes and underlying reasons (data issues, model limitations, deployment challenges). The methodology (case studies, interviews, simulations) aims to provide the deep investigation into negative outcomes required by the task. It plans to deliver insights into failures and mitigation strategies, contributing valuable knowledge as sought by the workshop. While focused on one domain, this deep dive is encouraged and provides a concrete example fulfilling the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-articulated, highlighting the gap between benchmark performance and real-world healthcare outcomes. The main idea is clearly defined, outlining a systematic framework, specific analysis dimensions, a concrete methodology (case studies, interviews, simulations), and tangible expected outcomes (taxonomy, mitigation strategies, decision support tool). The scope (healthcare subdomains) is specified, and the overall research plan is logical and easy to understand with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While the problem of DL failures in healthcare is recognized, and individual failure modes (like dataset shift or bias) have been studied, the proposed approach offers innovation through its systematic, multi-dimensional framework specifically tailored to healthcare. Combining technical analysis (data shifts, performance) with socio-technical factors (workflow integration, clinician trust) and using mixed methods (retrospective analysis, interviews, simulations) provides a more holistic perspective than typical failure analyses. The development of a specific taxonomy of healthcare AI failure modes and a corresponding decision support tool represents a novel contribution to the field of applied AI in medicine."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces notable implementation challenges. The primary challenge lies in accessing detailed, high-quality data and context for *failed* AI deployments in healthcare. Organizations may be hesitant to share such sensitive information due to privacy, legal, or reputational concerns. Securing ethical approvals (IRB) and participation for interviews also requires significant effort. While retrospective analysis and simulations are standard techniques, their effectiveness depends heavily on the availability and quality of the initial data from the failed cases. Significant effort in building partnerships and navigating data access protocols will be required, making implementation non-trivial."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Failures of AI systems in healthcare can have severe consequences, including patient harm, misdiagnosis, and erosion of trust in technology. Understanding the root causes of these failures is critical for the safe and effective deployment of AI in clinical practice. The proposed research directly addresses this crucial problem. The potential outcomes – a taxonomy of failure modes, mitigation strategies, and a readiness assessment tool – could provide invaluable guidance to developers, clinicians, and healthcare institutions, leading to more robust, reliable, and trustworthy healthcare AI, thus having a major positive impact on the field and patient care."
