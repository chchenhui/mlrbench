    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the ICBINB workshop's call by focusing on real-world DL failures in a specific domain (healthcare), investigating underlying reasons (data shifts, bias, workflow, interpretability), and aiming to produce negative results insights. It fulfills the four required elements for submissions (use case via case studies, literature solutions, negative outcomes, investigation). The proposal systematically elaborates on the research idea, detailing the multi-dimensional framework. It also explicitly incorporates and builds upon the challenges identified in the literature review (underspecification, deployment issues, adversarial attacks)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. Objectives are broken down logically, and the multi-stage methodology (case study collection, analysis across four dimensions, simulation, evaluation, toolkit development) is presented with high detail and structure. Specific metrics, techniques, and even mathematical formulations are included, enhancing clarity. The rationale, significance, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and persuasively. The structure is logical and easy to follow, with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality and innovation. While analyzing DL failures is not entirely new, the synthesis of multiple failure dimensions (data, bias, workflow, interpretability, robustness) within a single, structured framework specifically for the complex healthcare domain is innovative. It moves beyond general surveys or purely theoretical analyses by grounding the work in extensive case studies and controlled simulations tailored to healthcare scenarios (radiology, pathology, etc.). Connecting theoretical concepts like underspecification directly to clinical deployment pitfalls and proposing a practical mitigation toolkit and benchmark represents a fresh contribution. The novelty is clearly articulated against existing literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations in ML (distribution shift, fairness, interpretability, adversarial robustness) and appropriately cites key literature. The proposed methodology employs well-established and suitable techniques (KL divergence, Wasserstein distance, fairness metrics like ED/ECE, SHAP, Grad-CAM, PGD attacks, domain adaptation). The combination of retrospective case analysis, quantitative metrics, controlled simulations, and human-centric evaluation (surveys, mock workflows) provides a robust approach. Technical formulations appear correct. Minor concerns might arise around the practical execution of collecting 50+ diverse case studies and the fidelity achievable in workflow simulations, but the overall research design is methodologically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges due to its ambitious scope. Collecting 50+ detailed case studies, particularly those involving sensitive failure information or requiring expert interviews across multiple healthcare subdomains, will be demanding in terms of time, access, and resources. Implementing and validating the human-in-the-loop workflow simulations accurately also requires considerable effort. While the individual technical components (running metrics, training models, using interpretability tools) are feasible with current technology, integrating all aspects across four dimensions, plus developing a toolkit and benchmarks, represents a very large undertaking for a single project. The primary risk lies in securing sufficient high-quality data/case studies and managing the breadth of the investigation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in translational AI: the gap between benchmark performance and real-world clinical utility, where failures can have severe consequences. By systematically identifying, categorizing, and providing mitigation strategies for healthcare-specific DL failures, the research has the potential to substantially improve the safety, reliability, fairness, and trustworthiness of medical AI systems. The development of a taxonomy, toolkit, and benchmarks would be a major contribution to both the ML research community (especially ICBINB) and healthcare practitioners/organizations aiming to deploy AI responsibly."
