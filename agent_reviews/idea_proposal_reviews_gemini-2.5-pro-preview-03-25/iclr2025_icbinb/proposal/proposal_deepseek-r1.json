    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the research idea, elaborating on it comprehensively. It strongly aligns with the literature review by incorporating identified challenges (distribution shift, bias, workflow integration, adversarial vulnerability, interpretability) into its core framework. It also aligns well with the task description's focus on analyzing real-world DL failures, understanding *why* they occur, and examining negative outcomes. The proposal structure mirrors the task's required elements (use case, literature solution implicitly, negative outcome, investigation). The only minor deviation from the task description is the primary focus on a single domain (healthcare), whereas the task encourages cross-domain insights, although the proposal does mention potential cross-domain applicability as a secondary outcome."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section is detailed, outlining specific data sources, the four dimensions of the analysis framework, concrete metrics (MMD, DI, EOD, SHAP), and experimental procedures (simulations, adversarial attacks) with relevant technical formulations. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan readily understandable. Minor details, like the exact integration of literature review findings into the framework beyond pattern identification, could be slightly more explicit, but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While the individual components (analyzing distribution shift, fairness, interpretability, etc.) are known concepts, the key innovation lies in synthesizing these into a systematic, multi-dimensional diagnostic framework specifically tailored for healthcare DL failures. This integrated approach, combining technical metrics with qualitative workflow and trust assessments for this high-stakes domain, distinguishes it from prior work that often focuses on isolated issues (as highlighted in the literature review). The development of a healthcare-specific failure taxonomy and a practical decision support tool are also novel contributions."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is methodologically sound and rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical concepts (distribution shift, fairness, adversarial examples, interpretability) and employs appropriate, well-accepted quantitative metrics (MMD, DI, EOD, SHAP) and qualitative methods (interviews, surveys). The inclusion of controlled simulations alongside retrospective case studies provides a robust approach to investigating failure modes. The technical formulations presented are standard and correctly applied in context. The reliance on partnerships for real-world data is noted, but the planned multi-faceted analysis (technical, qualitative, simulation) provides a strong foundation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant practical challenges. The technical aspects (implementing metrics, running simulations) are achievable with standard tools. However, the core data collection relies heavily on securing partnerships with three healthcare systems to obtain anonymized records of DL deployment failures. Accessing such sensitive data, even anonymized, along with detailed context about the failures, can be extremely difficult due to privacy regulations (HIPAA), institutional bureaucracy, and potential reluctance to share failure data. Conducting 30+ stakeholder interviews also requires significant coordination. While the plan is logical, the dependency on external data access introduces considerable risk to the project timeline and success."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the gap between DL potential and real-world performance in healthcare, where failures have serious consequences. By aiming to create a systematic framework for diagnosing these failures, developing mitigation strategies, and providing a decision tool, the research has the potential for major impact. It could improve the safety, reliability, fairness, and trustworthiness of medical AI, influence clinical practice and AI adoption strategies, and potentially inform regulatory guidelines. The focus on healthcare is critical, and the proposed outcomes (taxonomy, guidelines, tool) are substantial contributions."
