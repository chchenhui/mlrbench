    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly expands on the research idea and incorporates challenges identified in the literature (dataset shifts, workflow integration). It strongly aligns with the overall goal of the ICBINB task (understanding real-world DL failures). However, the task description primarily solicits specific case studies of failure ('a use case', 'a solution', 'negative outcome', 'investigation why'), whereas this proposal outlines a framework to analyze *multiple* such cases and build a taxonomy/tool. While highly relevant to the workshop's theme, it's structured as a research project proposal rather than a single failure analysis paper as described for submissions. The focus on healthcare is appropriate given the task's call for domain-specific applications."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. The background, objectives, methodology (broken into stages), and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The multi-dimensional assessment framework is defined. A minor point of ambiguity lies in Section 3's 'Evaluation Metrics', which describes criteria for evaluating the research project itself (rigor, novelty, etc.) rather than metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed framework, taxonomy, or decision support tool in practice. Overall, the proposal communicates its intentions effectively."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While studying ML/DL failures isn't entirely new (as shown by the task and literature), the specific focus on creating a systematic, multi-dimensional framework (combining technical, demographic, workflow, and interpretability aspects) tailored *specifically* for healthcare DL failures is innovative. Developing a taxonomy and a decision support tool based on this analysis represents a novel contribution beyond simply cataloging failures. It synthesizes existing concerns (like those in the literature review) into a structured approach for a specific high-impact domain, offering fresh perspectives compared to general surveys or analyses of single failure types."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, grounded in recognized challenges (underspecification, distribution shift, workflow issues) identified in the literature. The mixed-methods approach (case studies, interviews, simulations) is appropriate. However, there are gaps in rigor: 1) Potential for bias in case study selection and reliance on potentially incomplete published data or interview recall. Methods for ensuring case study quality/completeness are not detailed. 2) Reproducing complex failures via simulation is challenging; validation strategies for simulation fidelity are missing. 3) The process for developing and validating the taxonomy and decision support tool lacks detail. 4) The 'Evaluation Metrics' section focuses on assessing the research process itself, not the validity or utility of the outputs (taxonomy, tool). More detail on validation and bias mitigation is needed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Accessing detailed, reliable information on *failed* healthcare AI projects (case studies) can be very difficult due to confidentiality and reporting biases. Securing interviews with key stakeholders might also be challenging. Reproducing complex, real-world failure conditions (especially those involving human factors like workflow integration or trust) in controlled simulations is technically demanding and may lack fidelity. Building and validating a comprehensive taxonomy and a useful decision support tool is a substantial undertaking requiring significant resources (time, expertise, potentially data access) which are not specified. The overall ambition level presents considerable practical hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the gap between DL potential and real-world performance in healthcare, where failures can have severe consequences for patient safety and outcomes. Understanding and mitigating these failures is crucial for the responsible adoption of AI in medicine. The development of a structured taxonomy and a practical decision support tool has the potential to provide substantial value to healthcare organizations, researchers, and developers, leading to more reliable AI systems and improved patient care. It strongly aligns with the need for transparency and learning from failures emphasized by the ICBINB initiative."
