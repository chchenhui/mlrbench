    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for 'Scalable Cultural Representation Evaluations' as a key theme, and the 'Geo-Cultural Probes' idea directly proposes a framework to address this need. It focuses on testing cross-cultural performance, identifying cultural gaps and biases, and creating metrics for representation and alignment, all of which are central goals mentioned in the workshop description for building globally inclusive AI."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It defines the core concept ('Geo-Cultural Probes'), outlines the methodology (targeted prompts based on cultural frameworks/experts, hybrid evaluation), and states the objective (quantifiable benchmark, identifying biases). While the overall concept is understandable, specific details regarding the exact nature of the probes, the implementation of automated metrics for cultural nuance, and the precise setup of scalable human evaluation could benefit from further elaboration."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While AI evaluation for fairness exists, the specific approach of creating 'Geo-Cultural Probes' systematically derived from established cross-cultural psychology frameworks (like Hofstede's dimensions) combined with localized expert knowledge is innovative. The proposed hybrid evaluation method, integrating automated analysis with scalable, culturally-focused human judgment (like TURING test variations for cultural appropriateness), offers a fresh perspective compared to standard bias detection methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. Developing probes based on existing frameworks and expert input is achievable. Implementing automated metrics is possible using current NLP techniques, although accurately capturing subtle cultural nuances automatically will be difficult. The main challenge lies in the 'scalable human evaluation' component â€“ ensuring the cultural competence, consistency, and scalability of human evaluators across diverse cultural contexts requires significant logistical effort, careful design, and potentially high costs. Access to various AI models for probing is also necessary."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. As highlighted in the task description, developing methods to evaluate and ensure cultural inclusivity in AI is a critical, yet underdeveloped, area. This proposal addresses a major gap by offering a systematic and potentially scalable framework. If successful, it could provide invaluable tools for developers to identify and mitigate cultural biases, leading to more equitable and globally accepted AI systems. Creating a quantifiable benchmark would be a major contribution to the field."
