    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core research idea of 'Human-AI Co-Adaptation Loops'. It fits perfectly within the workshop's scope, particularly the themes of 'Developer Productivity and HCI for Code' (adaptation to user needs, human-AI interaction) and 'Post-training and Alignment for Code' (learning from human feedback). The proposal explicitly references relevant papers from the literature review (Liu et al., Dai et al., Zhao et al.) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified (personalization, interaction, real-time adaptation, evaluation, privacy). It also touches upon 'Responsible AI' by emphasizing privacy preservation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the research question. The methodology is logically structured into data collection, algorithms, and evaluation. Each section provides significant detail, including specific feedback types, algorithmic approaches (MAML, Contextual Bandits, Memory Networks) with mathematical formulations, and a comprehensive multi-phase evaluation plan with clearly defined metrics. The conceptual plugin architecture diagram further enhances clarity. The objectives, methods, and rationale are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While personalization in code assistants exists (as noted in the literature review, e.g., MPCODER), the core concept of a *bidirectional* 'human-AI co-adaptation loop' focusing on continuous mutual learning in real-time is a fresh perspective. The integration of multi-modal feedback (explicit and implicit) and the specific combination of advanced ML techniques (MAML for fast adaptation, contextual bandits for exploration, memory networks for long-term trends) applied to this problem represents a novel methodological contribution. The proposal clearly distinguishes its approach from existing work like proactive assistants (CodingGenie) or style representation learning (MPCODER)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations, leveraging established ML techniques like meta-learning (MAML), reinforcement learning (contextual bandits), and memory-augmented networks appropriately for the problem of online personalization. The proposed methodology, including multi-modal feedback collection and a multi-phase evaluation (lab, field, ablation) with specific metrics, is robust and well-justified. Technical formulations are provided for key algorithmic components. Minor weaknesses include the lack of detailed specification for privacy-preserving techniques (though mentioned) and the inherent complexity of ensuring stability and convergence for the combined online learning system, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Developing robust IDE plugins for rich, multi-modal data collection across multiple platforms is complex. Integrating and optimizing several advanced online learning algorithms (MAML, bandits, memory networks) to work seamlessly in real-time requires significant engineering effort and expertise. Ensuring user privacy with local processing and techniques like differential privacy adds another layer of complexity. Furthermore, the planned evaluation is ambitious, requiring recruitment and management of a large number of participants (50 lab, 100 field for 12 weeks) and associated infrastructure. While conceptually sound, the practical execution faces substantial hurdles and risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in AI-assisted software development: the static nature of current code assistants and their inability to deeply adapt to individual users. Successfully developing a co-adaptive system could lead to major advancements in developer productivity, code quality, user satisfaction, and trust in AI tools. The expected contributions (novel framework, algorithms, open-source tools, empirical insights, design guidelines) are substantial. The research also has broader implications for human-AI interaction design, personalized education, and responsible AI development, aligning well with important research trends."
