    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses multiple key themes of the DL4C workshop call (agentic methods, post-training/alignment via human/execution feedback, developer productivity/HCI, open science, benchmarking). The methodology and objectives are a direct and logical expansion of the research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature, positioning the work effectively and tackling the identified challenges (personalization, real-time adaptation, HCI, evaluation, privacy)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology is broken down into logical, detailed components (Data Collection, Architecture, Algorithms, Evaluation). Technical concepts like LoRA, meta-learning, and DP-SGD are explained with relevant formulations and pseudocode. The evaluation plan is specific and comprehensive. While minor details like the exact formulation of the meta-objective could be slightly more explicit, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing techniques (LLMs for code, LoRA, online learning, meta-learning, multi-modal feedback, DP-SGD) into a novel 'human-AI co-adaptation loop' framework specifically for code assistants. While the individual components are not entirely new, their combination to enable real-time, privacy-preserving personalization driven by diverse in-situ feedback and user controls represents a fresh and innovative approach compared to the cited literature, which often focuses on offline methods or less dynamic adaptation. The emphasis on *co-adaptation* and the specific system design is novel."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations in deep learning for code, online learning, meta-learning, and HCI. The proposed methodology (IDE plugin, LoRA adaptation, meta-learning structure, DP-SGD for privacy, reward modeling) employs well-established and appropriate techniques. Technical formulations are presented correctly. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including standard benchmarks, a well-designed user study with appropriate metrics (correctness, time, SUS, NASA-TLX), statistical analysis, and ablation studies, demonstrating methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Building IDE plugins, implementing LoRA, meta-learning, and DP-SGD are achievable tasks for a skilled research team. Access to pre-trained models is common. The user study (N=60) is ambitious but feasible within a research project context. Potential challenges lie in the real-time performance constraints of the adaptation loop, the complexity of integrating all components seamlessly, and potentially the computational cost of frequent updates or meta-learning. However, the plan is generally realistic with manageable risks, assuming adequate resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of personalization and adaptability in current AI code assistants, which hinders developer productivity and effective human-AI collaboration. Successfully implementing the co-adaptation loop could lead to major advancements in AI-powered developer tools. The research has strong potential impact on multiple fronts: advancing ML techniques for code personalization, improving developer productivity/HCI, contributing to model alignment research, establishing new benchmarks, and promoting open science and responsible AI practices (via DP and open-sourcing). It aligns perfectly with critical areas of interest in the DL4C community."
