        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (DL4C workshop call for papers). It directly addresses multiple specifically welcomed submission areas: 'Agentic Methods for Programming Tasks' by aiming to solve realistic GitHub issues, 'Post-training and Alignment for Code' through its use of human feedback via Inverse RL for alignment, and 'Developer Productivity and HCI for Code' by focusing on human-AI collaboration, interactive feedback, and reducing developer effort. It also touches upon 'Benchmarking and Evaluation' by proposing evaluation on realistic tasks. The idea fits squarely within the workshop's theme of emergent possibilities and challenges in deep learning for code."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (RL, HITL, IRL, decomposition, sandbox, querying, explainability), evaluation plan (datasets, metrics), and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The concept of an agent querying developers at critical points and using IRL for alignment is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact mechanism of the lightweight interface, the specifics of task decomposition, and how IRL will handle potentially sparse or noisy human feedback in real-time, but the overall research direction is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While RL for code and human-in-the-loop systems exist, the proposed integration of interactive feedback *during* complex task execution using Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to dynamically align the agent's policy with developer preferences at critical decision points appears novel. Combining this with task decomposition, sandboxed execution, and explainability features presents a fresh perspective on building collaborative coding agents, moving beyond static RLHF or simple prompting strategies."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Key components like RL agents for code, sandboxed environments, and basic HITL interfaces are achievable with current technology. However, effectively implementing IRL based on potentially sparse or inconsistent human feedback gathered interactively poses a research challenge. Designing robust task decomposition, identifying 'critical decision points' automatically, and conducting meaningful human studies to evaluate developer effort require significant effort and careful experimental design. Accessing and processing realistic GitHub issues is feasible. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable within a dedicated research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in current code generation AI: the inability to handle complex, multi-step programming tasks collaboratively and adaptively. Improving the ability of AI agents to solve realistic tasks like GitHub issues while aligning with developer intent could lead to major advancements in developer productivity and software engineering practices. The focus on trust, explainability, and human-AI co-creation tackles important HCI challenges in the adoption of AI tools, potentially leading to more effective and accepted coding assistants."
