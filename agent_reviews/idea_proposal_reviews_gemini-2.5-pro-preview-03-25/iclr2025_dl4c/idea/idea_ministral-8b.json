        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (DL4C workshop call). It directly addresses several specifically welcomed submission topics: 'Developer Productivity and HCI for Code' (main focus), 'Post-training and Alignment for Code' (incorporating real-time developer feedback), 'Benchmarking and Evaluation for Code' (using execution-based benchmarks and considering project context), and 'Open Science and Responsible AI for Code' (explicit mention of open science approach). The overall theme of enhancing code generation models fits squarely within 'Deep Learning for Code'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main goal (context-aware code generation), proposed approach (multi-modal model using style, requirements, feedback), and evaluation strategy (benchmarks, human-in-the-loop) are well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific nature of 'behavioral data' and the exact deep learning architecture, but the core concept is easily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While context-aware code generation is an existing research direction, the proposed approach combines multiple context sources (style, project requirements, real-time feedback) and data modalities (textual, structural, behavioral) in a potentially novel way. Integrating real-time developer feedback and specifically fusing behavioral data alongside textual and structural information offers fresh perspectives compared to standard context-aware models that primarily rely on surrounding code."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology. Deep learning for code is mature. Collecting static context (style, requirements) is possible. However, integrating real-time developer feedback poses moderate implementation challenges (requires robust human-in-the-loop infrastructure). Fusing multi-modal data (especially behavioral) can be complex. Evaluation via human studies is resource-intensive. Accessing or creating datasets that capture all these contextual elements might require significant effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Enhancing developer productivity is a crucial goal in software engineering. Addressing the lack of contextual awareness in current code generation models targets a well-recognized limitation. Success could lead to more effective AI coding assistants, reducing developer cognitive load, improving code quality, and potentially accelerating software development cycles. The commitment to open science further enhances its potential impact."
