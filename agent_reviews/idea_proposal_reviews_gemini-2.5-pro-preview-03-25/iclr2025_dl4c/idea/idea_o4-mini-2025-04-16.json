        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea 'AlignCode' perfectly aligns with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on 'Post-training and Alignment for Code', specifically mentioning learning from 'human feedback, execution feedback, and AI feedback'. The AlignCode proposal directly addresses this by outlining a multi-stage post-training pipeline incorporating these exact three feedback types (human ratings, unit tests/execution, AI critic) to improve code generation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It presents a distinct three-stage pipeline (Human Feedback Tuning, Execution Feedback Loop, AI Critic Alignment) with a clear motivation (improving correctness, security, style) and evaluation plan. The core concepts are understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details of the AI critic, the exact method for combining potentially conflicting feedback signals across stages, and the precise nature of the 'SecurityEval' benchmark, but these are details expected in a full paper rather than a summary idea."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like RLHF, execution-based feedback (e.g., AlphaCode's approach), and AI critics exist in prior work, the novelty lies in proposing a unified, multi-stage framework that systematically integrates all three feedback sources (human, execution, AI) specifically for code generation alignment. Targeting correctness, security, and style simultaneously within this structured pipeline, and proposing a new security-focused benchmark ('SecurityEval'), adds to its innovative aspect. It's more of a novel synthesis and application than a fundamentally new technique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Each stage relies on established techniques: fine-tuning with human preference data, reinforcement learning with execution-based rewards, and using model-based critics with policy gradients. Datasets like HumanEval/MBPP exist for execution feedback, and curating human feedback or security data, while resource-intensive, is achievable. Training large code models and critics is computationally demanding but standard practice. The main challenges lie in the engineering effort required for integration, balancing the different feedback signals, and curating the necessary datasets, but these seem surmountable with current technology and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Improving the reliability, security, and stylistic consistency of code generated by large models is a critical challenge in the field. Current models often produce flawed code, hindering developer trust and productivity. Successfully implementing AlignCode could lead to substantially more trustworthy code generation tools, directly impacting developer workflows and software quality. Addressing correctness, security, and style through diverse feedback mechanisms tackles key limitations of existing models. The proposed 'SecurityEval' benchmark could also become a valuable community resource."
