    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the need for interpretable ML in healthcare by proposing a method (ProtoCast) that uses structured knowledge (medical knowledge graphs) to generate prototype-based explanations, aiming to align with clinical reasoning, enhance trust, and potentially mitigate bias. This fits squarely within the workshop's scope and explicitly touches upon key topics like 'Graph reasoning in healthcare', 'Developing interpretable ML methods aligned with clinical reasoning', 'Embedding medical knowledge in ML systems', and 'Application of interpretation methods to disease understanding'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, core mechanism (KG construction, contrastive prototype distillation, GNN encoder, similarity-based prediction, prototype explanation), and evaluation plan (accuracy, interpretability comparison, physician surveys) are articulated concisely and logically. Minor technical details (e.g., specifics of the contrastive learning objective, patient data encoding) could be further elaborated, but the overall concept and approach are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like GNNs, KGs in healthcare, and prototype-based learning exist, the specific combination is innovative. Using contrastive graph representation learning to explicitly distill *subgraph prototypes* from a medical KG and then using these graph-based prototypes as an interpretable latent space for patient data encoded by a GNN appears to be a fresh approach. It moves beyond standard node/link prediction on KGs or feature-based prototypes, grounding explanations in clinically relevant graph structures."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Constructing a large-scale KG from UMLS and EHR data is feasible but requires significant data engineering and access. Contrastive learning on graphs and GNNs are established techniques, but developing methods to specifically distill meaningful subgraph prototypes contrastively might require research effort. Mapping potentially heterogeneous patient EHR data via a GNN into this prototype space needs careful design. Access to EHR data and clinician time for surveys are significant practical hurdles. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the 'black-box' problem and lack of trust in clinical AI is critical for its safe and effective deployment in healthcare, a high-stakes domain. By providing explanations grounded in clinically recognizable knowledge graph structures (prototypes), the method has the potential to significantly improve model transparency, physician trust, bias detection, and alignment with clinical reasoning. Success could lead to major advancements in interpretable and trustworthy medical AI."
