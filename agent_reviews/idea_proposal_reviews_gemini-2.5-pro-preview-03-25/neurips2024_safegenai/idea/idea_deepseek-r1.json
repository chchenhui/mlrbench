        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses one of the key topics listed in the task description: 'Overconfidence in the reliability of generated content'. It focuses on generative models and their safety implications, particularly the risks associated with uncalibrated confidence in high-stakes domains, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's theme of Safe Generative AI."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly. The motivation (overconfidence risk), the proposed method (uncertainty-aware RL integrating UQ into rewards), specific examples (Bayesian dropout, ensembles), evaluation strategy (quality and calibration metrics like ECE), and expected outcomes (models signaling uncertainty, safer collaboration) are all well-defined and articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While uncertainty quantification (UQ) and reinforcement learning (RL) are established fields, the specific proposal to integrate UQ metrics directly into the RL reward function for the explicit purpose of calibrating generative model confidence offers notable originality. It's a novel combination and application of existing techniques tailored to a specific safety problem (overconfidence), rather than just improving general performance. Applying this across multiple modalities adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is largely feasible using current technology. RL training for large models is standard (e.g., RLHF), and UQ methods like ensembles or MC dropout are well-understood and implementable, albeit potentially computationally intensive. Integrating UQ into rewards is technically achievable. Evaluating calibration is standard. The main challenges are the computational resources required and potentially complex tuning of the combined RL+UQ system, but these are engineering challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a critical and widely recognized safety issue in generative AI: overconfidence, which undermines trust and can lead to harmful outcomes in sensitive applications. Developing models that are better calibrated and can reliably signal their uncertainty would be a major advancement for safe AI deployment. The potential impact on enabling safer human-AI interaction and building trust in AI systems is very high."
