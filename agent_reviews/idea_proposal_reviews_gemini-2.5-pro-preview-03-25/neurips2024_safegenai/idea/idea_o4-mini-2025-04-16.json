        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses key topics outlined in the workshop description, specifically 'Vulnerability to adversarial attacks' and 'Limited robustness' in generative models. The motivation explicitly links the need for certified robustness to the safe deployment of these models, aligning perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on AI safety concerns related to generative AI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. It clearly defines the problem (adversarial vulnerability in conditional generative models), the proposed solution (extending randomized smoothing), the core mechanism (noisy sampling, aggregation, theoretical certificates via Wasserstein shift), and methods to mitigate drawbacks (adaptive noise, calibration). The evaluation plan is also mentioned, making the research direction unambiguous and easy to understand."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While randomized smoothing is an existing technique, its extension to conditional generative models, particularly with theoretical certificates based on Wasserstein distance shifts in the output distribution, represents a notable advancement. Applying it specifically for certified robustness against conditioning input perturbations in high-dimensional generative tasks offers a fresh perspective compared to standard classification robustness or empirical defenses for generative models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Randomized smoothing inherently requires multiple forward passes of the base model per input, leading to significant computational overhead, especially for large-scale generative models like diffusion models or LLMs. Aggregating outputs from a generative model ensemble (potentially complex distributions or high-dimensional data like images) and effectively calibrating noise to maintain generation quality while achieving meaningful robustness radii are non-trivial technical hurdles. While theoretically sound, practical implementation requires careful engineering and potentially substantial computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Adversarial robustness is a critical safety concern for generative AI, hindering trustworthy deployment. Providing *certified* robustness, rather than just empirical defense, offers formal guarantees, which is a major step forward. Success in this area could substantially increase the reliability and safety of generative models in sensitive applications (e.g., medical, legal), directly addressing the core concerns of the Safe Generative AI workshop and potentially having a major impact on the field."
