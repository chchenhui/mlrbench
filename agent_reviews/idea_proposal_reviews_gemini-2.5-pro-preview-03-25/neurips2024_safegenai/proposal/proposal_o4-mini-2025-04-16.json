    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the 'Safe Generative AI Workshop' by focusing on the vulnerability of generative models to adversarial attacks and proposing a method for certified robustness. The proposal meticulously expands on the 'SmoothGen' research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it effectively utilizes the literature review to position itself, acknowledging prior work on randomized smoothing for classifiers and simpler generative models (GANs, RNNs), identifying the gap concerning modern high-dimensional models (diffusion, LLMs), and explicitly aiming to address the key challenges highlighted in the review (extension to high-dim models, robustness-quality trade-off, adaptive noise, theoretical guarantees)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, problem statement, and research objectives are articulated concisely and without ambiguity. The methodology section provides a clear mathematical formulation, a comprehensible algorithm sketch (SmoothGen_Sample), and well-described concepts for adaptive noise calibration. The experimental design is detailed and logically structured, specifying models, datasets, baselines, metrics, and evaluation protocol. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow, making the proposal readily understandable to an expert audience."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While randomized smoothing is an established technique for classifiers, its extension to modern, high-dimensional conditional generative models like diffusion models and large autoregressive language models is a novel and non-trivial contribution. The proposal further introduces specific novel elements: deriving theoretical certificates based on the Wasserstein distance shift for these complex output distributions, and proposing adaptive noise calibration techniques (gradient-based and diffusion-specific schedules) to balance robustness and fidelity. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work focused on classifiers or simpler generative models (GANs/RNNs), addressing a recognized gap in the literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon the solid theoretical foundation of randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019). The proposed extension to generative models using Wasserstein distance certificates is theoretically plausible, relying on a standard (though potentially strong) Lipschitz continuity assumption for the generator mapping. The mathematical sketch provided for the certificate derivation appears correct. The proposed Monte Carlo algorithm is standard, and the adaptive noise strategies are sensible approaches. The experimental design is comprehensive and rigorous, including appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Estimating the Lipschitz constant via spectral norms is a standard but potentially challenging technique that might yield loose bounds, which is a minor weakness in practical application but methodologically sound."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. Access to pre-trained models and significant computational resources (multi-GPU clusters) is required, which is standard but necessary. Key challenges include the computational cost of Monte Carlo sampling (requiring potentially hundreds of forward passes per input) and the difficulty in obtaining tight estimates for the Lipschitz constant L for large, complex models like Stable Diffusion or GPT-2. Achieving a favorable trade-off between the certified robustness radius and the perceptual quality/fidelity of the generated outputs using the proposed adaptive noise methods will require careful tuning and experimentation. The plan is realistic, but the computational overhead and the tightness of the achievable certificates are moderate risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in AI safety: the adversarial vulnerability of widely used generative models. Providing the first framework for *certified* robustness for state-of-the-art diffusion models and LLMs would be a major advancement. Success would significantly enhance trust and potentially enable the safer deployment of these powerful models in high-stakes applications (e.g., healthcare, legal tech), directly contributing to the goals of the Safe Generative AI field. The theoretical contributions regarding distributional certificates and adaptive smoothing could also spur further research in robust generative modeling."
