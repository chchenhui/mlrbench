        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Safe Generative AI workshop themes like adversarial vulnerability), the research idea (SmoothGen concept), and the literature review (building upon randomized smoothing foundations and acknowledging prior work on GANs/RNNs). It clearly identifies the gap – certifying modern high-dimensional models like diffusion and LLMs – and tailors the objectives and methodology accordingly. It directly addresses the challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as the robustness-fidelity trade-off and the need for generative-specific theoretical guarantees."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, problem statement, objectives, methodology, and expected impact are articulated concisely and logically. Key concepts like randomized smoothing, conditioning inputs, embedding spaces, and Wasserstein distance are used appropriately. The mathematical formulation and algorithmic steps provide a clear picture of the proposed approach. The experimental design is detailed and unambiguous. While the derivation of the Wasserstein bound is presented as a goal rather than a completed proof (as expected in a proposal), the overall plan is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While randomized smoothing is an established technique, and prior work applied it to simpler generative models (GANs, RNNs), this proposal targets its extension to state-of-the-art, high-dimensional conditional generative models (diffusion, LLMs). Key novel aspects include: 1) Focusing on certifying the Wasserstein distance between output distributions, a more suitable metric for generative tasks than classification accuracy. 2) Proposing specific techniques (adaptive noise, gradient-based calibration) to manage the robustness-fidelity trade-off in these complex models. 3) Aiming for a general framework applicable across different modern architectures. It's a significant, non-trivial extension of existing ideas to a challenging and impactful domain."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon the theoretically solid foundation of randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019). The proposed extension to conditional generative models using Wasserstein distance is logical, although deriving tight and meaningful bounds is acknowledged as a key challenge and represents the main theoretical hurdle. The methodology, including noise injection in embedding spaces and the proposed optimization techniques, is well-reasoned. The experimental plan is comprehensive and uses appropriate metrics and baselines. Minor uncertainties exist regarding the tightness of achievable bounds and the practical effectiveness of the aggregation/selection strategies, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with standard ML research resources (compute, access to models/datasets). Implementing the core smoothing mechanism is technically achievable within existing frameworks. The main challenges lie in the theoretical derivation of tight bounds and managing the computational cost associated with Monte Carlo sampling (requiring N forward passes per smoothed output), which is inherent to randomized smoothing but potentially demanding for large models. The proposed optimization for the robustness-fidelity trade-off also requires careful experimentation. However, these are considered research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks, making the overall plan realistic."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses a critical AI safety concern – the adversarial vulnerability of widely used generative models – which is central to the workshop's theme. Providing *certified* robustness guarantees, rather than just empirical defenses, would be a major advancement for deploying these models safely in high-stakes applications. Success would enhance trustworthiness, contribute fundamentally to robust ML theory by extending smoothing to generative distributional outputs, and provide valuable tools for the AI safety community. The potential impact on the field is substantial."
