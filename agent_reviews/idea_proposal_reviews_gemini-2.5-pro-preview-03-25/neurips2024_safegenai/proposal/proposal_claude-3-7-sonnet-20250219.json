        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core concern of the workshop task (vulnerability of generative models to adversarial attacks) and elaborates precisely on the research idea (extending randomized smoothing for certified robustness). It effectively synthesizes the literature review, positioning SmoothGen as a solution to the identified challenges (extending smoothing to high-dim generative models, balancing robustness/quality, adaptive noise, generative guarantees) and building upon existing work (Cohen et al., Zhang et al.). The objectives and methodology are fully consistent with the stated problem and prior art."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from introduction and motivation to methodology and expected impact. Key concepts like randomized smoothing for generative models, the SmoothGen framework, and the theoretical certificates (Theorems 1 & 2) are explained well. The methodology section details the approach, including adaptive noise calibration and implementation specifics for different architectures. The experimental design is comprehensive. Minor ambiguities exist in the exact implementation details of aggregation methods (e.g., 'optimal transport-based blending') and the sensitivity function f(x), but these do not significantly hinder understanding the core proposal. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While randomized smoothing itself is an established technique for classifiers (Cohen et al.) and has seen extensions (Zhang et al. on GANs/RNNs), its application to modern, high-dimensional *conditional* generative models like large-scale diffusion models and LLMs is a novel and timely contribution. The specific proposal to derive certificates based on Wasserstein distance for output distributions (Theorem 1) and the introduction of adaptive noise calibration techniques (sensitivity-based scheduling, gradient-based latent space calibration) tailored for generative models represent innovative elements addressing key challenges. It's a significant extension rather than a completely new paradigm, but the novelty within the context of generative model safety is clear."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, grounded in the established theory of randomized smoothing. The extension to conditional generative models is theoretically plausible. The proposed theorems appear reasonable, although proving them rigorously and obtaining tight bounds (especially involving Lipschitz constants or Jacobians for complex models) will be challenging. The adaptive noise calibration methods are conceptually sound but require careful implementation and validation. Potential weaknesses lie in the practical estimation/bounding of Lipschitz constants, the computational cost of Jacobians, and the effectiveness of output aggregation methods without degrading quality significantly. However, the overall approach is methodologically coherent and builds logically on prior work."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical and computational challenges. Implementing randomized smoothing requires multiple forward passes per input, increasing computational cost, especially for large models. Calculating Jacobians for gradient-based calibration can be demanding. Access to large pre-trained models and substantial compute resources is necessary. Evaluating robustness against adaptive attacks is complex. However, the core techniques are implementable with current ML frameworks (PyTorch mentioned). The plan is ambitious but realistic for a well-equipped research team. The proposal acknowledges computational overhead, indicating awareness of practical constraints. Success hinges on managing computational costs and effectively implementing the adaptive/aggregation components."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and urgent problem in AI safety: the lack of provable robustness guarantees for powerful conditional generative models. Success would represent a major advancement in trustworthy AI, enabling safer deployment of these models in high-stakes applications (healthcare, legal). Providing the first certified robustness framework for models like diffusion systems and LLMs would be a landmark contribution. It directly tackles concerns about harmful content generation and adversarial manipulation, aligning perfectly with the goals of the Safe Generative AI workshop. The potential impact on research, industry standards, and AI safety is substantial."
