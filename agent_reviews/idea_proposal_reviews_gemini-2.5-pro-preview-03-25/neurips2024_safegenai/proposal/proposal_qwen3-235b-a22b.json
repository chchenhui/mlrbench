        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (Safe Generative AI Workshop focusing on adversarial vulnerability), the research idea (SmoothGen extending RS for certified robustness), and the literature review (building upon RS foundations and addressing limitations of prior work on generative models). It directly tackles the workshop's theme of adversarial attacks on generative models and proposes a solution based on the outlined idea, explicitly referencing and aiming to overcome challenges identified in the literature (scalability, quality trade-off, adaptive noise, theoretical guarantees)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, background, methodology (RS formulation, adaptive noise, experimental setup), and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The structure is coherent. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise details of aggregating outputs across different model types (diffusion vs. LLMs) and the full derivation of the Wasserstein certificate, but these do not significantly hinder the overall comprehension of the proposed work."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While randomized smoothing is an established technique and its application to generative models has been initiated (Ref 7, 10), this proposal introduces several novel elements: 1) Targeting high-dimensional, state-of-the-art conditional models like diffusion and LLMs, which poses unique challenges. 2) Proposing an adaptive noise calibration mechanism based on gradient sensitivity to balance robustness and fidelity, moving beyond fixed noise schedules. 3) Focusing on deriving Wasserstein stability certificates, offering a potentially more suitable metric for generative model outputs than classification accuracy. The combination of these elements represents a fresh and innovative approach in the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon the established theoretical foundation of randomized smoothing. The methodology extends these principles logically to conditional generative models. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics, and implementation details. However, the derivation of the Wasserstein certificate is presented briefly and relies on the Lipschitz constant (γ) of the base generator, which can be difficult to estimate or bound tightly for complex models like LLMs or diffusion models, potentially limiting the tightness or practicality of the certificate. The effectiveness of the proposed gradient-based adaptive noise mechanism is plausible but requires empirical validation for stability and performance."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with appropriate resources (significant compute for large models and RS sampling, access to benchmark datasets). The core techniques (RS, gradient computation) are implementable. However, challenges exist: 1) The computational cost of randomized smoothing (N=100 samples per input) is substantial, potentially limiting practical application or large-scale experiments, as acknowledged. 2) Achieving the ambitious target of high certified radii (≥80%) with minimal quality degradation (FID < 20, ≥95% CLIP score) might be difficult. 3) The adaptive noise mechanism needs careful tuning and validation. Overall, it's feasible for a well-equipped research setting but carries non-trivial implementation and performance risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in AI safety: the lack of verifiable robustness guarantees for powerful conditional generative models. Providing certified robustness against adversarial attacks would be a major advancement, enabling safer deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal tech, as highlighted. Successfully developing SmoothGen would make substantial technical contributions (first certified framework for high-dim generation, adaptive smoothing, theoretical advances) and have considerable positive societal impact by increasing trust in generative AI."
