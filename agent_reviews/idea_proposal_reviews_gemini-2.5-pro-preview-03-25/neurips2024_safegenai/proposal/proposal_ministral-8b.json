        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on AI safety concerns in generative models, specifically the vulnerability to adversarial attacks. The proposal meticulously follows the research idea, elaborating on the SmoothGen concept. It effectively situates itself within the provided literature, leveraging randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) and acknowledging related work (e.g., Zhang et al., 2021 on GANs), while explicitly aiming to tackle the key challenges identified in the review, such as extending to high-dimensional models and balancing robustness with quality."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, background, and significance are clearly stated. The core methodology of applying randomized smoothing is understandable, and the algorithmic steps provide a basic structure. However, some technical details lack sufficient clarity. The output aggregation method (simple averaging) is likely unsuitable for complex generative outputs like images or text and needs refinement. The mechanism for 'adaptive noise calibration' (gradient-based) is mentioned but not explained. The derivation of Wasserstein bounds is stated as a goal but lacks specifics. While generally well-structured, these ambiguities slightly detract from perfect clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building directly on established randomized smoothing techniques (Cohen et al., 2019; 2020) and related work on GANs (Zhang et al., 2021), it applies these concepts to a broader and highly relevant class of modern conditional generative models (diffusion, LLMs, V-LMs), focusing specifically on perturbations to the conditioning input. The proposed extensions, such as adaptive noise calibration for quality preservation and the use of Wasserstein distance for certification in this context, represent fresh contributions. The claim of being the 'first framework' might be slightly strong given prior work, but the specific focus and targeted model classes offer significant novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal's foundation on randomized smoothing is sound. However, there are significant weaknesses in the proposed methodology as described. The output aggregation step (`hat{y} = (1/n) * sum(y_i)`) is technically unsound for most high-dimensional generative outputs (e.g., averaging images leads to blur, averaging text sequences is ill-defined) and requires a fundamentally different approach. The proposal acknowledges the challenge of deriving theoretical guarantees (Wasserstein bounds) but doesn't outline *how* this complex derivation will be achieved for generative models. The adaptive noise calibration mechanism lacks sufficient detail to assess its soundness. These methodological gaps, particularly the aggregation method, weaken the overall soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core randomized smoothing loop is implementable, but requires substantial computational resources (n forward passes per input), potentially becoming prohibitive for large models like LLMs or diffusion models, as acknowledged. Developing a sound and effective output aggregation method (beyond simple averaging) is a major research hurdle. Similarly, designing and implementing effective adaptive noise calibration and deriving tight, meaningful Wasserstein bounds are non-trivial research tasks. While benchmark dataset experiments are feasible, scaling to large models and achieving practical robustness without excessive quality degradation or computational cost presents considerable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the adversarial vulnerability of conditional generative models. Ensuring the robustness of these widely used models (diffusion, LLMs) against attacks targeting their conditioning inputs is critical for AI safety and trustworthy deployment, especially in sensitive applications mentioned (medical, legal). Successfully developing a method for *certified* robustness in this domain would be a major advancement, directly contributing to the goals of the Safe Generative AI workshop and the broader field of AI safety. The potential impact on both research and practical applications is substantial."
