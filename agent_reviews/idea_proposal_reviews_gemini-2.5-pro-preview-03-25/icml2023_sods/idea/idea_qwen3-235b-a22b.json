        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core topic of sampling/optimization in discrete spaces, acknowledges the challenges, specifically mentioning the limitations of methods like GFlowNet concerning long-range dependencies (a key point in the task description). It proposes a new algorithm paradigm by combining GFlowNets and Transformers, aligning with the workshop goal of brainstorming new approaches. Furthermore, it targets applications explicitly mentioned in the task (language/protein modeling) and aims to bridge the gap between application requirements and method capabilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (GFlowNet limitations vs. Transformer strengths) is explicit. The core proposal (replacing GFlowNet policy with a Transformer) and the mechanism (using attention for global dependencies during trajectory generation) are clearly articulated. The target domains and expected outcomes are specific and understandable. There are no significant ambiguities, making the concept immediately comprehensible."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While GFlowNets and Transformers are existing concepts, the specific proposal to integrate a Transformer architecture *as the policy network* within the GFlowNet framework to explicitly handle long-range dependencies during the sequential decision-making process appears novel. It's not just applying Transformers to the domain, but modifying the core GFlowNet mechanism in a targeted way, offering a fresh perspective on improving these models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Both GFlowNets and Transformers are established technologies with existing implementations. Integrating them requires careful architectural design and potentially significant computational resources for training (due to Transformer size and GFlowNet sampling), but it relies on existing deep learning techniques and hardware. There are no obvious fundamental barriers suggesting impossibility; it's primarily an engineering and computational challenge, common in modern ML research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. It addresses a critical, acknowledged limitation (handling long-range dependencies) of a promising class of methods (GFlowNets) for discrete sampling. Success in this area could lead to major advancements in challenging and high-impact domains like controllable text generation and de novo protein design, which are explicitly mentioned as target applications suffering from these limitations. Improving sampling in these complex discrete spaces is a key research goal."
