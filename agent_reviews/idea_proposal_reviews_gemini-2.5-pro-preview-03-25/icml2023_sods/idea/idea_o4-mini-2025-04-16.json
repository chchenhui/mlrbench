        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenge of efficient sampling/optimization in discrete spaces, particularly for black-box objectives with complex correlations, which is highlighted as a key difficulty and limitation of current methods (including GFlowNets) in the task description. It proposes a new algorithmic paradigm combining GFlowNets (a mentioned research trend) with GNN surrogates and active learning, fitting the workshop's goal of discussing new algorithms. Furthermore, it explicitly targets applications like language and protein modeling, which are listed as key domains of interest in the task."

        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (GNN surrogate, GFlowNet sampler), their interaction (iterative refinement, active learning, reward recalibration), and the overall goal (reducing queries, efficient exploration) are well-defined. The concept of using a surrogate to guide GFlowNets and iteratively refining both is understandable. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific GNN architecture, the exact active learning strategy, or the precise mechanism for reward recalibration, but the fundamental research direction is clearly presented."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality and innovation. While GFlowNets, GNNs as surrogates, and active learning are existing concepts, their proposed integration within an iterative framework specifically for black-box discrete sampling driven by GFlowNets appears novel. The key innovation lies in coupling the GNN surrogate's learned landscape (and pseudo-gradients) directly with the GFlowNet generator and using active learning combined with GFlowNet reward recalibration to iteratively correct for surrogate bias and improve sampling efficiency. This specific synergistic combination addresses known limitations of GFlowNets in black-box settings."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. GNNs, GFlowNets, and active learning techniques are implementable. However, practical realization involves moderate challenges. Training an effective GNN surrogate from a small seed set, ensuring the surrogate provides useful guidance to the GFlowNet, designing an efficient active learning query strategy, and managing the computational cost of the iterative training loop require careful engineering and experimentation. The interplay between the components needs validation, but there are no fundamental roadblocks suggesting impossibility."

It targets a critical bottleneck in machine learning and computational science: efficient exploration and optimization over complex, discrete, black-box objective functions where evaluations are expensive. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially enabling progress in challenging application areas explicitly mentioned in the task description, such as language model posterior sampling, protein engineering, and combinatorial design, where current methods struggle due to query complexity and intricate dependencies."
