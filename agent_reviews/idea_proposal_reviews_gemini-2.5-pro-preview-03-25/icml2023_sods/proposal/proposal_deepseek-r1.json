        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly tackles the core challenges outlined in the task (black-box discrete sampling/optimization, expensive evaluations, high-order correlations) using GFlowNets, a key method mentioned. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the GNN surrogate, active learning loop, and reward recalibration. Furthermore, it positions itself effectively within the provided GFlowNet literature, acknowledging recent advancements while proposing a solution to address identified limitations (efficiency in black-box settings) and challenges (surrogate accuracy, exploration/exploitation, active learning strategy)."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Key components like the GNN surrogate, GFlowNet sampling, active learning, and reward recalibration are explained with supporting mathematical notation and pseudocode. The experimental design is well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for graph encoding of text or the exact implementation details of the reward recalibration using importance weights, but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While GFlowNets, GNNs, surrogate modeling, and active learning are existing techniques, their specific integration within an iterative framework for black-box discrete sampling is novel. The core idea of using a GNN surrogate to guide a GFlowNet, refining the surrogate via active learning based on GFlowNet samples, and recalibrating GFlowNet rewards based on surrogate error represents a fresh combination tailored to the problem. It clearly distinguishes itself from vanilla GFlowNets or standard surrogate optimization methods by proposing this tight, iterative coupling."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established foundations of GFlowNets, GNNs, and active learning. The overall framework is logical, and the mathematical formulations for the core components (GNN loss, GFlowNet reward, uncertainty estimation, acquisition function) are standard. The use of GNNs is appropriate for the targeted structured data. However, the proposed reward recalibration step using importance weights (f_true / f_GNN) lacks detailed justification regarding its stability, potential biases, and impact on GFlowNet convergence. While plausible, this specific mechanism requires further theoretical grounding or empirical validation to ensure its robustness. The assumption that the GNN surrogate will consistently provide reliable guidance and uncertainty estimates is also critical and requires validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing machine learning libraries and expertise in GNNs and GFlowNets. The iterative algorithm is clearly outlined. However, practical implementation presents moderate challenges. The iterative training of both the GNN surrogate and the GFlowNet could be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources. The performance hinges critically on the quality of the GNN surrogate, which might be difficult to achieve with limited initial data or for very complex objective landscapes. The active learning and reward recalibration steps add complexity to the training loop, potentially requiring careful tuning for stability and convergence. The risks associated with computational cost and surrogate model reliability are manageable but non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in many scientific and engineering domains: the high cost of evaluating black-box objective functions in discrete spaces (e.g., wet-lab experiments, complex simulations, human feedback). By aiming to drastically reduce the number of required true objective evaluations while effectively exploring complex spaces with high-order correlations, the research has the potential for major advancements. Success would significantly accelerate discovery and optimization in fields like drug/protein design, materials science, language model alignment, and combinatorial optimization, as highlighted in the proposal and the task description."
