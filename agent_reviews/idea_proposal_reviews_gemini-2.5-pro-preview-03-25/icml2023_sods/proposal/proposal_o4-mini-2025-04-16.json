        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the task description: efficient discrete sampling/optimization for black-box objectives where evaluations are expensive, specifically mentioning GFlowNets and their limitations. The proposal perfectly embodies the research idea of coupling a GNN surrogate with GFlowNets via active learning. It also explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as surrogate accuracy, exploration/exploitation balance, and active learning strategy design. The chosen application domains (language, protein) match those mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides precise mathematical formulations for the problem, surrogate model, GFlowNet objective, and uncertainty quantification. The proposed G²Flow algorithm is presented step-by-step, leaving little room for ambiguity. The experimental design is detailed, specifying benchmarks, baselines, metrics, and evaluation protocols. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the entire proposal immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While GFlowNets, GNNs, surrogate modeling, and active learning are existing concepts, their specific integration within the proposed G²Flow framework for black-box discrete sampling appears novel. The literature review focuses on GFlowNet advancements but does not cover similar active surrogate-driven approaches. The core novelty lies in the synergistic coupling of a GNN surrogate (suitable for structured discrete data) with the GFlowNet sampler, driven by an active learning loop designed to minimize expensive oracle calls by intelligently querying points based on both surrogate uncertainty and predicted reward. This combination represents a fresh perspective distinct from standard GFlowNets or typical Bayesian Optimization strategies."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations: GFlowNets (using the standard Trajectory Balance objective), GNNs for graph-structured data, and principles from Bayesian Optimization/active learning (ensemble-based uncertainty, acquisition functions). The methodology is logical, and the mathematical formulations are correctly presented. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate benchmarks, strong baselines, and relevant metrics for thorough evaluation. Minor areas for potential refinement might include a deeper discussion on the theoretical convergence properties of the iterative loop (though mentioned as an objective) and the practical stability of the importance weighting correction, but the overall approach is technically robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core components (GFlowNets, GNNs) are well-studied, and libraries exist to support their implementation. The proposed iterative algorithm is computationally intensive but implementable with standard ML hardware (GPUs). Access to oracles (simulators, pre-trained models) for the proposed benchmarks seems realistic within a research context. The main challenges lie in the engineering effort required to integrate the components effectively and the significant hyperparameter tuning likely needed for the active learning loop and the GNN/GFlowNet training. However, these are common research challenges, and the overall plan appears realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck—the high cost of function evaluations—in applying powerful sampling methods like GFlowNets to black-box discrete optimization and sampling problems. These problems are prevalent in high-impact domains like constrained language generation, drug discovery (protein/molecular design), and combinatorial engineering. A successful outcome, achieving the anticipated 5-10x reduction in oracle queries, would represent a major advancement, making previously intractable problems feasible. The work has the potential to establish a new paradigm for efficient exploration in complex discrete spaces."
