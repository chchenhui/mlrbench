        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task description: efficient sampling/optimization in discrete spaces for black-box objectives with complex correlations, explicitly mentioning GFlowNets and their limitations in this context. The methodology is a detailed elaboration of the research idea, focusing on the GNN surrogate and active learning to reduce expensive function evaluations. It positions itself well relative to the GFlowNet literature provided, aiming to enhance GFlowNets for black-box settings, a gap implicitly suggested by the task description and the focus of the literature review on GFlowNet capabilities and applications rather than surrogate integration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, outlining the motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes logically. The iterative framework involving the GNN surrogate, GFlowNet sampling, and active learning is presented step-by-step. However, some technical details could be more precise. Specifically, the exact mechanism by which the GNN surrogate 'guides' the GFlowNet sampling (e.g., modifying rewards, policies, or action probabilities) is not fully specified. Additionally, the GFlowNet 'recalibration' step and its corresponding loss function (`L_recalibrate`) could be explained more clearly regarding how it interacts with the standard GFlowNet training objective and the use of true vs. surrogate rewards. The assumption that the GNN provides variance estimates for uncertainty quantification should also be explicitly stated and justified (e.g., via Bayesian GNNs, ensembles, or dropout)."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While surrogate-assisted optimization is a known paradigm, the specific combination of using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) as the surrogate, coupling it with Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) for diverse discrete sampling, and incorporating active learning based on surrogate uncertainty for efficient refinement appears novel. The literature review focuses on GFlowNet applications and variations but does not cover this specific synergistic integration. The novelty lies in leveraging GNNs for structured discrete spaces within a GFlowNet framework and using active learning to tightly couple the surrogate and sampler for black-box objectives, distinguishing it from standard GFlowNet applications or typical surrogate modeling approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established techniques (GNNs, GFlowNets, Active Learning). The rationale for combining these components to address the black-box setting is logical. The methodology outlines the steps and provides loss functions. However, as mentioned under Clarity, the precise formulation of the GFlowNet guidance and recalibration mechanism lacks full rigor. Furthermore, the proposal assumes the GNN can provide reliable uncertainty estimates for active learning, which might require specific GNN architectures (e.g., Bayesian GNNs, ensembles) that are not specified. While the overall approach is well-founded, these specific points require further technical detail and justification to achieve higher soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. GNNs, GFlowNets, and active learning are implementable techniques. The iterative nature of the framework is conceptually clear. However, the implementation complexity is non-trivial, requiring careful integration of the three components. Training GNNs and GFlowNets iteratively can be computationally demanding, requiring appropriate hardware resources. Key risks include the potential for the GNN surrogate to be inaccurate, especially early on, potentially misleading the GFlowNet, and the effectiveness of the chosen active learning strategy. Overall, it's feasible with significant engineering effort and computational resources, carrying manageable technical risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It tackles a critical and widely recognized challenge: efficient sampling and optimization over complex, discrete, black-box objective functions. This problem is prevalent in high-impact domains mentioned in the proposal and task description, such as language modeling, protein engineering, drug discovery, and combinatorial optimization. If successful, the proposed method's ability to drastically reduce the number of expensive true objective evaluations could enable breakthroughs and accelerate progress in these fields by making previously intractable problems accessible. The potential impact is substantial."
