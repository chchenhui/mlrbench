    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for research on 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' and 'Trustworthy AI'. The objectives and methodology are a direct elaboration of the research idea, focusing on detecting AI-generated responses using contrastive learning. Furthermore, it explicitly builds upon and aims to overcome the limitations of existing methods (e.g., GPTZero, ConDA, watermarking) identified in the literature review, such as poor generalizability, susceptibility to adversarial attacks, and lack of explainability. The focus on educational assessments, multimodal data, and high-order reasoning tasks is consistent throughout."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides a good level of detail on the research design, data sources, model architecture (including the loss function), adversarial training strategy, feature engineering concepts, and evaluation plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor areas for improvement include the lack of the referenced Figure 1 (which would visually clarify the architecture) and slight vagueness in the precise implementation details of some components like the 'graph-based semantic analysis' or the 'GAN-style setup'. However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using contrastive learning for AI text detection is established in the literature (ConDA, DeTeCtive, WhosAI), the novelty lies in its specific application and enhancement for the educational assessment domain. Key novel aspects include: (1) tailoring the framework for multimodal educational data (text, code, math proofs), (2) focusing on detecting AI use in high-order thinking tasks, (3) combining contrastive learning with domain adversarial networks (GRL), specific adversarial training against paraphrasing, and domain-specific feature engineering (reasoning coherence, creativity patterns, error distributions) within a single framework, and (4) emphasizing explainability for educator trust in this specific context. It represents a novel synthesis and application of existing techniques to address a specific, challenging problem, rather than a completely groundbreaking method."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, domain adaptation via GRL, adversarial training, SHAP for explainability) and relevant, recent literature. The methodology is well-structured and employs established techniques. The contrastive loss function is correctly formulated. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics. Potential challenges, such as the effective extraction and utility of domain-specific features (e.g., 'reasoning coherence', 'creativity patterns'), are acknowledged implicitly but the overall approach is technically robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Data collection relies on public datasets and LFM generation, which is standard. The required ML techniques and models (Transformers, contrastive learning, GRL, SHAP) are well-supported by existing libraries. The phased research plan is realistic. However, achieving the ambitious performance targets (≥90% F1, <5% performance drop under attack) presents a significant challenge. Curating a truly representative multimodal dataset covering diverse subjects and high-order tasks might be demanding. Robustly implementing and validating the novel domain-specific features could also pose difficulties. Overall, it's feasible but requires significant effort and potentially faces challenges in reaching the stated performance goals."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: maintaining academic integrity in educational assessments amidst the rise of powerful generative AI. The potential impact is substantial, as a reliable and robust detection tool like *SecureED* could preserve the validity of assessments, foster trust, enable the responsible adoption of AI in education, and contribute valuable techniques to the broader field of AI text detection. The focus on high-stakes assessments, cross-domain robustness, and explainability directly tackles critical needs identified by educators and institutions. Success would represent a major advancement in AI accountability for education."
