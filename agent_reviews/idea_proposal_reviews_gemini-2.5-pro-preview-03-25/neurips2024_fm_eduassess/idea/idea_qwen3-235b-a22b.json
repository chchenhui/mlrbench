        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on Large Foundation Models (LFMs) for Educational Assessment, and explicitly lists 'Large foundation models for automated scoring' and 'Trustworthy AI (Fairness, Explainability, Privacy) for educational assessment' as key topics. The idea directly addresses the challenge mentioned in the workshop description regarding the inadequate explainability of LFMs hindering their adoption in education, proposing an explainable framework specifically for LFM-based automated essay scoring (AES)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (transparency gap in LFM-based AES), the main proposal (a rationale-guided explanation module generating structural and semantic explanations), the method (integrating rubric constraints during fine-tuning), and the evaluation plan (correlation, stakeholder comprehension, robustness). The concepts are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity, making the research direction immediately understandable. Minor details on the exact architecture of the explanation module could be added, but the overall concept is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While explainable AI (XAI) and automated essay scoring are established fields, applying XAI specifically to large foundation models within AES is a relatively new and important area. The proposed approach of combining both structural (attention-based) and semantic (natural language) rationales, and particularly the integration of rubric-based constraints directly into the fine-tuning process to guide explanation generation for LFMs, offers a fresh perspective compared to standard post-hoc explanation methods or simpler fine-tuning approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. Fine-tuning LFMs, analyzing attention, and generating natural language explanations are standard techniques. However, effectively integrating complex, potentially nuanced rubric criteria as constraints during fine-tuning requires careful design and may be technically challenging. Ensuring the generated explanations are faithful to the model's reasoning process and genuinely useful to stakeholders is a non-trivial research problem in XAI. Access to proprietary models (like GPT-4) for fine-tuning might also pose resource or API limitations. Evaluating stakeholder comprehension requires careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the 'black box' nature of LFMs in high-stakes educational assessments like essay scoring is critical for building trust and facilitating responsible adoption, as highlighted in the workshop's call. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in trustworthy AI for education, providing educators with tools to understand and potentially refine AI-driven scoring, thereby bridging the gap between powerful AI capabilities and educational accountability requirements. The potential impact on the acceptance and utility of AI in education is substantial."
