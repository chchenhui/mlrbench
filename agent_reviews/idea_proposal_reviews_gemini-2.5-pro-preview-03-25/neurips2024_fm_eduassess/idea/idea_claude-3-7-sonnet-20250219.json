    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of applying Large Foundation Models (LFMs) to educational assessment. Specifically, it tackles the explicitly mentioned challenges of 'explainability and accountability' which limit LFM adoption, and proposes a solution relevant to 'automated scoring' and 'Trustworthy AI (Explainability)'. The focus on multimodal responses also aligns with the potential for 'multimodal item design' mentioned in the workshop description preamble. It fits perfectly within the solicited topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the proposed dual-stage framework (LFM scoring/reasoning + specialized validation module) is explained logically. The inputs (multimodal student responses) and outputs (detailed assessment report) are specified. The core concept is easy to grasp. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanism of the validation module and how the 'dialogue' between stages is implemented, but these are details that can be elaborated upon in a full paper."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using LFMs for scoring or focusing on XAI in education are known areas, the proposed dual-stage architecture is innovative. Specifically, the concept of a first-stage LFM generating a reasoning trace, which is then explicitly validated and potentially refined by a second, specialized, rubric-aware module, offers a fresh approach to structured explainability in AI assessment. Applying this to multimodal inputs further enhances its novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. Accessing or fine-tuning large multimodal models (Stage 1) is becoming more practical. The main hurdle lies in developing and training the specialized evaluation module (Stage 2), which requires curated data linking LFM reasoning traces to rubric criteria and expert validation. Obtaining sufficient multimodal student response data with detailed rubrics might also be challenging. Significant effort in data collection, annotation, and model development is required, but it's within the realm of current research capabilities."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses a critical bottleneck ('explainability and accountability') hindering the adoption of powerful LFMs in high-stakes educational assessments, a key issue highlighted in the workshop call. If successful, this framework could substantially increase trust in AI-assisted scoring, improve the validity of assessments for complex multimodal tasks, and provide more transparent feedback to stakeholders. This represents a potentially major advancement in trustworthy AI for education."
