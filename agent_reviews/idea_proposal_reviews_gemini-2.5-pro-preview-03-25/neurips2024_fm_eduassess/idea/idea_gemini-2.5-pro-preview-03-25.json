        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed for the workshop, including 'Large foundation models for automated scoring', 'Finetune large foundation models for educational assessment', and 'Trustworthy AI (Fairness, Explainability, Privacy) for educational assessment'. It specifically targets the challenge of explainability and accountability of LFMs in education, which is highlighted as a major concern in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (lack of explainability in LFM scoring), the proposed solution (CHAIN-OF-RUBRIC), the mechanism (generating scores and rubric-grounded step-by-step reasoning), the method (fine-tuning on specific datasets), and the expected outcomes (transparency, actionable feedback, trust). The name itself effectively conveys the core concept. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using LFMs for scoring and focusing on explainability are existing research areas, and chain-of-thought prompting is a known technique, the specific proposal to fine-tune LFMs to generate explanations explicitly structured around and grounded in a provided rubric ('CHAIN-OF-RUBRIC') is a novel approach. It combines existing concepts in a targeted way to address the specific need for rubric-aligned explanations in educational assessment, going beyond generic explanation methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Access to LFMs and fine-tuning techniques is readily available. The main challenge lies in creating or obtaining the necessary fine-tuning dataset: student responses paired with expert scores and, crucially, detailed 'rubric-based feedback chains'. Generating these detailed, rubric-grounded explanations for a sufficiently large dataset would require significant expert human effort. However, this is a common challenge in supervised fine-tuning and is achievable within a research project context, making the overall idea feasible, albeit requiring considerable effort for data preparation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Lack of explainability and trust is a major barrier to the adoption of AI, particularly LFMs, in educational assessment, especially for high-stakes situations. By directly linking the LFM's scoring process to the established rubric criteria used by educators, this approach tackles this barrier head-on. If successful, it could significantly enhance the transparency, trustworthiness, and diagnostic value of automated scoring systems, leading to wider acceptance and more effective use in education."
