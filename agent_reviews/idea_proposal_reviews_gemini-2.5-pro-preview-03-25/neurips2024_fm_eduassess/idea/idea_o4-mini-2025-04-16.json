        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Large Foundation Models for Educational Assessment'. Furthermore, it targets several specific topics listed in the call for papers, including 'Large foundation models for automated scoring', 'Finetune large foundation models for educational assessment', and crucially, 'Trustworthy AI (Fairness, Explainability, Privacy) for educational assessment'. The motivation explicitly highlights the explainability challenge mentioned in the task description as a key barrier to adoption in high-stakes assessments, which the proposed idea aims to solve."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-stated, outlining the problem of 'black box' models in automated scoring. The proposed two-phase framework (Chain-of-Thought Prompting for rationale generation and Saliency Attribution for explanation) is clearly defined. The specific techniques (CoT, Integrated Gradients) are mentioned, and the expected outputs (score, rationale, highlighted evidence) are specified. The evaluation plan using public datasets and educator feedback is also clear. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using LLMs for automated scoring and employing Chain-of-Thought prompting are increasingly explored, the specific combination proposed here is innovative. The novelty lies primarily in the two-stage approach: first, fine-tuning an LLM to generate structured, rubric-aligned rationales via CoT, and second, applying saliency attribution techniques *specifically to these generated rationales* to quantify the contribution of each reasoning step to the final score and link it back to textual evidence. This method for generating fine-grained, evidence-backed explanations for AES scores offers a fresh perspective compared to standard attention-based or input-perturbation explainability methods applied directly to the final score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Fine-tuning large language models and implementing Chain-of-Thought prompting are established practices, although computationally intensive. Saliency attribution techniques like Integrated Gradients are also well-documented and implementable. Public essay datasets are available for evaluation. A potential challenge lies in obtaining or creating a sufficiently large and high-quality dataset of essays annotated not just with scores but with detailed, rubric-aligned rationales suitable for CoT fine-tuning. However, this is a data acquisition/annotation challenge rather than a fundamental technical barrier. The overall approach is technically sound and implementable with current ML knowledge and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and impact potential. Addressing the lack of explainability and trust in AI-based automated scoring systems is a critical challenge, particularly for high-stakes educational assessments where fairness and accountability are paramount. By proposing a method to generate not just scores but also clear, rubric-aligned rationales with supporting evidence, this research could significantly enhance stakeholder (educators, students, administrators) confidence and facilitate the responsible adoption of LLMs in education. Success could lead to major advancements in trustworthy AI for educational assessment."
