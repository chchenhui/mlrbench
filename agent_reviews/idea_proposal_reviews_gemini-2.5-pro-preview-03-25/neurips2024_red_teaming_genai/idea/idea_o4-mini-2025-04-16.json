        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses the core themes of the task description. It focuses on discovering and quantitatively evaluating harmful capabilities ('Adaptive Adversarial Prompt Curriculum'), tackles the problem of static benchmarks becoming outdated ('continuously surface emerging vulnerabilities', 'adapts to model updates'), and proposes a method relevant to ongoing red teaming efforts. It aligns perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on quantitative evaluation, probing model limitations, and addressing the dynamic nature of AI risks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with distinct components (Generator, Evaluation, Clustering, Curriculum Update) and a logical workflow. The motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes are well-articulated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the 'meta-fine-tuning' process for the generator, the precise mechanisms for automated failure detection during evaluation (a non-trivial task), and the exact implementation of the diversity clustering and feedback loop biasing."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While automated red teaming, adversarial prompt generation, and curriculum learning are existing concepts, the novelty lies in integrating these into a specific closed-loop, adaptive system. The use of a meta-fine-tuned smaller generator, combined with diversity clustering and an explicit feedback mechanism to target underexplored attack vectors for *continual* red teaming benchmark generation, offers a fresh perspective compared to static benchmarks or less structured automated attack generation methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The concept is theoretically sound, but practical implementation faces challenges. The most significant hurdle is the 'Evaluation & Filtering' step â€“ reliably and automatically detecting diverse safety, privacy, and truthfulness failures induced by prompts is difficult and an active research area. Training the generator effectively, defining robust clustering metrics that capture both semantics and failure modes, and managing the computational cost of continuous evaluation also require careful engineering. It's feasible but requires overcoming significant technical hurdles, particularly in automated evaluation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a critical and timely problem in AI safety: the need for scalable, dynamic, and continuous red teaming to keep pace with rapidly evolving generative models. Static benchmarks quickly become inadequate, and manual red teaming is resource-intensive. A successful implementation could lead to major advancements in proactively identifying and mitigating emerging risks, significantly contributing to the development of more trustworthy AI systems. The potential impact is very high."
