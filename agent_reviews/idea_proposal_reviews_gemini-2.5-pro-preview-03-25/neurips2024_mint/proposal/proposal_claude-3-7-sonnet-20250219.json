        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the MINT workshop's focus on interventions (activation engineering, mechanistic interventions, targeted editing) and PEFT for controllability and harm mitigation. It faithfully expands on the research idea of using causal tracing to find minimal circuits and applying targeted interventions (low-rank 'circuit breakers', activation offsets). It effectively incorporates concepts from the literature review (causal tracing, activation steering, LoRA/PEFT, specific harm mitigation studies) and explicitly aims to tackle the key challenges identified (circuit identification, targeted intervention, capability preservation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and logically follow from the introduction. The methodology is broken down into coherent phases (Identification, Intervention, Evaluation) with detailed steps, including specific techniques (causal tracing, low-rank adaptations, activation steering) and evaluation metrics. The rationale for the approach is well-articulated, contrasting it with existing methods. The structure is logical and easy to follow. While some implementation details could be further specified, the overall plan is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation, primarily through the synthesis and specific application of existing techniques. While it leverages known methods like causal tracing, PEFT (LoRA), and activation steering (all cited), it combines them into a systematic framework focused on identifying *minimal* causal circuits for specific harms and developing *surgical* interventions ('circuit breakers'). The concept of trainable, low-rank 'circuit breakers' optimized specifically to neutralize identified harmful circuits while preserving general capabilities represents a novel application of PEFT. The dynamic intervention selection framework also adds an element of novelty. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it builds on prior work, but the specific framework, focus on minimality, and the 'circuit breaker' concept offer fresh perspectives distinct from the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (causal inference, low-rank adaptation, activation manipulation) and established methods cited in the literature review. The proposed methodology (causal tracing, low-rank training, activation vector optimization, comprehensive evaluation) is generally well-defined and justified. Technical formulations, while sometimes simplified, appear correct in principle (e.g., LoRA-style updates, loss function structure). It acknowledges the need to balance harm reduction and performance preservation. Minor gaps exist in detailing the exact algorithm for minimal circuit identification and potential challenges in ensuring true causality and avoiding negative interference, but the overall approach is technically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, assuming access to significant computational resources (for causal tracing and model training/evaluation) and relevant expertise. The plan is ambitious but generally realistic, outlining clear steps. Causal tracing at scale can be computationally intensive, and creating the specialized datasets requires effort. Identifying truly *minimal* circuits robustly might be challenging. Training low-rank adaptations is generally efficient. The evaluation plan is standard but comprehensive. There are manageable risks related to computational cost, the precision of circuit identification, and potential unforeseen impacts on model capabilities, but the project appears implementable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of mitigating harms in foundation models, a major challenge for responsible AI deployment. By aiming for precise, computationally efficient interventions that preserve general capabilities, it tackles key limitations of current approaches. Success would lead to major advancements in model control, safety, and interpretability. The expected outcomes (framework, techniques, open-source tools) have substantial potential for academic impact (advancing interpretability and model editing) and practical impact (enabling safer deployment of LLMs), contributing significantly to AI safety and alignment goals."
