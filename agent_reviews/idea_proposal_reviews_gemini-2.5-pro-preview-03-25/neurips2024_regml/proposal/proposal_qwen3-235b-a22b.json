    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: operationalizing regulatory guidelines (fairness, privacy, explainability), evaluating compliance (stress-test benchmark), and mitigating tensions between desiderata (multi-objective optimization). The methodology clearly elaborates on the research idea's components (causal graphs, adversarial training, benchmark). It effectively integrates concepts from the literature review (causality for trade-offs, adversarial fairness) while aiming to address the identified challenge of harmonizing multiple principles simultaneously."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and logically presented. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology sections detail the proposed steps, algorithms (PC algorithm, adversarial training), and mathematical formulations. The use of synthetic and real-world data, evaluation metrics, and baselines is clearly outlined. However, there is a minor ambiguity or potential inconsistency in Section 2.3 regarding the privacy objective: the text mentions a Privacy Discriminator D_P ensuring \\\\epsilon-differential privacy, but the corresponding loss term \\\\mathcal{L}_P is defined as a reconstruction loss, and its connection to D_P or \\\\epsilon-DP is not explicitly clarified. This specific point slightly detracts from perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating causal disentanglement with multi-objective adversarial learning to *simultaneously* address fairness, privacy, and explainability within a unified framework. While individual components (causal inference, adversarial learning, fairness/privacy/explainability methods) exist, their specific combination and application to explicitly model and mitigate conflicts arising from regulatory demands is novel. Particularly innovative aspects include the causal disentanglement of latent representations (Z_S, Z_{\\\\perp}) based on regulatory relevance and the formulation of the multi-objective loss including an explicit term for explainability consistency (\\mathcal{L}_E). The 'regulatory stress-test' benchmark concept is also a valuable contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, grounding its approach in established methods like causal inference (PC algorithm) and adversarial learning. However, there are weaknesses impacting rigor. The use of the PC algorithm is standard but relies on strong assumptions that might not hold in practice. More critically, the formulation of the privacy objective (\\mathcal{L}_P) as a reconstruction loss (\\|X - \\\\text{Reconstruct}(Z_{\\\\perp})\\|) seems weakly justified as a mechanism for ensuring \\\\epsilon-differential privacy, especially given the mention of a privacy discriminator D_P whose role in the loss is unclear. Standard DP mechanisms (like DP-SGD, mentioned as a baseline) might be more appropriate and rigorous. The explainability loss (\\mathcal{L}_E) based on SHAP KL divergence is interesting but its theoretical connection to fulfilling diverse regulatory explainability requirements needs stronger justification. The rest of the methodology (causal disentanglement idea, fairness objective, evaluation plan) appears sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current ML techniques and computational resources. Synthetic data generation is straightforward. Accessing and using real-world datasets like MIMIC-III is standard practice, albeit requiring appropriate handling. Implementing causal discovery (PC algorithm) and adversarial training frameworks is achievable. However, challenges exist: causal discovery accuracy is data-dependent; multi-objective adversarial training can be complex to tune and ensure convergence; validating the effectiveness of the specific privacy and explainability mechanisms requires careful experimentation. The project is ambitious, requiring significant expertise and computational effort, but the plan is generally realistic within a research context with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the gap between multifaceted regulatory requirements (fairness, privacy, explainability) and the capabilities of current ML systems. Harmonizing these often-conflicting desiderata is critical for deploying trustworthy AI in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance. Success would yield substantial contributions: a novel framework for principled compliance, empirical insights into regulatory trade-offs, practical tools (open-source code, benchmark) for auditing, and potential guidance for policymakers. The research directly aligns with pressing societal needs and regulatory trends (e.g., EU AI Act), positioning it for high impact."
