    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory policies by proposing a framework to operationalize and harmonize fairness, privacy, and explainability. It explicitly tackles the 'tensions between different desiderata' mentioned in the task description and builds directly upon the core concepts outlined in the research idea (causal disentanglement, multi-objective adversarial training, benchmarking). Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to address the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as interdependencies and multi-objective optimization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the significance is well-argued. The methodology section is detailed, outlining the causal modeling approach, the multi-objective adversarial training architecture and algorithm, and the benchmarking strategy with specific metrics. Technical formulations (equations) are provided, enhancing clarity for experts. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes/Impact), making it easy to follow the research plan. Minor ambiguities are absent, and the rationale is consistently explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like causal inference for fairness/explainability (Ji et al., Grabowicz et al.) and adversarial learning for fairness/privacy (Lahoti et al.) exist, the core novelty lies in the proposed synthesis: using a *causal disentanglement* framework specifically to understand the interdependencies between *fairness, privacy, and explainability simultaneously*, and then leveraging this understanding to design a *multi-objective adversarial training* process for joint optimization. This holistic approach targeting the F+P+X triad via causal disentanglement and adversarial learning appears distinct from prior work cited and represents a fresh perspective on achieving comprehensive regulatory compliance."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in well-established theoretical foundations, including causal inference (Pearl, Spirtes, Chickering) and adversarial machine learning. The proposed methodology employs standard and appropriate techniques for causal discovery (PC, GES), causal effect estimation (TE, MI), mediation analysis, and multi-objective adversarial optimization. The technical formulations for loss functions and causal effects are clearly presented and appear correct. The evaluation plan includes relevant metrics and necessary comparisons/ablations. While practical challenges like causal graph accuracy exist, the proposed approach is methodologically robust and well-justified within the current state-of-the-art."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Accessing and using sensitive real-world data (healthcare, finance) can be complex, although standard benchmarks are mentioned. The computational requirements for causal discovery on complex datasets and, particularly, for training the multi-objective adversarial system with multiple discriminators will be substantial, requiring significant resources. Integrating the different components (causal modeling, adversarial training, benchmarking) is complex and requires considerable engineering effort and expertise across multiple ML subfields. While achievable, the ambition level implies moderate risks related to computational cost, data access, and successful convergence/tuning of the adversarial system."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the gap between complex regulatory demands (fairness, privacy, explainability) and the capabilities of current ML systems. Developing a framework to unify these principles and manage trade-offs would be a major advancement for trustworthy AI. The potential impact spans ML research (new methods, benchmarks), industry (deployable compliant systems), policy (understanding technical feasibility and trade-offs), and society (safer, fairer AI). It directly aligns with the pressing need for 'Regulatable ML' as highlighted in the task description."
