    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the task description, such as the data bottleneck, model collapse in self-improvement, the need for methods distinct from standard SL/RL, adapting to verifier errors, and safety/alignment concerns (weak-to-strong generalization, value misalignment). The methodology faithfully implements the research idea's core components (uncertainty-aware verifier ensemble, dynamic calibration, trusted buffer). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and cites key papers from the literature review (Wang et al., 2024; Grey & Black, 2024; Johnson & Lee, 2023; Alemohammad et al., 2024), grounding the approach in recent relevant work and addressing the identified challenges like verifier drift and model collapse."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology (verifier ensemble, uncertainty weighting, dynamic calibration), and experimental plan are understandable. The structure is logical. However, there are minor ambiguities: the exact definition of the self-generated target \\\\hat{y}_i in the loss function could be more explicit, the theoretical guarantee of \\\\epsilon-stability lacks a formal definition within the proposal, and there are minor formatting/typographical errors (e.g., section numbering '2.41', 'lemlemohammad' reference). These points slightly detract from perfect clarity but do not obscure the main thrust of the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several recent concepts (uncertainty quantification via ensembles, dynamic calibration, trusted data buffers) into an integrated framework specifically designed for mitigating model collapse and verifier drift in foundation model self-improvement. While individual components draw inspiration from cited works, the specific combination—particularly the dynamic recalibration of the verifier ensemble using a trusted buffer within an uncertainty-weighted self-improvement loop—offers a fresh perspective tailored to this problem. It's not introducing entirely new techniques but proposes a novel and well-motivated application and integration of existing ones."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and methodologically rigorous, built upon established ML principles like ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation and calibration techniques. The use of coefficient of variation for uncertainty and exponential weighting is plausible. The iterative improvement loop with recalibration is logically structured. However, its soundness relies on key assumptions that require empirical validation: 1) the effectiveness of ensemble disagreement as a proxy for problematic data, 2) the practical availability and impact of the 'trusted data buffer', and 3) the feasibility of proving the claimed theoretical stability guarantees, which are non-trivial in such dynamic systems. The technical formulations provided are mostly correct but the theoretical claims need stronger justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current ML technology and frameworks. Training FMs, ensembles, and implementing the iterative loop are standard practices, albeit computationally intensive. The main feasibility challenges lie in: 1) the acquisition and maintenance of a sufficiently large and diverse 'trusted data buffer' \\\\mathcal{B}, 2) the potentially significant computational overhead associated with training and querying the verifier ensemble frequently, and 3) the inherent difficulty in proving strong theoretical guarantees for complex learning systems. The experimental plan across different domains seems achievable with adequate resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem at the forefront of AI research: enabling reliable self-improvement for foundation models to overcome data limitations and scale capabilities safely. Mitigating model collapse and verifier drift are critical challenges. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially enabling more sustainable FM scaling, improving AI safety through controlled autonomous learning, and impacting applications in data-constrained domains like robotics and healthcare. The focus on the verification-generation gap and alignment with safety principles further enhances its importance."
