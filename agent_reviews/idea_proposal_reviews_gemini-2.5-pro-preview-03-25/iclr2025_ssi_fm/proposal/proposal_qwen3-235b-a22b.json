    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the task (data bottleneck, model collapse, verification-generation gap, safety/alignment) and proposes a solution centered on the research idea (uncertainty-aware self-improvement with dynamic calibration). It effectively integrates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, citing key papers like UAL [1], SIMS [3], and implicitly AUGCAL/Calibrated Self-Training [8]. The objectives, methodology, and significance directly map to the requirements and goals set forth in the provided context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes), objectives are clearly stated, and the core methodology (ensemble verification, uncertainty weighting, dynamic recalibration) is well-described. The experimental design is detailed and comprehensive. Minor areas could benefit from refinement, such as the precise mechanism for pseudo-labeling verifiers or a more concrete formulation of the theoretical bounds beyond mentioning a Lyapunov-type inequality. However, the overall research plan is understandable and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts (ensemble uncertainty, adaptive weighting, dynamic calibration, trust buffers) into a cohesive framework specifically designed for mitigating collapse and ensuring stability in FM self-improvement. While individual components exist in the literature (as shown in the review), their synthesis for this specific problem, particularly the tight coupling of ensemble uncertainty with dynamic verifier recalibration within the self-improvement loop, appears novel. It offers a fresh perspective compared to cited works like UAL [1] or SIMS [3]."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established ML principles like ensemble methods for uncertainty, calibration techniques (ECE), and self-training paradigms. The rationale for addressing verifier drift and using uncertainty for sample weighting is well-justified. The methodology, including the uncertainty formulation and recalibration loop, is technically plausible. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate baselines and metrics. Minor weaknesses include the reliance on several hyperparameters requiring tuning and the less developed theoretical analysis section compared to the empirical plan."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant practical challenges. It explicitly requires substantial computational resources (512 A100s, LLaMA-3 scale models), which limits its execution to well-funded labs. The methodology involves complex interactions between multiple components (generator, verifiers, buffer), demanding sophisticated engineering and debugging. Hyperparameter tuning (K, alpha, gamma, M, delta, lambda) will likely be resource-intensive. While relying on existing technologies, the scale and complexity make implementation non-trivial, introducing moderate execution risk. However, given the specified resources, it is achievable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: enabling scalable and safe self-improvement for foundation models to overcome data limitations. Mitigating model collapse and ensuring reliable training without constant human supervision are critical challenges for the future of AI. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially enabling more data-efficient and robust FM development. The focus on uncertainty, calibration, and safety metrics (entrenchment bias, alignment) directly contributes to responsible AI research, aligning strongly with the task description's emphasis on safety."
