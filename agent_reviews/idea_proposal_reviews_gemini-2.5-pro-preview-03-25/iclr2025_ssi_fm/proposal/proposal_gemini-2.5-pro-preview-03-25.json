        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of the 'data wall' and the need for self-improvement outlined in the task. It tackles the specific challenges mentioned, such as model collapse, reliance on imperfect verifiers, and the distinction from standard SL/RL. The proposed solution (AUSI-DC) is a direct and detailed elaboration of the research idea, incorporating ensemble uncertainty and dynamic calibration. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review (uncertainty awareness, calibration, model collapse, verifier drift) and explicitly connects to workshop goals like training without collapse and safety/alignment (weak-to-strong generalization)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to the proposed solution, objectives, detailed methodology, and expected outcomes. Key concepts like AUSI-DC, uncertainty quantification via ensemble disagreement, and dynamic calibration are explained precisely. The methodology section provides clear algorithmic steps and includes mathematical formulations where appropriate. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The experimental design is well-articulated. There is minimal ambiguity, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing existing concepts in a novel way to address the specific problem of stable self-improvement. While components like ensemble uncertainty estimation, calibration techniques, and self-training on synthetic data exist individually (as acknowledged and referenced), their integration into a single framework (AUSI-DC) featuring *adaptive* data weighting based on uncertainty and *dynamic* verifier calibration specifically to prevent collapse in FM self-improvement is innovative. It clearly distinguishes itself from naive self-improvement or methods using only single verifiers or static uncertainty measures. The novelty lies in the specific combination and application tailored to this challenging learning paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It builds upon established machine learning principles like ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation (using disagreement as a proxy) and model calibration. The rationale for addressing verifier drift via dynamic calibration using a trusted data buffer is well-argued. The proposed methodology, including the mathematical formulations for uncertainty and weighting, is appropriate. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, metrics (including stability and calibration measures), and ablation studies, indicating methodological rigor. While the effectiveness of ensemble disagreement as the *optimal* uncertainty signal and the practicalities of calibration require empirical validation, the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily related to computational cost and complexity. Training and running an ensemble of verifiers, performing iterative generation, verification, calibration, and foundation model updates will be computationally intensive, requiring substantial resources typical of large-scale FM research. Integrating all components into a stable system and tuning the dynamic calibration mechanism (frequency, buffer management, update method) and uncertainty weighting parameters will require careful engineering and experimentation. While technically achievable with existing methods, the resource requirements and tuning complexity make it demanding, placing it at a 'Good' feasibility level, acknowledging these practical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: overcoming data limitations and ensuring stable self-improvement for foundation models. This is a critical bottleneck for future AI progress. Successfully developing a robust method like AUSI-DC would have a major impact by enabling continuous learning, reducing reliance on finite human-curated data, and potentially leading to more capable AI systems. Furthermore, the focus on stability, uncertainty, and calibration directly contributes to AI safety and alignment research, addressing concerns about model collapse and uncontrolled behavior during self-improvement, aligning well with the task description's emphasis on responsible development and weak-to-strong generalization."
