        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop call for papers). It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of bridging the accessibility and efficiency gap for foundation models in biology. The motivation explicitly mentions the resource constraints and usability issues highlighted in the workshop description. The proposed methods (parameter efficiency, compression, quantization, efficient training, accessible interfaces, lab in the loop) map directly onto the specific topics listed in the call for papers."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main idea (broken into compression, training, and interfaces), expected outcomes, and potential impact are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The specific techniques mentioned (pruning, quantization, distillation) add to the clarity. While it could be slightly more specific about the target biological data or tasks, it provides a very strong and understandable overview of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty within the context of applying ML to biological discovery. While the core techniques (model compression, quantization, efficient training) are established areas in general ML, their specific application to biological foundation models, combined with a focus on user-friendly interfaces and iterative refinement ('lab in the loop') for biologists, offers a fresh and timely perspective. The novelty lies in the targeted integration and application to solve the specific accessibility problem in biology, rather than inventing fundamentally new compression algorithms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Techniques for model compression and quantization are mature, and libraries/tools are available. Efficient training methods are actively researched but applicable techniques exist. Building user-friendly interfaces is standard practice, although it requires engineering effort. Access to relevant biological foundation models and datasets is increasingly possible. The main challenge lies in the successful integration of these components and potentially the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, but it is well within the realm of current capabilities."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck preventing the widespread adoption of powerful foundation models in biological research and clinical settings due to resource and expertise limitations. Successfully developing efficient and accessible models could democratize advanced ML for biologists and clinicians, potentially accelerating discovery and improving healthcare outcomes. The focus on usability and iterative refinement further enhances its potential impact."
