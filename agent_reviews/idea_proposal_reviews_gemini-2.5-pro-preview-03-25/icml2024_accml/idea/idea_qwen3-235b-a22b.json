        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of bridging the gap between ML research and lab use by focusing on efficient and accessible foundation models for biological discovery. Specifically, it targets 'Efficient fine-tuning and adaptation', 'Lab in the loop: iterative approaches', and 'Hypothesis-driven machine learning... and uncertainty modeling', all explicitly listed as desired topics. The motivation and proposed method directly tackle the accessibility, efficiency, and iterative adaptation challenges highlighted in the workshop call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation outlines the problem effectively. The core concept of 'prompt-based iterative adaptation' is explained concisely, detailing the use of lightweight prompts trained on sparse experimental data. Key components like the Bayesian framework for uncertainty and experiment prioritization are mentioned, along with the evaluation plan (comparison against full fine-tuning and LoRA on relevant datasets). The language is precise, and the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While prompt tuning itself is an established technique, its specific application to iterative adaptation of biological foundation models using sparse lab feedback, combined with a Bayesian framework for uncertainty-guided experiment selection, represents a novel synthesis. It's not just applying prompt tuning off-the-shelf but tailoring it to the 'lab-in-the-loop' paradigm for biological discovery. This integration of efficient adaptation, uncertainty quantification, and experimental guidance offers a fresh perspective compared to standard fine-tuning or simpler prompt-tuning applications."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Prompt tuning is inherently parameter-efficient, making the core adaptation mechanism computationally tractable even with limited resources, aligning well with the workshop's goals. Pre-trained biological foundation models and relevant datasets (like AAV design) are increasingly available. Implementing prompt tuning and Bayesian optimization is achievable with existing ML frameworks. Potential challenges include optimizing the integration between prompt learning and the Bayesian framework and ensuring effectiveness with truly sparse data, but these seem like addressable research questions rather than fundamental roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck limiting the adoption of powerful foundation models in biological labs: the need for efficient, low-cost, iterative adaptation based on experimental results. Success would democratize access to cutting-edge ML for smaller labs, potentially accelerating the pace of biological discovery significantly. By enabling non-experts to refine models and guiding experiments through uncertainty estimation, it could foster tighter integration between computational modeling and wet-lab experimentation, leading to meaningful advancements."
