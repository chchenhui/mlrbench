        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core problem of the gap between large ML models and lab use, focusing on accessibility and efficiency. It incorporates multiple specific topics mentioned in the call: efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), lab-in-the-loop iterative approaches, uncertainty modeling (Bayesian active learning), knowledge distillation, and accessible cloud methods. The motivation explicitly targets the limitations of compute resources in typical labs and the need for iterative adaptation based on experimental results, matching the workshop's goals precisely."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is clearly articulated and well-defined. The motivation, main components (LoRA, active learning, distillation, cloud interface), and overall workflow (predict, test, update) are explained logically. The goal of democratizing foundation models for labs with modest resources is evident. While the core concept is clear, minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact integration details (e.g., frequency of distillation within the loop, specific Bayesian methods for biological FMs), but these are typical details for a full paper rather than fundamental flaws in clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty through the specific integration of existing techniques to solve a pressing problem. While individual components like LoRA, active learning, knowledge distillation, and lab-in-the-loop systems exist, their combination within a unified framework ('ActiveLoop') tailored for efficient, iterative fine-tuning of *biological foundation models* guided by uncertainty and designed for resource-constrained labs is innovative. The novelty lies in the synergistic system design and its application context, rather than a single groundbreaking algorithm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core ML components rely on established techniques: pre-trained biological foundation models are available, LoRA is a standard efficient fine-tuning method, Bayesian active learning frameworks exist (though application requires care), and knowledge distillation is well-understood. Implementing a cloud interface is a software engineering task. The main challenge lies in the practical integration with wet-lab cycles, as the speed and cost of experiments can vary greatly. However, the proposed computational framework itself is practical and implementable with current technology, aligning with the goal of using modest local GPUs."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it addresses a critical bottleneck in applying advanced AI to biological discovery: the accessibility and adaptability of large foundation models for experimental labs. If successful, ActiveLoop could substantially accelerate hypothesis-driven research by efficiently guiding experiments, reduce computational and experimental costs, and democratize the use of state-of-the-art ML models beyond well-resourced institutions. This potential impact on the pace and breadth of biological discovery is substantial."
