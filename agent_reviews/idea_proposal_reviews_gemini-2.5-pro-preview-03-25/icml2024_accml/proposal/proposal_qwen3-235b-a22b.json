    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task description: bridging the gap between large ML models and practical lab use by focusing on efficiency (LoRA, distillation), accessibility (local GPUs, cloud interface), iterative adaptation (active learning loop), and lab-in-the-loop integration. The methodology directly implements the research idea, combining LoRA, Bayesian active learning, and knowledge distillation. It effectively synthesizes concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review (e.g., resource constraints, adaptation efficiency, feedback integration, uncertainty quantification), citing relevant works appropriately. It explicitly connects its goals to the workshop's themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly states the problem, challenges, and proposed solution. Research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section is well-structured, detailing the pipeline architecture, technical implementations (LoRA, KD, Active Learning) with appropriate mathematical formulations, and the cloud workflow. The experimental evaluation plan is comprehensive, outlining datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Expected outcomes are quantified. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the proposal immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality through the synergistic integration of existing techniques (Low-Rank Adapters, Bayesian Active Learning, Knowledge Distillation) into a cohesive 'ActiveLoop' system tailored for biological foundation models in a lab-in-the-loop setting. While the individual components are not new (as evidenced by the literature review), their specific combination and application to create an efficient, accessible, and iterative workflow for biological discovery represent a fresh approach. The novelty lies in the system architecture and its specific focus on democratizing foundation models for labs with limited resources, distinguishing it from prior work that might focus on only one aspect (e.g., PEFT alone, active learning alone)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established and validated techniques: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Bayesian active learning (using standard methods like MC Dropout for uncertainty and BALD for acquisition), and Knowledge Distillation for model compression. The technical formulations provided are correct and clearly presented. The methodology is well-justified by the cited literature and directly addresses the identified challenges. The experimental evaluation plan is robust, including relevant baselines, metrics, datasets, and ablation studies to validate the approach rigorously."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. The core techniques (LoRA, Active Learning, Knowledge Distillation) are well-understood and have existing implementations. The use of LoRA significantly reduces computational requirements, making fine-tuning on local GPUs (like the proposed AWS g4dn.xlarge) realistic. Knowledge distillation further enhances deployability on modest hardware. Cloud platforms and APIs (Flask/FastAPI) for the interface are standard technologies. Access to pre-trained models (e.g., ESM2) and public datasets (P450, ChEMBL) is generally feasible. While integrating the components and optimizing the active learning loop requires effort, there are no fundamental technical barriers suggesting impracticability. The plan is realistic with clearly defined steps."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in applying advanced AI to biological research: the accessibility and efficiency of large foundation models for experimental labs. By enabling efficient, iterative fine-tuning and experiment guidance on modest hardware, ActiveLoop has the potential to democratize the use of these powerful models, significantly accelerate discovery cycles (as suggested by the protein/antibody examples), and foster tighter integration between computation and experimentation (lab-in-the-loop). The potential contributions to making AI more usable and effective in real-world biological research are substantial."
