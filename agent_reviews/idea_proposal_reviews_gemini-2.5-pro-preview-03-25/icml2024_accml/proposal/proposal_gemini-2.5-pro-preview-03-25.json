    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of the accessibility/efficiency gap for biological FMs highlighted in the workshop call. The proposed 'ActiveLoop' framework faithfully implements the research idea by integrating PEFT (LoRA), Bayesian Active Learning (BAL), and Knowledge Distillation (KD). Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the literature review (resource constraints, adaptation efficiency, feedback integration, uncertainty quantification) using techniques discussed in the reviewed papers (PEFT methods like LoRA, AL strategies, KD, cloud integration). All sections, from introduction to expected outcomes, consistently reinforce the central theme and proposed solution."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the ActiveLoop framework, including the specific algorithms (LoRA, MC Dropout, KD loss), mathematical formulations where appropriate, and the iterative workflow. The experimental design for validation is thorough, outlining tasks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist only at a very granular level (e.g., precise architecture of the student model, exact UI implementation details), which is acceptable at the proposal stage. Overall, the proposal is immediately understandable and leaves little room for misinterpretation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the individual components (PEFT/LoRA, BAL, KD, lab-in-the-loop) exist in the literature, their synergistic integration into a single, cohesive framework ('ActiveLoop') specifically designed to address the accessibility and iterative refinement challenges of biological FMs is novel. The literature review confirms prior work on these components separately or in pairs (e.g., AL for proteins, PEFT for bio FMs), but the proposed three-way combination within an iterative, uncertainty-guided, resource-constrained loop for biological discovery presents a fresh and valuable contribution. The novelty lies in the system architecture and its targeted application rather than inventing fundamentally new algorithms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established and theoretically grounded techniques: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA), Bayesian Active Learning (using MC Dropout for uncertainty approximation, a standard approach), and Knowledge Distillation. The methodological choices are well-justified and appropriate for the stated objectives. The technical formulations provided (LoRA update, BAL approximation, KD loss) are correct and clearly presented. The proposed experimental design is rigorous, including relevant tasks, strong baselines (isolating the contribution of each component), and comprehensive evaluation metrics covering model performance, AL efficiency, computational cost, and distillation effectiveness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It leverages existing, widely adopted open-source libraries (Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT, PyTorch) for core components like FMs, LoRA, and model training. The chosen methods (LoRA, MC Dropout, standard KD) are computationally tractable, especially compared to full fine-tuning, aligning with the goal of accessibility. The resource requirements (single GPU for PEFT) are realistic for many labs. The experimental validation plan uses established benchmark datasets (or simulation based on them), avoiding immediate dependence on extensive new wet-lab experiments for validation. While integrating the components into a seamless loop requires engineering effort, it is well within the scope of a typical ML research project. Risks are identified but appear manageable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly tackles a critical bottleneck in applying cutting-edge AI to biological research: the accessibility and efficiency of large foundation models for labs with limited resources. By aiming to democratize FMs, accelerate the experimental discovery cycle, optimize resource usage (computational and experimental), and bridge the gap between ML and biology, the project has the potential for major advancements. Success would provide a practical, valuable tool for the biological research community, directly aligning with the workshop's central theme and potentially transforming how FMs are used in day-to-day research."
