    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of bridging the gap between large ML models and wet-lab accessibility by focusing on efficiency (LoRA, KD), accessibility (cloud platform, single GPU), iterative adaptation (active learning, asynchronous updates), and lab-in-the-loop integration. It systematically incorporates all elements outlined in the research idea (LoRA, BALD, KD, Cloud) and leverages concepts/addresses challenges identified in the literature review (efficient fine-tuning, active learning, distillation, cloud platforms, resource constraints)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated, the methodology is broken down into logical, detailed steps (including mathematical formulations for LoRA and BALD), and the evaluation plan is comprehensive. The structure is logical, flowing from background to impact. The language is precise and technical. Minor ambiguities are negligible (e.g., specific student architecture details, which are often determined during implementation). The mention of a figure (Figure 1, not provided) suggests visual aids would further enhance clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, primarily through the synergistic integration of existing techniques (LoRA, BALD, KD, Cloud) into a cohesive, end-to-end lab-in-the-loop system specifically designed for biological foundation models. While the individual components are established (as shown in the literature review), their combination to enable iterative, resource-efficient, uncertainty-guided experimental design and model refinement within a user-friendly framework represents a novel system-level contribution. It clearly distinguishes itself from papers focusing on only one aspect (e.g., only PEFT, only active learning)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations and well-established methods: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning, Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) for uncertainty quantification and experiment selection, and Knowledge Distillation (KD) for model compression. The methodology is robust, well-justified, and technically detailed (e.g., LoRA math, BALD approximation). The validation plan using both simulation and real-world collaboration is rigorous. Potential issues like catastrophic forgetting are acknowledged with proposed mitigations (warm-starting, low LR)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core ML techniques (LoRA, BALD, KD) are implementable using standard libraries. The goal of reducing computational requirements (single GPU fine-tuning) enhances feasibility for the target audience. Cloud platform development is standard practice. The main challenges lie in the successful integration of all components into a seamless workflow, securing and managing the wet-lab collaboration effectively, and achieving the specific quantitative efficiency targets (5x GPU, 40% assay reduction). However, the plan is realistic, risks are manageable, and the approach leverages existing technologies."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in modern biological research: the difficulty for typical labs to leverage powerful but resource-intensive foundation models. By aiming to democratize access, reduce experimental costs, and accelerate the discovery cycle through an integrated lab-in-the-loop system, the project has the potential for major advancements in how ML is applied in biology. The expected contributions (open-source tool, validated efficiency gains, real-world application) are substantial and directly align with pressing needs in the field."
