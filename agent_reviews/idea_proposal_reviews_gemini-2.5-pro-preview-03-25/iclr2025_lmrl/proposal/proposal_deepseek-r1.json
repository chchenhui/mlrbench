    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (LMRL workshop goals: multimodal, multiscale, causal, generalizable representations, foundation models, evaluation), the research idea (Causal Graph-Contrast for cross-scale molecule-cell graphs with causal modeling), and the literature review (builds on GCL, MCL, causal representation learning, acknowledges cited challenges). It directly addresses the workshop's key questions regarding data, models, algorithms, and evaluation for meaningful biological representations, particularly focusing on integrating scales and causality."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall framework (data integration, pretraining tasks, evaluation), and significance are clearly presented with a logical structure. The loss functions for masking and contrastive learning are specified. However, some technical details could be refined: the exact method for constructing cross-scale edges between molecular and cellular graphs ('known interactions') and the specifics of cellular subgraph extraction ('linking spatially adjacent regions') are somewhat abstract. Crucially, the 'Counterfactual Augmentation' using SCMs and the corresponding causal loss function are mentioned conceptually but lack detailed explanation on how the SCMs are learned/defined and how the counterfactual graphs are generated, which is a core component."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it leverages existing concepts like graph neural networks, multimodal contrastive learning (Refs 1-4, 6, 8, 9), and causal representation learning (Ref 5, 10), its novelty lies in the specific synthesis: 1) Explicitly integrating molecular (atom-level) and cellular (imaging-based) data into a unified, cross-scale heterogeneous graph. 2) Incorporating causal intervention modeling directly within the self-supervised pretraining loop for these biological graphs, aiming for perturbation-invariant representations. This combination targeting cross-scale causal biological understanding is distinct from the cited works, which often focus on single scales, different modalities, or separate causal inference steps."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, based on established methods like GNNs, masked modeling, and contrastive learning (NT-Xent loss). The use of baselines like MOGCL, HyperGCL, and CausalRep shows awareness of related work. However, the soundness of the causal intervention modeling component is less clear due to lack of detail. Mentioning SCMs is appropriate, but the proposal doesn't specify how these complex models will be constructed or learned from the data, nor does it fully justify if the simple L2 loss between observed and counterfactual embeddings is sufficient to capture causal invariance effectively. This underspecified causal component slightly weakens the overall methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Data availability from public repositories (ChEMBL, JUMP-CP, etc.) is a plus. However, constructing the large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-scale graphs requires sophisticated data engineering. The core challenge lies in implementing the causal intervention modeling: reliably generating counterfactual graph augmentations based on SCMs is non-trivial and computationally intensive. Training such a complex model will demand substantial computational resources (GPU clusters). While ambitious, it seems achievable with sufficient expertise and resources, though the causal modeling aspect carries implementation risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses critical limitations in current biological AI models â€“ the inability to bridge molecular and cellular scales and infer causal mechanisms from observational data, which are key goals highlighted in the LMRL task description. Successfully developing representations that capture cross-scale causal relationships would be a major advancement, enabling more accurate in-silico drug response prediction, perturbation effect simulation, and mechanistic understanding, potentially accelerating drug discovery and progress towards virtual cell models. The potential impact on both fundamental biological understanding and translational applications is substantial."
