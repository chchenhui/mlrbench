    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for general, domain-agnostic defenses effective against diverse and unseen attacks, particularly in few-shot settings with limited clean data. The methodology faithfully implements the core research idea of using cross-modal meta-learning on latent activations. It effectively synthesizes the context from the literature review, acknowledging existing work (including meta-learning for backdoor detection like Refs [6, 10]) while clearly positioning its contribution towards cross-modal generalization, addressing key challenges like domain-specificity and data efficiency highlighted in the review and task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly through the research plan). The methodology is detailed, outlining the meta-learning framework (MAML adaptation), data simulation strategy across CV, NLP, and FL, feature extraction, base detector concept, and the few-shot deployment/calibration process using only clean data. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are comprehensive and unambiguous. The structure is logical, making it easy to follow the proposed research flow from motivation to expected impact."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While meta-learning for backdoor detection has been explored (Refs [6, 10]), this proposal's novelty lies in the specific combination of: 1) Explicitly using *cross-modal* meta-training (CV, NLP, FL) to learn a generalized backdoor signature, 2) Aiming for *domain-agnostic* detection applicable to models/domains potentially unseen during meta-training, and 3) Achieving this under the practical constraint of *few-shot adaptation using only clean data*. This combination distinguishes it from prior work that might focus on single domains or require different adaptation data. It offers a fresh perspective on building universal backdoor defenses."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon the well-established premise that backdoors affect model internals, specifically latent activations. Using the penultimate layer for feature extraction is standard practice. Employing meta-learning (MAML) to learn an adaptable anomaly detector initialization is theoretically sound. The proposed methodology, including the MAML adaptation steps and the few-shot calibration process, is well-defined. The experimental plan is rigorous, including diverse domains, attacks (known/unseen), relevant baselines, ablation studies, and clear metrics. The main assumption needing strong empirical validation is the existence of sufficiently universal backdoor activation patterns across modalities, but the approach to test this is methodologically sound. Technical formulations appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required datasets, model architectures, and computational resources (GPU clusters for meta-training) are standard in ML research. The core technologies (deep learning frameworks, MAML implementations) are available. Simulating diverse backdoor attacks across CV, NLP, and FL requires significant engineering effort but is achievable based on existing literature. The few-shot clean data requirement for deployment significantly enhances practical feasibility. The main risks are the potential computational cost of meta-training and the empirical uncertainty regarding the core hypothesis of generalizable signatures, but these are research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in ML security â€“ the lack of general, data-efficient backdoor defenses, as highlighted in the task description and literature review. A successful outcome would provide a practical, scalable solution for vetting pre-trained models and securing systems in various domains (CV, NLP, FL, potentially others), significantly enhancing ML trustworthiness. Its domain-agnostic and few-shot nature would make robust defense accessible to a wider range of users. It directly tackles key research questions posed by the task description regarding general defenses and cross-domain relationships."
