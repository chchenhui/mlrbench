    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined: the need for domain-agnostic defenses (CV, NLP, FL), adaptation to unseen attacks, and operation with limited clean data, all explicitly mentioned in the task description and literature review's key challenges. The methodology directly implements the research idea of using meta-learning on activation patterns for cross-modal detection. It positions itself clearly against the limitations of existing domain-specific methods identified in the literature (e.g., TextGuard, MetaClean) and aims to tackle emerging threats (e.g., ReVeil, BELT, Universal Backdoors)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology is broken down logically into meta-training and testing phases, with clear steps (attack simulation, activation sampling, anomaly detector, MAML, few-shot calibration, detection). Mathematical formulations for the loss and meta-update are provided. The evaluation protocol is detailed with specific datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Expected outcomes are quantified. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor improvements could include slightly more detail on the anomaly detector architecture (h(z;\\\\phi_i)), but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While meta-learning for backdoor detection has been explored (Refs 6, 10 in the literature review), this proposal's specific focus on achieving *domain-agnostic* generalization across fundamentally different modalities (CV, NLP, FL) using meta-learned *activation anomaly patterns* and *few-shot clean-data calibration* appears novel. It explicitly aims to overcome the domain-specificity limitation highlighted in the literature. The combination of MAML, cross-modal training data, activation analysis, and calibration without trigger examples distinguishes it from prior work focusing on within-domain adaptation or specific attack types."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established techniques like meta-learning (MAML) and anomaly detection. The core idea of identifying backdoors via activation deviations is plausible and has precedent in related work. The methodology is well-structured, and the technical formulations (loss function, MAML update) are correct. The assumptions (detectable activation anomalies across domains, effectiveness of meta-learning for universal patterns, sufficiency of 50 clean samples for calibration) are reasonable research hypotheses that the proposed evaluation plan is designed to test. The use of diverse attack simulations strengthens the meta-training approach. Minor gaps include the precise architecture of the lightweight anomaly detector, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. The required resources (datasets, compute for training/simulation, ML expertise) are standard for ML research. The methodology involves well-understood techniques (attack simulation, feature extraction, MAML, anomaly detection). The most demanding part is the meta-training across diverse tasks, which is computationally intensive but feasible. The key advantage is the low data requirement during testing (few-shot clean data), making deployment practical. The evaluation plan is standard. The main risk lies in achieving the ambitious performance targets, not in the ability to implement the proposed steps."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in ML security: the lack of robust, generalizable backdoor defenses, especially for the widely used pre-trained models and federated learning systems. A successful domain-agnostic, few-shot detector would represent a major advancement over current domain-specific or data-hungry methods. The potential impact on improving trust in AI systems, securing critical applications (healthcare, finance), and informing policy is substantial and clearly articulated. It directly tackles key research questions highlighted in the task description and literature."
