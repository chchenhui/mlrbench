    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for general defense methods against diverse and unseen backdoor attacks across multiple domains (CV, NLP, FL). The proposed MetaShield framework aligns perfectly with the research idea, elaborating on the meta-learning approach for domain-agnostic detection. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles key challenges identified in the literature review, such as domain-specific limitations, adaptability to unseen attacks, and data efficiency, positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology (meta-training, meta-testing, fine-tuning), and expected outcomes are clearly presented. The structure is logical. However, some technical details lack specificity. For instance, the type of 'small anomaly detector' is not defined, the specific meta-learning algorithm for aggregation is not mentioned, and the mathematical formulation is high-level, lacking details on the loss function or the exact optimization process. These omissions create minor ambiguities regarding the precise implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the literature review indicates prior work using meta-learning for backdoor detection (papers 6, 10), this proposal distinguishes itself by explicitly aiming for a *domain-agnostic* detector trained *simultaneously* across diverse modalities (CV, NLP, FL) to learn a *universal* backdoor signature initialization. This cross-modal meta-learning approach for generating a shared initialization, combined with anomaly detection on latent activations, represents a fresh perspective compared to existing domain-specific or purely few-shot adaptation methods. The novelty lies in the synthesis and the specific goal of cross-domain generalization via meta-learned universal irregularities."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, leveraging established techniques like meta-learning and anomaly detection. The methodology follows a logical progression. However, its soundness is weakened by a strong, central assumption: that backdoors induce 'universal irregularities' in latent activations that are consistent and detectable across highly diverse domains like CV, NLP, and FL. This assumption requires significant empirical validation and is not sufficiently justified in the proposal. Additionally, the lack of detail regarding the specific anomaly detection method and meta-learning algorithm makes it difficult to fully assess the technical rigor. The mathematical formulation is too abstract to evaluate its correctness thoroughly."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with adequate resources (diverse datasets, models, compute power). The steps outlined are logical. However, significant technical challenges exist. Simulating realistic and diverse backdoor attacks across CV, NLP, and FL is complex. Ensuring consistent and meaningful latent activation extraction across varied architectures and domains can be difficult. The effectiveness hinges on the unproven assumption of universal backdoor signatures in latent space. Meta-learning itself can be challenging to implement and tune effectively, especially across disparate domains. Fine-tuning with only a 'handful' of clean samples might be insufficient for robust calibration in practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical gap in current ML security: the lack of robust, generalizable backdoor defenses that work across different domains and adapt to new threats with minimal data. Success would represent a major advancement, providing a practical 'plug-and-play' defense mechanism crucial for securing pre-trained models and systems using user data. It directly tackles key questions raised in the task description and has the potential to significantly enhance the trustworthiness of ML systems."
