    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses several key questions posed in the workshop aims, specifically regarding the similarities/differences of attacks across domains, measuring stealthiness/practicality, evaluating/adapting existing defenses across domains, and developing general defense methods. The focus on CV, NLP, and FL aligns perfectly with the domains mentioned in the task description. The motivation and goals resonate strongly with the workshop's emphasis on the need for cross-domain understanding and more robust, general defenses against backdoor attacks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-defined, explaining the gap in current research. The main idea is broken down into four logical and understandable steps (pattern identification, cross-domain defense development, evaluation, general framework development). The expected outcomes and potential impact are clearly articulated. While specific algorithms aren't detailed (as expected for an idea summary), the overall research plan, scope (CV, NLP, FL), and objectives are unambiguous and easy to grasp."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses good novelty. While research on backdoor attacks and defenses exists within individual domains like CV, NLP, and FL, the task description explicitly notes that the connection *between* domains is largely unexplored. The core novelty lies in the systematic cross-domain analysis to identify commonalities/differences and leveraging these insights to develop adaptable or general defenses. Evaluating existing defenses across domains and aiming for a general defense framework grounded in this cross-domain understanding offers a fresh perspective, addressing a recognized gap in the literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Identifying patterns requires access to diverse datasets, models, and attack implementations across multiple domains, which is achievable but resource-intensive. Developing and evaluating defenses across domains is standard research practice but requires significant computational resources and careful experimental design, potentially needing new cross-domain benchmarks. Developing a truly *general* defense framework is ambitious, as acknowledged by the difficulty stated in the task description, but pursuing *more* general defenses based on cross-domain insights is a practical research goal. Overall, it's feasible within a well-resourced research setting."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance and potential impact. Backdoor attacks are a critical threat, especially for widely used pre-trained models, as highlighted in the task description. Bridging the gap in cross-domain understanding could lead to fundamental insights into backdoor vulnerabilities. Developing adaptable or general defenses would be a major advancement, potentially enhancing the security and trustworthiness of ML systems across various important applications (CV, NLP, FL). Success in this research could significantly contribute to mitigating backdoor risks in real-world AI deployments."
