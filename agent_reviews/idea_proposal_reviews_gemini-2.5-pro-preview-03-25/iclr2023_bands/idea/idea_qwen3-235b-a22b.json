        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core problem highlighted: the lack of general, cross-domain backdoor defenses effective against diverse and unseen attacks. The idea explicitly targets CV, NLP, and FL, domains mentioned in the task, and proposes a solution for the key question of developing a general defense method. It also aligns with topics like detecting/eliminating backdoors under constraints (no clean data, limited model access) and aims for real-world applicability, which are central themes of the task description."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (trigger-insensitive representation learning), and main steps (manifold analysis, self-supervised filter, adversarial RL, data-free distillation) are presented logically. The goals and evaluation metrics (≥90% detection, <5% accuracy drop) are specific. However, some technical details lack full elaboration, such as the precise method for identifying sensitive manifolds, the specifics of the score-based RL formulation, and the exact data-free distillation pipeline. Minor ambiguities exist regarding how these complex components integrate seamlessly, requiring some refinement for perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. The central concept of learning trigger-insensitive *representations* via a self-supervised filter network, rather than focusing solely on trigger detection or model patching, offers a fresh perspective. The proposed combination of techniques – analyzing activation manifolds for vulnerability, using adversarial minimization of sensitivity, employing score-based RL for tuning the filter, and integrating data-free distillation – appears to be a novel synthesis for backdoor defense. While individual components exist, their application and integration in this specific context (cross-domain, data-free defense) are innovative compared to existing domain-specific or trigger-specific defenses."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Identifying subtle backdoor-related manifolds across diverse domains and architectures reliably is difficult. Training the filter network involves a complex optimization landscape combining self-supervision, adversarial objectives, and reinforcement learning, which can be unstable and hard to tune. Score-based RL is known for its sample complexity. Data-free distillation might not perfectly preserve model utility or could be complex to implement effectively across domains. Integrating these advanced techniques into a robust, working pipeline requires considerable research effort and may face unforeseen obstacles. The ambition level makes feasibility a notable concern."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully developing a general, cross-domain backdoor defense that operates without clean data, direct model modification access (initially), or specific attack knowledge would be a major breakthrough in AI security. It addresses a critical limitation of current defenses and tackles a growing threat landscape, especially for large pre-trained models used in sensitive applications (as highlighted in the task description). Achieving the target performance would provide a valuable tool for certifying and securing AI systems, potentially setting a new standard for robust defenses."
