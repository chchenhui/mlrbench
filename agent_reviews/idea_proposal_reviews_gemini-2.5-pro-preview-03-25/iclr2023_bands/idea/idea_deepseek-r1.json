    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research into general defense methods against diverse backdoor attacks, exploring cross-domain similarities/differences, and adapting defenses across domains like CV, NLP, and FL. The proposed 'LTSan' method directly addresses this by aiming for a unified, cross-domain defense framework operating in the feature space, specifically targeting CV, NLP, and FL. It aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of improving ML security, particularly for widely used pre-trained models, and directly tackles the question of developing general defense methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, the core concept of LTSan, its two phases (Latent Trigger Discovery via contrastive learning and Model Sanitization via pruning/finetuning), and the evaluation plan are clearly presented. The mechanism of focusing on feature-space anomalies for cross-domain generalization is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of generating 'poisoned data proxies' for contrastive learning and how triggers are synthesized from discovered patterns for adversarial finetuning, but the overall research direction and methodology are well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual techniques like contrastive learning, feature analysis, neuron pruning, and adversarial training exist, their synthesis into a unified framework (LTSan) specifically designed for *cross-domain* backdoor defense by operating purely in the latent feature space is innovative. Most defenses are domain-specific. Using contrastive learning to identify modality-agnostic trigger signatures in the feature space and combining this with targeted pruning and adversarial finetuning offers a fresh perspective on building generalizable defenses. It's a novel application and combination of existing concepts to address a challenging problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core technical components (contrastive learning, feature clustering, neuron pruning, adversarial finetuning) are established ML techniques. Standard datasets and models exist for evaluation across CV, NLP, and FL. However, some implementation challenges exist: reliably generating or obtaining 'poisoned data proxies' needed for the contrastive learning phase without prior trigger knowledge requires careful design. Synthesizing effective triggers from discovered latent patterns for the adversarial finetuning phase might also be complex. While achievable with current technology, successful implementation requires careful engineering and validation, particularly for the trigger discovery and synthesis steps."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. The task description emphasizes the critical threat of backdoors, especially in widely deployed pre-trained models, and the limitations of current domain-specific defenses. A successful cross-domain defense mechanism like LTSan would address a major security vulnerability in modern AI systems. Improving backdoor mitigation by 20-40% across diverse domains like CV, NLP, and FL, as targeted, would represent a substantial advancement in ML trustworthiness and security, directly impacting real-world applications relying on these models."
