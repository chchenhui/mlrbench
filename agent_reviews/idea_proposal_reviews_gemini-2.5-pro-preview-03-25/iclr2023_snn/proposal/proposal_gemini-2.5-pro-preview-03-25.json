    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the task (sustainability, hardware limitations for sparse training, efficiency, trade-offs) by proposing a hardware-software co-design solution (ACF) outlined in the research idea. The introduction explicitly motivates the work based on the computational/energy costs of large DNNs and the shortcomings of current hardware (GPUs) for sparsity, echoing the task description. The proposed solution and objectives directly stem from the research idea. The methodology incorporates concepts and addresses challenges identified in the literature review (e.g., referencing Procrustes/TensorDash as potential baselines, tackling irregular memory access, co-design complexity). The significance section explicitly links the expected outcomes to the task's focus areas like sustainability and hardware advancements."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to a specific solution, detailed objectives, a phased methodology, and expected outcomes/impact. The language is precise and technical concepts (adaptive compute units, sparse memory subsystem, reconfigurable interconnect, co-designed algorithms, sparse formats like CSR/CSC) are explained well. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) within the context of the proposal's timeline. The methodology section provides substantial detail on each phase, including technical formulations (sparse MAC equation) and a clear evaluation plan with defined baselines, metrics, models, and datasets. There is very little ambiguity about what is proposed and how it will be pursued."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While hardware acceleration for sparse networks (including training, e.g., Procrustes [1], TensorDash [2]) and hardware-software co-design are existing concepts, the proposed ACF architecture introduces specific novel elements. The key novelty lies in the combination of *adaptive* compute units, a sparse-aware memory subsystem explicitly designed for *dynamic training updates*, and a *reconfigurable* interconnect, all working in concert and tightly co-designed with algorithms to handle *dynamic sparsity patterns* evolving during training. This focus on runtime adaptivity across compute, memory, and communication tailored for the dynamics of sparse training appears distinct from the cited works, which might focus on specific dataflows, input sparsity exploitation, or inference. The proposal clearly articulates this gap and positions the ACF as a more holistic and adaptive solution for sparse training."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations regarding the benefits of sparsity and the limitations of current hardware. The proposed architectural concepts (zero-skipping, sparse memory controllers, NoCs) are well-established in computer architecture. The methodology employs a standard and rigorous phased approach, including cycle-accurate simulation (appropriate for architecture research) and integration with standard DL frameworks. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, comparing against relevant baselines (dense GPU, sparse GPU software, potentially prior accelerators) using appropriate metrics. The technical formulations provided are correct. Minor weaknesses include the inherent difficulty in accurately modeling power consumption in simulation and the potential complexity of ensuring the co-designed algorithms perfectly map to the adaptive hardware features without excessive overhead."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Designing a novel adaptive architecture, developing co-designed algorithms, building and validating a cycle-accurate simulator integrated with PyTorch/TensorFlow, and conducting extensive experiments is a very ambitious scope for 24 months. Cycle-accurate simulation of complex systems is notoriously slow, potentially limiting the scale of models (acknowledged for BERT) and the number of experiments. Integrating the simulator with DL frameworks requires substantial engineering effort. Designing effective runtime control for the reconfigurable interconnect is complex. Achieving the targeted 3-10x speedups and 5-15x energy savings over highly optimized GPU baselines is challenging. While simulation avoids physical prototyping costs, the overall complexity makes the plan demanding, requiring significant expertise and resources. The feasibility is plausible within a well-equipped research setting but carries notable risks regarding the timeline and achieving the full scope."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses the critical and timely problem of the high computational cost and energy consumption of training large DNNs, a major concern for AI sustainability highlighted in the task description. Efficient sparse training is a key research direction, and the limitations of current hardware are a major bottleneck. If successful, the proposed ACF could offer substantial improvements in training speed and energy efficiency, potentially lowering the barrier to entry for large-scale AI research, reducing the environmental impact, and enabling the development of even larger models. The research would also provide valuable insights into hardware-software co-design for sparsity and inform future accelerator designs beyond GPUs. The potential impact on both the scientific community and the broader goal of sustainable AI is substantial."
