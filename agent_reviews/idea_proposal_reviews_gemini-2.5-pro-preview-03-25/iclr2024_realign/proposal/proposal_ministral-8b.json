        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem outlined in the workshop task (developing robust, generalizable cross-domain alignment metrics) and elaborates on the specific research idea (using invariant feature spaces learned via domain adaptation). The methodology explicitly incorporates techniques (adversarial/contrastive learning) highlighted in the literature review. It tackles key workshop questions regarding shared strategies, advancing metrics, generalization, and intervention possibilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, significance, and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The methodology follows a logical multi-stage structure with distinct algorithmic steps. However, some details could be more specific, such as the exact formulation of the 'domain-agnostic alignment metric' beyond mentioning distance calculations, and the specific datasets envisioned for collection. The connection between the extracted 'invariant features' and the final metric calculation could be slightly more explicit. Overall, it is well-structured and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the techniques used (domain adaptation, contrastive learning, adversarial training, PCA, autoencoders) are established, their application to specifically create an *invariant feature space* for the purpose of *quantifying representational alignment* between highly disparate domains like biological (fMRI) and artificial (DNNs/LLMs) systems is innovative. It moves beyond using domain adaptation solely for task performance improvement towards using it as a tool for comparative analysis of representations themselves. The novelty lies in this specific synthesis and application context, addressing limitations of existing alignment methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established concepts of representational alignment and domain adaptation. The proposed methodology leverages well-understood techniques (adversarial training, contrastive learning, dimensionality reduction) relevant to the problem, as supported by the literature review. The plan to validate the metric using behavioral congruence is a standard and appropriate approach in this interdisciplinary area. While technical formulations aren't detailed, the described methods are technically sound. The main assumption is that domain adaptation can effectively learn a functionally meaningful invariant space, which is plausible but requires empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required data types (fMRI, electrophysiology, network activations) exist, although curating diverse and corresponding datasets might require significant effort or collaboration. The proposed machine learning techniques (domain adaptation, autoencoders, PCA) are standard and implementable with existing libraries and computational resources (though potentially demanding). Validation through behavioral congruence depends on accessing paired representational and behavioral data. The primary challenge lies in successfully training the domain adaptation models to yield meaningful invariant spaces across potentially very different modalities, but the overall plan is realistic for a research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and acknowledged gap in comparing representations across biological and artificial systems, a central theme of the workshop task. Developing a robust, domain-agnostic alignment metric would be a major contribution, enabling deeper understanding of shared computational principles, informing AI safety (value alignment), and potentially guiding the development of AI systems that better integrate with human data or biological constraints. Success would have substantial implications for machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science."
