    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the Re-Align workshop (when/why systems learn aligned representations, how to intervene) by proposing a novel method (RIFE) to measure alignment across diverse domains and explicitly including an intervention study (Experiment 4). It tackles most of the specific questions posed by the workshop, such as developing robust cross-domain metrics, investigating shared computational strategies, and exploring how to modify alignment. The proposal accurately reflects and significantly expands upon the provided research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology (invariant spaces via domain adaptation), validation strategy, and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates concepts from the literature review, citing the use of contrastive-adversarial techniques (similar to CDA), addressing the challenge of false negatives in contrastive learning (mentioned in Thota et al. and Wang et al.), and aiming to overcome key challenges like data modality differences."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure with distinct sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly listed and unambiguous. The proposed RIFE framework, including the two-stage adversarial and contrastive learning approach, is explained in detail with supporting mathematical formulations for the loss functions. The experimental design is well-articulated, outlining specific system pairs, stimuli, and analyses for validation. The rationale for the approach and the significance of the research are clearly communicated. While minor implementation details (e.g., specific network architectures for feature extractors) are omitted, this is appropriate for a proposal, and the overall concept and plan are immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the constituent techniques (adversarial domain adaptation, contrastive learning) are established methods (as evidenced by the literature review), their specific combination and application to the problem of measuring representational alignment *between* highly disparate systems like biological brains (fMRI) and artificial neural networks (DNNs) is novel. Existing alignment methods (RSA, CCA) often fail in such cross-domain scenarios. The core novelty lies in leveraging domain adaptation not just for task transfer but specifically for creating a shared embedding space to quantify representational similarity itself. The proposal clearly distinguishes its approach from prior work by tackling the cross-domain challenge directly and aiming to link alignment scores to behavioral congruence and enable interventions."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations in machine learning, particularly domain adaptation and contrastive learning. The proposed two-stage methodology (adversarial alignment followed by contrastive refinement) is logical and well-motivated for achieving both global distribution alignment and local structure preservation. The mathematical formulations for the loss functions are standard and appear correct. The inclusion of techniques to mitigate false negatives in contrastive learning demonstrates methodological rigor. The primary assumption – that a meaningful invariant feature space capturing functional equivalence can be learned across such different systems – is ambitious but a core research question worth investigating. The proposed alignment measures in the shared space are appropriate. The overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Implementing adversarial and contrastive learning models is standard practice in machine learning. The required computational resources are significant but generally available in research labs. Accessing the necessary data (fMRI recordings, DNN activations) is plausible, either through public datasets or collaborations, although potentially challenging. The experimental plan is ambitious, involving multiple comparisons and an intervention study, but it is well-structured and broken down into manageable parts. Key risks include the difficulty in obtaining perfectly matched stimuli across domains and the potential instability or difficulty in optimizing the combined adversarial-contrastive training, but these are typical research challenges rather than fundamental flaws, appearing manageable with careful execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and critical problem at the intersection of neuroscience, AI, and cognitive science – how to compare representations across fundamentally different intelligent systems. This directly aligns with the core challenges highlighted in the workshop description. Success would provide a much-needed tool for understanding shared computational principles, potentially leading to major advancements in biologically inspired AI, interpretability, and theories of cognition. The expected contributions, including a validated framework, empirical insights into alignment patterns, and potential practical applications (model design, BCIs, evaluation metrics), are substantial and clearly articulated. The research has strong potential to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and advance the quest for a unifying theory of intelligence."
