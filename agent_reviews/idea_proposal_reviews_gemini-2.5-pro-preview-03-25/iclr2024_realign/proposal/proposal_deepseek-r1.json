    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task (comparing bio/AI representations, developing robust metrics, understanding shared principles, enabling interventions). The methodology leverages the techniques mentioned in the research idea (invariant spaces via adversarial/contrastive learning) and explicitly builds upon the methods and addresses the challenges identified in the literature review (CDA, false negatives, pseudo-labeling for unsupervised DA, modality differences, class shifts). The objectives, validation plan, and expected outcomes all map directly onto the goals stated in the task description and research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, the background provides strong motivation, and the methodology section logically outlines the proposed framework with specific components (adversarial loss, contrastive loss, pseudo-labeling), including mathematical formulations and references. The experimental validation plan (datasets, tasks, metrics, baselines) is clearly described. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor details, such as the specific architecture for the feature extractor F, are omitted, but this is typical for a proposal and does not detract significantly from the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the core concepts of adversarial domain adaptation and contrastive learning are established, the novelty lies in their specific synthesis and application to the challenging cross-domain (biological vs. artificial intelligence) representational alignment problem. It explicitly integrates recent advancements like two-stage contrastive learning (inspired by CDA) and false negative mitigation (inspired by Thota & Leontidis) into a unified framework tailored for this interdisciplinary task. This specific combination and application focus, aiming for a domain-agnostic metric validated by behavioral congruence, represents a fresh approach compared to standard CCA/RSA or applying individual DA techniques in isolation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in domain adaptation (adversarial learning for domain invariance, contrastive learning for feature structure). The methodology is well-justified by referencing recent state-of-the-art papers from the literature review for specific components like the CDA-inspired contrastive loss and false negative handling. The mathematical formulations presented are standard and appear correct. The main assumption – that a meaningful invariant space can be learned between highly disparate modalities like fMRI/EEG and ANN activations – is strong but represents a key research question the proposal aims to tackle with appropriate methods. Potential challenges like training stability (adversarial) and pseudo-label quality are acknowledged implicitly by using established techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. It relies on publicly available datasets (NSD, Pereira et al.) and standard deep learning techniques (adversarial/contrastive learning) implementable with current hardware. However, the scope is ambitious, involving multiple data modalities (fMRI, EEG, ANN activations), domains (vision, language), and systems (primates, humans, mice, CNNs, LLMs). Successfully implementing and tuning the combined adversarial-contrastive framework across these diverse settings, especially handling potential training instabilities or suboptimal pseudo-labeling, will require significant effort, computational resources, and potentially diverse expertise (ML, neuroscience data processing). The validation involving behavioral congruence adds another layer of complexity."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and critical problem at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science – understanding and comparing representations across different types of intelligences. Developing a robust, domain-agnostic alignment metric would be a major breakthrough, enabling deeper insights into universal computational principles. Success could lead to transformative advancements in AI (interpretability, safety, biologically-inspired design), neuroscience (understanding brain computation), and translational applications like BCIs. The research directly tackles key open questions highlighted in the workshop task description."
