        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses one of the central questions posed in the task description: 'How can we systematically increase (or decrease) representational alignment among biological and artificial systems?'. It proposes a specific method ('Targeted Representational Sculpting') to intervene on alignment, which is a core theme of the workshop. It is perfectly aligned with the workshop's focus on understanding and manipulating representational alignment between different intelligent systems (AI-AI, AI-Bio)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented very clearly. The motivation is well-stated, outlining the limitations of current methods. The core mechanism (using alignment gradients for targeted, low-impact updates) is explained concisely and logically. Key components like differentiable alignment objectives, gradients, and low-rank/sparse updates are mentioned, making the proposed approach understandable. The goal of 'sculpting' alignment while preserving performance is unambiguous. Minor details regarding the exact implementation trade-offs could be further elaborated, but the overall concept is crystal clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While using alignment metrics (like CKA) and gradient-based optimization are established techniques, the novelty lies in the specific application and combination. The idea of using the gradient of an alignment objective *specifically* for targeted, parameter-efficient updates (LoRA, sparse updates) to *sculpt* alignment between *specific layers* while actively minimizing task performance degradation appears innovative. It contrasts with broader methods like joint training or full fine-tuning, offering a potentially more precise and controlled approach to representational intervention. It's a clever synthesis of existing tools for a specific, nuanced goal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposed method is highly feasible using current machine learning frameworks and techniques. Calculating differentiable alignment metrics (like CKA), computing gradients via backpropagation, and applying parameter-efficient updates (like LoRA) are all standard practices. Accessing intermediate layer representations is straightforward in most NN architectures. The main challenge lies in empirically tuning the process to effectively modify alignment without significantly harming task performance, and potentially in obtaining suitable paired data for NN-Brain alignment, but the core technical components are readily available and implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a significant problem in understanding and comparing intelligent systems. If successful, it could provide a much-needed tool for precisely controlling representational similarity. This has strong potential impact in areas like model interpretability (aligning models to probe function), model merging, transfer learning, computational neuroscience (testing brain hypotheses by aligning models to neural data), and potentially even controlling downstream behaviors if they correlate with representation. It offers a more targeted alternative to computationally expensive or disruptive existing methods, potentially enabling new lines of research."
