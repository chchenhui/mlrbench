        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Machine Learning & Global Health' by proposing an ML solution for a critical public health problem (epidemic early warning). It explicitly mentions learning from COVID-19, leveraging ML for pandemic preparedness, addressing challenges in low-resource settings, and incorporating semi-mechanistic modelling â€“ all key points mentioned in the workshop call. It aims to bridge the gap between ML and public health practice by providing actionable insights."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, the problem (limitations of current systems), the proposed solution (multi-modal system with specific components like hierarchical attention, semi-mechanistic architecture, transfer learning), the data sources, the core innovation, and the intended impact (1-2 weeks earlier detection) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The technical concepts are specific enough to understand the direction of the research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using ML, multi-modal data, and various data streams (digital, environmental) for epidemic forecasting exists, the proposed approach combines these elements in a potentially innovative way. The specific novelty lies in the proposed hierarchical attention framework for integrating a wide array of disparate data sources, the integration of a semi-mechanistic architecture to incorporate domain knowledge within this framework, and the targeted use of transfer learning for adapting such a complex system to data-sparse, low-resource settings. It represents a sophisticated synthesis and extension of existing techniques rather than a completely new paradigm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges, primarily related to data. Acquiring, cleaning, integrating, and ensuring timely access to the diverse proposed data streams (epidemiological, search, social media, mobility, wastewater, climate, medication purchases, hospital admissions) across different regions, especially low-resource settings, is extremely challenging due to issues of availability, privacy, cost, standardization, and policy. While the ML techniques (attention, transfer learning, hybrid models) are within the realm of current capabilities, building and validating such a complex integrated system, particularly proving the '1-2 weeks earlier' detection claim reliably across contexts, presents considerable practical hurdles. The model complexity also implies significant computational requirements."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Early detection of epidemic outbreaks is a critical global health challenge with profound implications for public health response, morbidity, mortality, and economic stability, as underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic. Successfully developing a system that provides even a few days, let alone 1-2 weeks, earlier warning could lead to major advancements in pandemic preparedness and response, particularly benefiting vulnerable populations in low-resource settings. The research directly addresses a core goal of the workshop: leveraging ML for proactive global health solutions."
