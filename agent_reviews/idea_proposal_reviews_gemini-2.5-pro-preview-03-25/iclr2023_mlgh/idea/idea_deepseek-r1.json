    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple workshop themes, including the limitations of ML in global health (data silos, privacy) and proposes solutions (FL, DP, incentives), leveraging ML for pandemic preparedness (COVID-19 use case) and health inequalities, and improving data sharing practices. It focuses on a difficult public health problem using relevant ML methods (FL, DP) and aims to bridge the gap between ML advancements and policy needs, which is a core goal of the workshop."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (FL, DP, Incentives), validation approach (COVID-19 data), and expected impact are clearly stated. The specific techniques are identified. Minor ambiguities might exist around the precise implementation details of 'adaptive' differential privacy or the chosen incentive mechanism (Shapley vs. blockchain), but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and incentive mechanisms are existing concepts, their specific integration (FL + DP + Game Theory/Blockchain Incentives) tailored for the challenging context of multi-institutional, cross-border global health data collaboration is innovative. The focus on addressing data sovereignty, equity, and policy relevance within this framework offers a fresh perspective compared to standard FL applications."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. While the core ML techniques (FL, DP) are implementable in principle, integrating them effectively with robust and fair incentive mechanisms (especially complex ones like Shapley value or blockchain across jurisdictions) is difficult. The primary hurdles are non-technical: securing agreements from multiple international health organizations, navigating complex and varied data privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), establishing trust, and ensuring the practical adoption of the incentive system. Validation on existing datasets is more feasible than large-scale deployment."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical barrier in global health research and practice â€“ the inability to securely and effectively leverage fragmented health data across institutions and borders. Successfully implementing such a framework could lead to major advancements in pandemic prediction/response, resource allocation, and understanding health inequalities. It directly addresses the workshop's call for ML solutions to major global health challenges with policy relevance."
