        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key themes of the workshop: leveraging machine learning to be proactive against future pandemics, tackling the limitations of current ML models in global health (lack of transparency), and aiming to bridge the gap between ML advances and policymakers. It fits squarely within the intersection of ML and global health, specifically epidemiology and public health, and implicitly relates to disease transmission modeling. The focus on explainability for policymakers is highly relevant to the workshop's goal of facilitating communication and assessing the applicability of ML methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main idea, proposed methodology (including specific ML and XAI techniques), evaluation steps, and expected outcomes are clearly outlined. The goal of combining predictive power with interpretability is well-defined. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific scope of 'global' data or the exact nature of the user studies for interpretability evaluation, but the core concept is presented with good clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. While applying machine learning to pandemic prediction and using XAI techniques like LIME/SHAP are established practices, the specific focus on integrating these for *global health surveillance* with an explicit goal of enhancing *policymaker trust and actionability* provides a relevant contribution. It addresses a known gap (interpretability in high-stakes public health decisions) rather than introducing a fundamentally new ML technique or theoretical concept. The novelty lies in the specific application context and the emphasis on the human-interpretable aspect for a particular user group (policymakers)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. The ML model development (RF, GB, NN) and application of XAI techniques (LIME, SHAP) are technically feasible. However, gathering comprehensive, reliable, and timely global data on disease outbreaks, demographics, and environmental factors is a major challenge due to data heterogeneity, availability, privacy concerns, and potential biases. Furthermore, conducting meaningful user studies with policymakers to evaluate interpretability requires significant logistical effort and access. Building a robust, user-friendly deployment platform also requires considerable resources. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation, especially data acquisition and rigorous evaluation, poses significant hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Improving pandemic prediction and preparedness is a critical global health challenge, underscored by recent events. Addressing the 'black box' problem of ML models in this domain is crucial for their adoption and effective use by decision-makers. Enhancing trust and providing actionable insights through explainability could lead to more timely and effective public health interventions, potentially saving lives and mitigating the socio-economic impact of pandemics. The research directly tackles a key barrier to translating ML advances into real-world public health benefits."
