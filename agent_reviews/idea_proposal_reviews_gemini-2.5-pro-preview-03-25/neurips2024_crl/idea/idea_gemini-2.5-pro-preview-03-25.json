        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme by proposing a method to improve causal reasoning in LLMs, explicitly mentioning the use of CRL techniques as one way to infer causal structures. It fits squarely within the listed topic 'Applications of causal representation learning... in LLMs' and touches upon 'Causal Foundation Models' by aiming to enhance LLMs. The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's premise that current deep models capture dependencies but lack causal understanding. While the primary focus is on *using* causal knowledge rather than *learning* causal representations from scratch, its application and potential integration with CRL methods make it highly relevant."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (LLMs' deficiency in causal reasoning), the main proposal (fine-tuning with causal structure), the methodology (using existing/inferred graphs, specific tasks, augmented loss), and the expected outcome (improved causal performance and robustness) are all clearly articulated and easy to understand. There are minor points that could be elaborated (e.g., specific CRL techniques, exact loss formulation), but the overall concept and approach are defined with high precision and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While fine-tuning LLMs and exploring their causal reasoning abilities are active research areas, the proposed method of explicitly incorporating causal structural knowledge (either pre-existing or inferred via CRL) directly into the fine-tuning process via specific tasks and an augmented loss function is innovative. It moves beyond standard fine-tuning or simple prompting, offering a structured way to imbue LLMs with causal understanding derived from external knowledge or CRL methods. This specific combination represents a fresh approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. LLMs are available for fine-tuning, and datasets for causal reasoning tasks can be created or adapted. Causal graphs exist for certain domains. The main challenges lie in: 1) Obtaining accurate and comprehensive causal graphs, especially for complex domains. 2) The effectiveness and scalability of CRL techniques for inferring reliable causal structures from text if existing graphs are unavailable. 3) The significant computational resources required for fine-tuning large models. 4) Designing an effective loss term that correctly penalizes inconsistency with the causal structure. Despite these challenges, the core components are implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Improving the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs is a critical challenge with substantial potential impact. LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, and their inability to reliably distinguish correlation from causation limits their trustworthiness and utility. Success in this research could lead to more robust, reliable, and interpretable LLMs, enabling safer deployment in areas like medicine, policy-making, and scientific discovery. It directly addresses a fundamental limitation of current state-of-the-art AI models."
