        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the Causal Representation Learning workshop, such as CRL models, causal discovery with latent variables, and causal generative models. It faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the concept of Causal Diffusion Models (CDMs). Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review (e.g., latent causal discovery, confounders) while positioning itself relative to recent works like DeCaFlow and CausalBGM by proposing a novel integration within the diffusion framework."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It has a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Outcomes). The research objectives are explicitly stated. The core concepts (SCM, causal discovery module, integration into diffusion) are explained, and mathematical formulations are provided for key components like the SCM and loss functions. The experimental design is well-defined with datasets, baselines, and metrics. Minor ambiguities might exist in the precise implementation details of the causal masking or the function approximation for the consistency loss, but overall, the proposal is easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While causal representation learning and causal generative models are existing fields (as shown in the literature review), the specific idea of integrating causal discovery and enforcing causal constraints *within* the iterative denoising steps of diffusion models is novel. This approach leverages the unique structure of diffusion models differently from existing VAE or Flow-based causal models (like C2VAE, DeCaFlow). The proposed mechanisms, like causal masking during denoising and the causal consistency loss tied to the diffusion steps, represent a fresh perspective on building causality into generative processes."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established foundations like diffusion models, SCMs, and causal discovery principles. The proposed methodology, combining causal graph learning with modifications to the diffusion reverse process (masking, consistency loss), is theoretically plausible. However, the inherent difficulty of accurate causal discovery in latent spaces, especially without guaranteed identifiability or sufficient interventional data, poses a challenge to the robustness of the inferred graph G. Ensuring the proposed causal constraints effectively guide the diffusion process without detrimental effects on generation quality requires careful validation. The technical formulations are generally correct, but the practical effectiveness of enforcing the SCM within the high-dimensional, iterative denoising process needs empirical proof."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. Implementing the causal discovery module and integrating it into the diffusion training pipeline requires significant expertise in both areas. Training diffusion models is computationally intensive, and adding causal components will likely increase this cost. Access to suitable datasets, particularly those amenable to causal analysis or with potential for intervention (even simulated), is crucial. While the evaluation plan uses standard metrics, assessing counterfactual accuracy on real-world data can be difficult. The main risks involve the difficulty of reliable latent causal discovery and balancing causal accuracy with generative quality, but these are acknowledged, and the plan seems generally realistic for a research project with adequate resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current state-of-the-art generative models (diffusion models) â€“ their inability to distinguish correlation from causation, which hinders trustworthiness and controllability. Successfully developing CDMs could lead to major advancements in reliable AI for sensitive domains like healthcare (e.g., controllable medical image synthesis, understanding disease mechanisms) and fairness (mitigating bias). It directly contributes to the advancement of causal representation learning and causal generative models, aligning with the goals of the workshop. The long-term vision of Causal Foundation Models further underscores its potential impact."
