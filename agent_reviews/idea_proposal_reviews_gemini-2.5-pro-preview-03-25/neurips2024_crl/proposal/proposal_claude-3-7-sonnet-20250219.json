    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of Causal Representation Learning (CRL), causal generative models, latent variable discovery, and applications mentioned in the task description. It elaborates comprehensively on the research idea of Causal Diffusion Models (CDMs), detailing the integration of causal graphs into diffusion latent spaces. Furthermore, it situates the work within the context of recent literature (e.g., causal generative models like VAEs/Flows) and explicitly aims to tackle key challenges identified (latent variable identification, interpretability, robustness), demonstrating a deep understanding of the context and prior work. The proposed methodology directly targets the creation of a 'causal generative model' operating on latent variables, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from motivation and objectives to detailed methodology and expected impact. Research objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology section breaks down the complex approach into understandable components (latent discovery, causally-aware diffusion, intervention, evaluation) with clear explanations and relevant mathematical formulations. The evaluation plan is specific regarding datasets and metrics. There is minimal ambiguity, making the proposal immediately understandable and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While causal representation learning and generative models are active research areas (as shown in the literature review), the specific idea of embedding an *explicitly discovered causal graph* into the *latent space of a diffusion model* and modifying the *denoising process* to respect this structure appears novel. Combining VAE-based disentanglement, score-based causal discovery, and a causally-structured diffusion process represents a fresh approach compared to existing causal VAEs or Flow models cited. The proposed interventional sampling mechanism within this framework also adds to the novelty. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it builds on existing components, but the specific synthesis and application to diffusion models are innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations from diffusion models, variational autoencoders, disentanglement techniques, and causal discovery (specifically score-based methods with differentiable constraints). The proposed methodology, including the two-phase causal discovery and the causally-aware diffusion process (conditioning on parents, causal consistency loss), is logically constructed and technically plausible. Mathematical formulations are standard and correctly applied in context. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and includes appropriate metrics for validation. Minor weaknesses might lie in the strong assumptions about the ability to perfectly disentangle and discover the 'true' latent causal graph and the potential unforeseen interactions between the causal constraints and the diffusion process quality, but the overall approach is well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Integrating VAEs, differentiable causal discovery, and diffusion models into a single framework requires substantial engineering effort and computational resources (GPU time). Training stability and balancing the multiple objectives (reconstruction, disentanglement, causal discovery, diffusion loss) could be difficult. Modifying the core diffusion sampling process needs careful implementation and validation. While the components exist, their seamless integration and optimization are non-trivial. Evaluation, particularly of counterfactuals and intervention accuracy, requires careful experimental design. The project is ambitious but achievable with the right expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations of state-of-the-art diffusion models – lack of interpretability, controllability based on causal factors, and susceptibility to spurious correlations. By aiming to integrate causal reasoning, the research has the potential to lead to major advancements in trustworthy AI, particularly for generative models. The potential benefits – enhanced controllability, robustness, interpretability, bias mitigation, and counterfactual reasoning – are substantial. Applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare (medical imaging) and scientific discovery further underscore the potential impact. Success would represent a significant step towards more reliable and understandable AI systems."
