    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on evaluating LLM cognitive abilities (planning, ToM), comparing different architectures (fine-tuned vs. augmented, referencing Cross et al.), and improving evaluation methods. The proposal meticulously elaborates on the core research idea of a Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB), detailing its mechanisms for adaptive difficulty and emergence tracking. Furthermore, it explicitly incorporates insights and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as the need for adaptive benchmarking, understanding emergence (Dong et al.), evaluating ToM (Li et al.), and the importance of human validation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section is particularly strong, providing a detailed breakdown of the DCB framework, the specific parameters for planning and ToM domains, the adaptive task sampling algorithm (including a mathematical formulation), performance tracking methods, and the human validation protocol. The experimental design and expected outcomes are also clearly laid out. The structure is logical and easy to follow, with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While curriculum learning and benchmarking are established concepts, the core idea of a *dynamic* curriculum benchmark that *adaptively generates* tasks based on LLM performance specifically for *emergent cognitive abilities* like planning and ToM is novel. Using reinforcement learning/bandit algorithms for adaptive task sampling within this evaluation framework is a fresh methodological approach. Defining and quantifying emergence thresholds via this dynamic process offers a new way to characterize LLM capabilities beyond static pass/fail rates. It clearly distinguishes itself from static benchmarks and offers a more nuanced evaluation than existing approaches mentioned (like CogBench, which focuses more broadly on cognitive dynamics)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in relevant literature on LLM capabilities, cognitive science concepts (planning, ToM), and machine learning techniques (RL, bandits). The proposed methodology, including parameterized difficulty, adaptive sampling, emergence threshold definition, and metrics (CGI, CTI), is logical and well-justified. The inclusion of a detailed human-in-the-loop validation protocol significantly strengthens the rigor. Minor weaknesses include the potential difficulty in perfectly parameterizing task difficulty across diverse contexts and the need for empirical validation of the specific RL update rule proposed. However, the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, but presents significant engineering and resource challenges. Implementing robust task generators for complex cognitive domains, ensuring the adaptive RL sampler works effectively across the difficulty spectrum, accessing and evaluating a diverse range of LLMs, and managing the human validation workload are demanding tasks. While the individual components (LLM APIs, RL algorithms, task templating) exist, integrating them into a reliable and scalable DCB requires considerable effort and computational resources. The plan is generally realistic, but the risks associated with task generation quality and validation scalability are notable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged limitation in current LLM evaluation methodologies â€“ the reliance on static benchmarks, which fail to capture the nuanced emergence of cognitive abilities. Developing a DCB would provide a much deeper understanding of how capabilities like planning and ToM develop with scale, training, and architecture. It offers a rigorous way to compare different approaches (e.g., fine-tuning vs. modular augmentation like 'Hypothetical Minds'), potentially guiding future LLM development and contributing to AI safety by better characterizing advanced capabilities. The potential contribution to evaluation standards and interdisciplinary understanding is substantial."
