    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on LLM cognitive abilities (planning, ToM), the need for improved benchmarks, and the comparison between fine-tuned and augmented models. The methodology precisely follows the research idea's concept of a Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB) with adaptive difficulty and RL-based task sampling. It also explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as adaptive benchmarking and emergence identification."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, significance, and overall methodology (DCB components, evaluation metrics, algorithmic steps) are articulated well with a logical structure. The core concept of the DCB is easy to grasp. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific RL algorithm for task difficulty scaling and the precise operational definition for estimating 'emergence points' from performance trajectories, but these are acceptable omissions at the proposal stage. Overall, the proposal is highly understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While curriculum learning and RL are existing concepts, applying them to create a dynamic, adaptive benchmark specifically designed to probe the *emergence thresholds* of cognitive skills like planning and ToM in LLMs is innovative. It distinguishes itself from static benchmarks and existing work like CogBench (which focuses on lifelong dynamics) by emphasizing performance-based difficulty scaling for identifying emergence points. The integration of RL for task sampling within this specific benchmarking context adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on established concepts (curriculum learning, RL, cognitive tasks) and relevant literature. The proposed methodology, including task generation, performance monitoring, adaptive progression, and human-in-the-loop validation, is logical and well-justified. Including human validation significantly strengthens the rigor by addressing potential limitations of automated scoring for complex cognitive tasks. While details on the RL implementation and emergence point estimation could be more specific, the overall approach is technically plausible and well-reasoned. The citation with the year 2025 appears to be a typo but doesn't fundamentally undermine the soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. It requires expertise in LLMs, RL, cognitive science, and benchmark design, along with computational resources and potentially human annotators. Designing diverse tasks with fine-grained difficulty scaling for complex cognitive abilities like ToM is non-trivial. Implementing and tuning the RL-based task sampler effectively requires careful engineering. Coordinating human-in-the-loop validation adds logistical complexity. However, these challenges are manageable within a well-resourced research setting, making the project ambitious but achievable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the inadequacy of static benchmarks for evaluating the emergent cognitive capabilities of LLMs. Developing the DCB could lead to major advancements in how LLM cognition is understood, measured, and compared. Identifying emergence thresholds and comparing different architectures (fine-tuned vs. augmented) provides substantial contributions directly relevant to the workshop themes and the broader AI community. The potential impact on guiding the development of more capable and interpretable LLMs is high."
