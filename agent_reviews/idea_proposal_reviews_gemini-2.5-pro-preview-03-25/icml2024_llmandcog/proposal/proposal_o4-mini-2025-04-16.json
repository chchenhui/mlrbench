    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on evaluating LLM cognitive abilities (planning, navigation, ToM), comparing different LLM types (fine-tuned vs. augmented), and improving evaluation benchmarks. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB) concept. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges the limitations of prior work identified in the literature review (static benchmarks, difficulty in pinpointing emergence) and proposes solutions to the key challenges (adaptive benchmarking, emergence identification, human validation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step description of the DCB, including task generation, difficulty parameterization, the multi-armed bandit approach for curriculum sampling (with formulas), emergence point estimation, human auditing, experimental design, and evaluation metrics. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality and innovation. While adaptive testing and curriculum learning are not new concepts in general, their application to create a dynamic benchmark specifically for emergent cognitive skills (planning, navigation, ToM) in LLMs, using a multi-armed bandit for adaptive difficulty scaling, is novel. The focus on precisely quantifying emergence thresholds using this adaptive framework, and comparing different LLM architectures (vanilla, fine-tuned, modular) on this dynamic benchmark, represents a significant advancement over existing static evaluation suites (like CogBench mentioned in the literature) or specific agent evaluations. The combination of these elements constitutes a fresh and valuable approach in the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations, employing established techniques like multi-armed bandits (specifically UCB) for adaptive task selection, which is well-justified for balancing exploration and exploitation. The methodology for task generation, difficulty parameterization (though requiring careful implementation), emergence point estimation, and evaluation is robust. The inclusion of a human-in-the-loop audit mechanism to validate automated scoring significantly enhances the rigor and addresses a known challenge with evaluating complex generative outputs. The experimental design includes necessary comparisons (different model types, static baseline) and appropriate statistical analysis. Technical formulations (UCB, emergence definition) are correct and clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and resources. The core components rely on existing LLMs, standard machine learning techniques (MABs), and procedural generation methods. The plan is realistic and outlines clear steps. However, challenges exist: 1) Designing diverse and reliably scorable tasks across different domains and calibrating the continuous difficulty parameter 'd' effectively requires significant engineering effort. 2) Automated scoring of planning, navigation, and ToM outputs can be complex and may require sophisticated parsers or reliance on LLMs themselves for evaluation, which the human audit partially mitigates but doesn't eliminate. 3) Running thousands of tasks per model implies substantial computational cost. These challenges seem manageable with adequate resources and careful implementation, making the proposal highly feasible but not trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the inadequacy of static benchmarks for evaluating the emergent cognitive capabilities of rapidly advancing LLMs. By providing a dynamic, adaptive benchmark, the research promises fine-grained cognitive profiles, enabling fairer comparisons and a deeper understanding of how abilities like planning and ToM emerge. This directly contributes to the goals outlined in the workshop task description. The expected outcomes—a public benchmark suite, insights into model limitations and emergence thresholds, and guidance for future model design—could substantially advance the field of AI evaluation and cognitive science-inspired AI."
