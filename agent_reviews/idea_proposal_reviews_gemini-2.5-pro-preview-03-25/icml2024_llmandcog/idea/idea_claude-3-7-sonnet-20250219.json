    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed for the 'Workshop on LLMs and Cognition', specifically: 1) Assessing LLM performance on a core cognitive task (Theory of Mind), 2) Investigating fundamental limits of current language models (text-only limitations for ToM), and 3) Exploring how multimodal approaches can address these limits. The focus on enhancing ToM through multimodal grounding fits perfectly within the workshop's scope of understanding LLM cognitive abilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (LLM ToM limitations) is well-explained, and the proposed three-stage approach (pre-training, novel attention, evaluation) provides a structured overview. The goal of grounding ToM in perception is clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the 'curated dataset' (creation, annotation details) and the precise workings of the 'novel attention mechanism that explicitly tracks perceptual access', but the overall concept and research direction are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While multimodal learning for LLMs is an active research area, the specific focus on using structured visual scenarios (false-belief tasks) combined with a proposed novel attention mechanism explicitly designed to track perceptual access for improving ToM presents a fresh perspective. It's not merely applying existing multimodal techniques but suggests a tailored approach for a specific, challenging cognitive capability. The synthesis of these elements for ToM grounding offers notable innovation beyond standard multimodal pre-training."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. The primary hurdle lies in creating the 'curated dataset of videos depicting false-belief scenarios with annotated mental states' and, crucially, annotated perceptual access ('who saw what and when'). This annotation process is complex, potentially subjective, and labor-intensive. Developing and training the proposed novel attention mechanism integrated with visual and language processing would also require substantial technical expertise and computational resources. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation, especially data acquisition, presents considerable difficulties."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Theory of Mind is a cornerstone of higher cognition and social intelligence, representing a major frontier and known weakness for current AI systems, including LLMs. Successfully enhancing LLM ToM through perceptual grounding would constitute a major advancement, potentially leading to more sophisticated, socially aware AI agents and improved human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, bridging the gap between linguistic competence and grounded understanding addresses a fundamental question in AI, and insights gained could potentially inform cognitive science theories about social cognition development."
