        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on 'How can we improve existing benchmarks and evaluation methods to rigorously assess cognitive abilities in LLMs?'. This idea directly proposes a novel benchmark framework focused on dynamic cognitive assessment inspired by human cognitive science, addressing core workshop themes like LLM performance on cognitive tasks (reasoning, planning, theory of mind) and the need for better evaluation methods. The proposed collaboration with cognitive scientists also aligns with the workshop's interdisciplinary nature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of current static benchmarks), the main proposal (dynamic benchmark inspired by human cognitive tests), key features (dynamic scenarios, process metrics, transfer learning), and expected outcomes (taxonomy of abilities, insights for model improvement). Examples like inferring goals and revising plans make the concept concrete. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While benchmarking LLMs and evaluating cognition are existing areas, the specific approach of creating *dynamic*, *open-ended* benchmarks modeled after *human neuropsychological tests* and emphasizing *process metrics* (like error recovery and reasoning coherence) over simple outcome accuracy is innovative in the context of LLM evaluation. It moves beyond static question-answering or task completion towards assessing adaptive cognitive processes, offering a fresh perspective compared to many current benchmarks."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Designing dynamic, open-ended tasks that are both meaningful and consistently evaluable is complex. Developing reliable and scalable metrics for cognitive *processes* (coherence, adaptation, error recovery) is significantly harder than measuring outcome accuracy and may require substantial human annotation or sophisticated automated methods. Collaboration with cognitive scientists is feasible but requires effort. Access to LLMs is generally possible. While ambitious, it is achievable with dedicated resources and careful design."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged limitation of current LLM evaluation methods â€“ their inability to capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of human-like cognition. Developing more sophisticated benchmarks aligned with cognitive science could lead to a much deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, potentially guiding the development of more robust and general AI. The focus on process could yield actionable insights for improving model architectures, making a substantial contribution to the field."
