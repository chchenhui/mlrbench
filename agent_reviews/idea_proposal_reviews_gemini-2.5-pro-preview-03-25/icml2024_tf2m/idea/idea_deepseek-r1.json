        "justification": "The research idea aligns perfectly with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the 'Efficiency' theme, specifically focusing on 'Data-efficient training and fine-tuning strategies' and 'Efficient training, finetuning, and inference algorithms'. Furthermore, it leverages 'information-theoretic principles', explicitly mentioned as a key theoretical tool in the workshop summary and listed under 'Statistical and information-theoretic perspectives on model capabilities'. The motivation regarding computational costs and resource consumption also matches the concerns highlighted in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (high cost of FM fine-tuning), the core proposal (information-theoretic data selection using joint mutual information), the two-stage approach (theoretical analysis and adaptive algorithm), and the expected outcomes (40-60% data reduction) are clearly articulated. Key technical considerations like gradient approximations and kernelized embeddings for scalability are mentioned, demonstrating a well-thought-out plan. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise formulation of the MI bounds or the exact mechanics of the adaptive algorithm, but the overall concept is exceptionally clear and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While data selection for efficient learning is an existing research area, the specific proposal to use *joint mutual information* between data points and *model parameters* as the core criterion for selecting batches during *FM fine-tuning* is innovative. It moves beyond common heuristics like uncertainty or diversity sampling by proposing a more theoretically grounded measure directly linking data informativeness to parameter updates. The combination of deriving theoretical bounds based on MI and developing a corresponding adaptive algorithm tailored for FMs represents a fresh approach in this domain."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core difficulty lies in the computation of joint mutual information, especially involving high-dimensional FM parameters and data representations, which is generally intractable. The proposal acknowledges this by suggesting 'gradient-based approximations' and 'kernelized embeddings'. The feasibility hinges on the effectiveness, accuracy, and computational overhead of these approximations. While techniques for estimating MI exist, ensuring they scale efficiently within a fine-tuning loop for large FMs requires careful implementation and potentially significant computational resources for development and validation. The theoretical analysis part is standard research practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance and impact potential. Reducing data requirements for FM fine-tuning by 40-60% without sacrificing performance would be a major advancement. It directly tackles the critical issues of high computational cost and resource consumption associated with large models. Success would lower the barrier for adopting and customizing FMs, particularly for researchers or organizations with limited resources, thereby democratizing access. Furthermore, providing a *principled*, information-theoretically grounded method for data selection adds significant value beyond ad-hoc heuristics and aligns with the workshop's goal of strengthening the theoretical foundations of FMs and promoting sustainable AI."
