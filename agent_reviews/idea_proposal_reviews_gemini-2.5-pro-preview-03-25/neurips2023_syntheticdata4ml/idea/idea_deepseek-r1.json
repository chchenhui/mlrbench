        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: synthetic data generation using Generative AI (specifically LLMs), focusing on tabular data, and tackling the critical issue of bias and fairness. It aims to generate high-quality data for trustworthy ML, explicitly addressing the gap identified in the task description where generative models often neglect fairness. The motivation and proposed solution perfectly match the workshop's goals of using synthetic data to empower trustworthy ML training, particularly in high-stakes domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is clearly articulated and well-defined. The motivation, main technical approach (LLMs, tabular-to-text conversion, conditional generation, RL for fairness), and evaluation strategy are explained concisely. The concept of using LLMs guided by fairness constraints via RL is understandable. While specific implementation details (e.g., exact RL formulation, prompt engineering specifics) could be further elaborated, the overall idea is presented with good clarity and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using LLMs for generation and addressing fairness in ML are known areas, the specific combination proposed is innovative. Applying LLMs to generate *fair* synthetic *tabular* data by converting records to text and using Reinforcement Learning with fairness-based rewards to guide the generation process is a fresh approach. It moves beyond standard generative models that primarily focus on fidelity and tackles the fairness challenge in the generative setting, as highlighted in the workshop description."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Leveraging large LLMs requires substantial computational resources. Converting tabular data to effective text prompts needs careful design. The core technical challenge lies in successfully implementing and tuning the Reinforcement Learning component to enforce fairness constraints without overly sacrificing data fidelity or introducing unintended biases. Balancing the reward function for fairness and utility is non-trivial. While the components (LLMs, RL, fairness metrics) exist, their integration for this specific task requires considerable expertise and experimentation, making it moderately difficult to implement successfully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized problem: algorithmic bias stemming from biased training data, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance and healthcare mentioned in the motivation. Providing a scalable method to generate fair synthetic tabular data could lead to major advancements in building equitable AI systems. This directly aligns with the workshop's goal of promoting trustworthy ML and addresses a key limitation of existing datasets and generative techniques."
