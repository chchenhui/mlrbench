    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the task (data scarcity, privacy, fairness in tabular data using generative AI/LLMs). The methodology aligns perfectly with the research idea (fine-tuning LLMs with DP-SGD and fairness constraints). It incorporates and builds upon recent works cited in the literature review (DP-LLMTGen, DP+Fairness concepts), positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape and addressing identified gaps like harmonizing multiple constraints within LLMs for tabular data."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology section provides specific details on datasets, model architecture choices (LLMs, DP-SGD with equations, fairness regularizer with equation), and a comprehensive evaluation plan with concrete metrics and baselines. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for 'fairness-aware masking' in decoding, but these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity required at the proposal stage."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using LLMs for DP synthetic data and combining DP with fairness are areas explored in the literature review, the specific proposed approach—integrating DP-SGD fine-tuning *and* a KL divergence-based fairness regularizer directly into an LLM framework for *tabular* data, potentially augmented by constrained decoding—represents a novel combination and refinement. It directly builds on very recent work (e.g., DP-LLMTGen exploring fairness) but proposes a more integrated solution. The novelty lies in the specific synergistic integration rather than a completely new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages well-established methods like DP-SGD (with correct formulation) and fairness regularization within a recognized LLM framework. The choice of evaluation metrics (FD, downstream ML, DP budget, MIA, DP diff, EOD diff) is appropriate and comprehensive. The plan includes ablation studies and comparison against relevant SOTA baselines, indicating methodological rigor. The theoretical basis is solid, although the practical interaction between DP noise and the specific fairness regularizer might present challenges, which the proposal acknowledges by planning to study trade-offs. The constrained decoding part lacks full technical detail but is conceptually sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing pre-trained LLMs, standard DP libraries (like Opacus), and publicly available benchmark datasets. The required computational resources are typical for LLM fine-tuning research. The main challenge lies in the complex hyperparameter tuning required to simultaneously satisfy potentially competing constraints (utility, privacy, fairness) and achieve the ambitious quantitative targets (\\epsilon \\le 2, significant fairness improvement, minimal utility loss). However, the proposed steps are logical and implementable with current technology and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in trustworthy AI: the lack of high-quality, private, and fair training data, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance targeted by the task description. Successfully developing such a framework using powerful LLMs would represent a major advancement in synthetic data generation, enabling safer data sharing, bias mitigation, and potentially accelerating ML adoption in high-stakes applications. The research directly tackles key challenges highlighted in the literature and workshop theme."
