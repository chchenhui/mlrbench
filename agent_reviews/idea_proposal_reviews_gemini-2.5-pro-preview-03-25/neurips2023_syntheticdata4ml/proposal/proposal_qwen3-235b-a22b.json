    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for synthetic data generation methods using generative AI (specifically LLMs) that tackle data scarcity, privacy, and fairness simultaneously. The proposal elaborates precisely on the research idea, detailing the use of LLMs, DP mechanisms (DP-SGD), and fairness constraints (loss term, constrained decoding). It effectively positions itself within the provided literature, citing relevant recent works (DP-TBART, DP-LLMTGen, TableDiffusion, DP-2Stage) as baselines and acknowledging the key challenges identified (utility-privacy-fairness trade-off). It explicitly aims to bridge the gap mentioned in the task description regarding the lack of methods combining DP and fairness, especially using LLMs for tabular data."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The methodology section provides specific details on datasets, preprocessing, the chosen LLM (Llama-3-8B), DP integration (DP-SGD with formula), fairness constraints (loss function, constrained decoding concept), baselines, and evaluation metrics. The structure is easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable. While minor details like the exact mechanism for 'fairness-aware masking' could be elaborated further, the overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While combining DP and fairness in synthetic data generation is not entirely new (as shown in the literature review, e.g., Refs 6-8, 10 using GANs/VAEs/Transformers), this proposal focuses specifically on integrating these constraints within a modern large language model (Llama-3) framework for tabular data. The novelty lies in the specific proposed integration strategy: combining DP-SGD fine-tuning with both a fairness-aware loss term *and* fairness-constrained decoding. This dual approach to enforcing fairness within an LLM generator, building upon recent DP-LLM works (like DP-LLMTGen which mentioned fairness exploration), offers a fresh perspective and distinguishes it from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (LLMs, DP-SGD, moments accountant, standard fairness metrics like Demographic Parity). The proposed methodology (DP-SGD fine-tuning, fairness loss term, constrained decoding) uses established techniques applied in a coherent manner. Technical formulations for DP-SGD and the fairness loss are correctly presented. The choice of baselines and evaluation metrics is appropriate and comprehensive. Minor uncertainties exist regarding the potential negative interactions between strong DP noise and fairness enforcement, and the empirical effectiveness of the proposed constrained decoding strategy, but the overall technical approach is well-justified and robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing pre-trained models (Llama-3), standard libraries (PyTorch, DeepSpeed, opacus), and publicly available datasets. The required computational resources (A100 GPUs) are significant but standard for LLM research. The research plan is well-defined with clear steps. Potential challenges include the computational cost of DP-SGD training, the complexity of hyperparameter tuning (balancing privacy budget, fairness weight, utility), and ensuring the constrained decoding mechanism works effectively without degrading output quality. However, these challenges seem manageable within a dedicated research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely challenge at the intersection of generative AI, privacy, and fairness, directly relevant to the workshop's theme of trustworthy ML. Generating high-utility synthetic tabular data with formal DP guarantees and demonstrable fairness properties would be a major advancement, particularly for sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Success would enable safer data sharing and fairer algorithm development, potentially influencing policy and practice. The research directly contributes to the scientific understanding of how to control LLM generation for complex constraints."
