        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of developing universal AI methods for scale transition in complex systems, referencing the Dirac quote and targeting relevant high-impact areas (fusion, materials/catalysis). The proposal meticulously expands on the NeuroScale research idea, detailing its components and motivation. Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, acknowledging recent advancements in neural operators, PINNs, multiscale modeling, and UQ, while clearly identifying the specific gaps (generalizability, cross-scale consistency, UQ for information loss, adaptivity) that NeuroScale aims to fill. The proposed work fits perfectly within the 'New scientific result' track."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, motivation, and research objectives are articulated precisely. The methodology section is detailed, outlining the architecture (including mathematical sketches of key components like the base operator, attention, and loss functions), data generation strategy, training procedure, and a comprehensive experimental plan with specific benchmarks, baselines, evaluation scenarios, and metrics. The structure is logical and easy to follow. While some fine-grained implementation details are naturally omitted at the proposal stage, the overall plan and concepts are presented with exceptional clarity and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing concepts like neural operators, physics-informed learning, attention, and UQ, the novelty lies in the specific *synthesis* and *application* tailored for multiscale modeling. Key novel aspects include: 1) The scale-adaptive attention mechanism designed to dynamically weight information across resolutions within the operator. 2) The explicit cross-scale physics regularization terms (\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{inter}, \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{cons}) aimed at enforcing physical laws *during* scale transitions, going beyond typical intra-scale PINN constraints. 3) The integration of UQ specifically focused on quantifying information loss associated with changes in scale. This combination represents a fresh perspective distinct from the cited works, which often focus on only one or two of these aspects or apply them differently."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in operator learning, physics-informed ML, attention mechanisms, and established UQ techniques (Bayesian inference, deep ensembles). The proposed methodology is robust and well-justified; the architectural components are plausible, the physics regularization terms are conceptually correct (though requiring careful implementation per problem), and the UQ approaches are standard. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate benchmarks, strong baselines, diverse evaluation scenarios (interpolation, extrapolation, zero-shot scaling), ablation studies, and relevant metrics covering accuracy, efficiency, physics consistency, and UQ quality. The technical formulations, while high-level in places, are correctly presented."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable challenges. The technical implementation of the combined architecture (adaptive attention, cross-scale physics, UQ) is complex and will require careful engineering and tuning. Defining and implementing accurate cross-scale physics constraints (\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{inter}, \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{cons}) demands domain expertise for each benchmark problem. Generating sufficient high-fidelity simulation data is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Training these models, especially Bayesian variants or ensembles, requires significant computational resources (acknowledged by the proposal, mentioning A100/H100 GPUs). While the plan is realistic, the ambition level implies substantial effort and potential hurdles in achieving stable and effective training. The risks associated with hyperparameter tuning and ensuring the components work synergistically are non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and long-standing challenge of scale transition in scientific computing, a bottleneck explicitly highlighted by the workshop. Success would represent a major advancement towards the workshop's goal of 'universal AI methods' for this problem. By aiming for enhanced generalizability, improved physical fidelity across scales, principled uncertainty management, and computational acceleration, NeuroScale has the potential to unlock new research possibilities in high-impact fields like materials science, fusion energy, climate/weather modeling, and potentially others mentioned in the workshop call. The work could lead to substantial methodological contributions to scientific ML and accelerate discovery in computationally limited domains."
