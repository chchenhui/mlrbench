    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core challenge of developing universal AI methods for scale transitions in complex systems, referencing Dirac's complexity problem and targeting high-impact applications mentioned (fusion, climate, materials). The methodology directly implements the research idea's three pillars (adaptive attention, physics regularization, UQ coarse-graining). It explicitly positions itself relative to the cited literature (EquiNO, PIPNO, PINNs, etc.), aiming to overcome their identified limitations and address key challenges like constraint enforcement, UQ, and generalizability highlighted in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated effectively. The methodology section breaks down the approach into logical components with corresponding mathematical formulations. The experimental design is well-structured. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise derivation of the entropy-based prior for UQ or the exact implementation details of the wavelet attention kernel, but these do not significantly hinder understanding the core concepts. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like neural operators, attention, physics-informed losses, wavelets, and Bayesian methods exist, the specific *synthesis* proposed appears novel. Key novel aspects include: (1) the hierarchical cross-scale attention mechanism using wavelets within a neural operator framework for adaptive scale interaction, (2) enforcing physics constraints explicitly across multiple scales identified by the decomposition, and (3) integrating Bayesian uncertainty quantification specifically into the coarse-graining step informed by physical principles. This combination distinguishes it clearly from the cited prior work (EquiNO, PIPNO, standard PINNs) by offering a more adaptive, physically consistent, and uncertainty-aware approach to multiscale operator learning."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (neural operators, PINNs, attention, wavelets, Bayesian inference). The proposed methodology is generally well-justified and logically connects the components. The mathematical formulations for attention and physics loss are presented, though some details (e.g., precise definition of u^(l) in the loss, derivation of the entropy prior p(z_c|phi)) could benefit from further elaboration for complete rigor. The overall approach is technically plausible and grounded in relevant literature, addressing known challenges in a principled way."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing ML frameworks and scientific computing expertise. Implementing the combined components (wavelets, attention, physics loss, Bayesian layers) is achievable but requires significant engineering effort. Access to high-fidelity simulation data (as listed in datasets) is crucial and might be a bottleneck depending on the specific problem domain. Training the complex model will demand substantial computational resources (GPU clusters). The experimental plan is realistic. Key risks involve potential optimization difficulties in balancing multiple complex loss terms and ensuring the novel attention mechanism performs effectively, but these are typical research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the fundamental challenge of scale transition, which is central to progress in numerous critical scientific domains (fusion, climate, materials science, biomedicine), as emphasized in the task description. A generalizable, physically consistent, and efficient framework like NeuroScale could lead to major advancements and potentially transformative changes in how complex systems are simulated. The expected outcomes (speedups, improved accuracy, better physical consistency, UQ) are substantial. The plan for open-sourcing enhances community impact."
