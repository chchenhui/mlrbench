        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on world models, causality, training, evaluation, and applications. The core idea of using counterfactual latent state prediction is consistently maintained throughout the proposal, from introduction to methodology and expected outcomes. It explicitly references and builds upon the concepts mentioned in the literature review, particularly the recent works (Refs 5-10) on causal and counterfactual world models, and addresses the key challenges identified. The objectives and methodology directly operationalize the research idea and align with the workshop themes like 'Understanding World Rules' and 'World model training and evaluation'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-defined, and logically structured. The research problem, proposed solution (CAWM), objectives, and methodology are articulated precisely with minimal ambiguity. The technical details, including the conceptual framework, potential architectures, loss function formulation, data generation strategy, and evaluation plan, are explained thoroughly and are easy to follow. The distinction between standard prediction and counterfactual prediction objectives is clearly delineated. The significance and expected outcomes are also clearly stated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the general idea of integrating causality and counterfactual reasoning into ML models, including world models, is an active research area (as evidenced by the literature review, especially Refs 5-10 from 2023 which seem to directly address similar concepts), this proposal offers a specific and well-defined approach: focusing on counterfactual *latent state* prediction as the primary mechanism. It proposes systematic investigation of different architectures (Transformers, SSMs) and intervention mechanisms within this framework (CAWM). The novelty lies in the specific formulation, the proposed systematic comparison, and the detailed evaluation plan focused on generalization to unseen interventions and latent space analysis, rather than just the high-level concept of causal world models."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in established world model principles (Dreamer, sequence models) and causal reasoning concepts. The proposed methodology is robust: using simulators for ground-truth counterfactuals is standard practice, the combined loss function is well-motivated, the architectural choices (Transformers, SSMs) are state-of-the-art, and the evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse metrics, generalization tests, downstream task evaluation, and ablation studies. The technical formulations (loss functions) are clearly presented and appear correct. The core hypothesis (counterfactual prediction leads to causal representation) is plausible and testable."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and standard ML research resources. The required components (deep learning frameworks, simulators like MuJoCo/Habitat) are available. The methodology, while computationally intensive (requiring extensive simulation for counterfactual data and training large models), follows established practices in world model research. Key challenges include careful implementation of the counterfactual data generation pipeline (requiring simulator state access), tuning the loss weight lambda, and potentially achieving strong generalization to truly novel interventions. However, these are considered manageable research risks rather than fundamental roadblocks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses a critical limitation of current world models â€“ their lack of causal understanding, which hinders robustness and generalization, especially for interventions. Improving this aspect has major implications for deploying AI safely and effectively in complex, dynamic environments like robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare, aligning perfectly with the workshop's scope. Success would represent a substantial advancement in world model capabilities, potentially leading to more reliable planning, decision-making, and even applications in scientific discovery through better simulation of interventions. The research directly contributes to the key themes of the workshop."
