        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea directly and explicitly addresses the 'AI4Mat Unique Challenges' theme mentioned in the task description, focusing on managing multimodal, incomplete materials data and incorporating domain knowledge (physics) where scientific understanding might be incomplete. It proposes a concrete ML approach (Physics-Constrained Multimodal Transformer) tailored to these specific challenges, making it perfectly aligned with the workshop's focus."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. It clearly states the motivation (sparse, multimodal data), the core components (Transformer, modality-specific handling, cross-attention, physics constraints), and expected outcomes. The methods for incorporating physics constraints (soft constraints in loss, physically-informed attention) are mentioned, providing a good conceptual understanding, although specific architectural details or constraint formulations would require further elaboration for implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While Transformers, multimodal learning, and physics-informed ML are existing concepts, the proposed combination tailored for sparse materials data is innovative. Specifically, designing cross-attention for missing modalities and integrating diverse physical constraints (phase diagrams, conservation laws, etc.) directly into a Transformer for this domain offers notable originality. It's a novel synthesis and application of existing techniques to address a specific, challenging problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The core components (Transformers, attention mechanisms, loss function modification) are based on established ML techniques. Implementing modality-specific tokenizers and cross-attention is feasible. Incorporating physics as soft constraints is standard. Designing physically-informed attention layers requires more research effort but is conceptually sound. The main challenge lies in curating suitable multimodal datasets and precisely formulating the physical constraints, but the ML methodology itself is largely feasible with current technology and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a critical bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery: effectively utilizing sparse, heterogeneous, and incomplete experimental data. Integrating physical laws promises more robust, generalizable, and interpretable models, which is crucial for scientific applications. Success could significantly accelerate the discovery process by enabling reliable predictions even with limited data, directly contributing to the goals of the AI4Mat field and potentially leading to major advancements."
