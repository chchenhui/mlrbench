    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes ('Why Isn't it Real Yet?' and 'AI4Mat Unique Challenges') by focusing on multimodal data, incompleteness, and physics integration â€“ key reasons cited for slower progress in materials AI. The methodology precisely elaborates on the research idea of a Physics-Constrained Multimodal Transformer (PCMT). It effectively uses the literature review to position itself, citing relevant works as baselines or context (MatAgent, Meta-Transformer, specific material discovery papers) and explicitly tackling the identified challenges (sparsity, multimodality, physics constraints, missing modalities)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology (including data sources, preprocessing, model architecture stages with equations, and experimental design), and expected outcomes are articulated clearly. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mathematical formulation or derivation of the symmetry compatibility matrix (M_sym) in the constraint-aware attention, but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed approach."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While multimodal transformers (like Meta-Transformer) and physics-informed machine learning exist, the core novelty lies in the specific integration of domain-specific physical constraints (crystallographic symmetry, thermodynamics) directly into both the attention mechanism and the loss function of a multimodal transformer tailored for diverse materials data (structural, spectral, synthesis). This approach differs significantly from using generic multimodal frameworks or relying solely on external physics simulators/knowledge bases (like MatAgent). The focus on handling missing modalities within this physics-constrained framework also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (Transformers, GNNs, ViTs, physics-informed learning) and established methods. The proposed methodology, including modality-specific encoding, cross-attention fusion, and physics-based regularization, is logical and well-justified. The technical formulations provided (GNN update, attention modification, loss function) are generally correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is robust, featuring relevant baselines, metrics, datasets, and ablation studies. Minor gaps exist, such as needing more detailed justification for the specific form of the constraint-aware attention mechanism (M_sym), but the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing, accessible datasets and builds upon well-established model architectures (Transformers, GNNs, ViTs) with available software libraries. The core technical challenges lie in implementing and tuning the novel physics-constrained components (attention mechanism, regularization term), which requires expertise but is achievable. The 12-month timeline is ambitious but structured logically. Access to significant computational resources (GPUs) will be necessary, which is standard for this type of research. The risks associated with implementing novel components are acknowledged but appear manageable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses critical bottlenecks hindering progress in AI-driven materials discovery: integrating heterogeneous, sparse data and incorporating physical laws for reliable predictions. By aiming to create more robust, interpretable, and physically plausible models, the research has the potential to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel materials in key areas like energy storage (solid-state electrolytes) and spintronics (altermagnets), as highlighted. Success would represent a substantial methodological advancement for AI in the physical sciences and directly contribute to answering the workshop's central question, 'Why Isn't it Real Yet?'."
