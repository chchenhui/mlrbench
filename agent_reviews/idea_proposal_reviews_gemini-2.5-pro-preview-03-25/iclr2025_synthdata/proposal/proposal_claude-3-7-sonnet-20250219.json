    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core question of the task regarding synthetic data's role in solving the data access problem by proposing a specific method ('Active Synthesis'). It incorporates key themes from the task description, such as algorithms for synthetic data generation, mixing synthetic and real data, evaluation, conditional generation, and addressing limitations (efficiency). The methodology closely follows the research idea, detailing the steps of uncertainty quantification, targeted generation, and retraining. It also acknowledges and positions itself relative to the concepts presented in the literature review (uncertainty-guided generation, active learning integration), even if the novelty aspect is debatable based on that review."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The introduction clearly states the problem, motivation, and objectives. The methodology section is meticulously structured, breaking down the 'Active Synthesis' framework into logical components (initial training, uncertainty quantification, generation, integration, evaluation). Each component is explained with sufficient technical detail, including specific methods, equations, and experimental parameters. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and unambiguous. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. The writing is concise and the structure facilitates easy understanding."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal's novelty is limited. While presented as a 'novel framework', the core idea of using model uncertainty to guide synthetic data generation, often in an active learning loop, is well-established in the very recent literature provided (e.g., papers #2, #5, #7, #8, #9, #10 from 2023). Crucially, paper #6 is even titled 'Active Synthesis: Bridging Active Learning and Data Augmentation', suggesting the name and core concept might not be original. The proposal's contribution appears to be more in the comprehensive integration, comparison of multiple techniques (uncertainty, generation, integration), and evaluation across diverse domains, rather than a fundamentally new concept. The proposal does not sufficiently differentiate its specific approach from these closely related works."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in active learning, uncertainty quantification (using standard and appropriate methods like ensembles, MC dropout, Bayesian NNs), and generative modeling (LLMs, Diffusion, GANs). The proposed methodology is logical, well-structured, and technically detailed. The experimental design is rigorous, including comparisons against multiple relevant baselines, ablation studies, systematic variation of conditions, and plans for statistical validation (repeated runs). The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and cover performance, efficiency, robustness, and data quality. The technical formulations presented are correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The required techniques (deep learning models, uncertainty methods, advanced generative models) are available. However, implementing and integrating the entire pipeline (uncertainty quantification -> conditioning information -> generative model -> data integration -> retraining loop) across three diverse domains (images, text, tabular) is complex and computationally intensive. Tuning the interaction between components (e.g., effectively translating uncertainty measures into conditions for generative models, optimizing data mixing strategies) will require substantial effort and expertise. While achievable for a well-equipped research team, it's a demanding project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: the data access bottleneck. Improving data efficiency and model robustness through targeted synthetic data generation has the potential for major impact. If successful, it could democratize ML, enhance privacy, improve safety in critical applications (as highlighted), and accelerate development cycles. The research directly tackles key challenges mentioned in the task description and aims to provide a more strategic approach to using synthetic data, potentially leading to substantial advancements in how models are trained in data-constrained environments."
