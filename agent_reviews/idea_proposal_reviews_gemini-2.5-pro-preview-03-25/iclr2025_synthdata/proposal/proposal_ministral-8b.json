    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core concept of using model uncertainty to guide synthetic data generation (the research idea). It fits squarely within the workshop's themes (task description) by proposing a new algorithm for synthetic data generation, focusing on model training, mixing synthetic/real data, and potentially addressing data concerns. The methodology and expected outcomes reflect the goals outlined in the idea, and the proposal acknowledges the context provided by the literature review, including relevant challenges."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, significance, and expected outcomes are stated plainly. The methodology section outlines a logical sequence of steps for the 'Active Synthesis' loop. The algorithmic steps and evaluation metrics are listed, providing a good overview. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise mathematical formulation and the exact mechanism for how uncertainty 'guides' generation, but the overall concept and plan are understandable without significant effort."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The proposal has minimal originality based on the provided literature review. The review itself lists numerous 2023 papers exploring the core concepts: active learning with synthetic data, uncertainty-guided data generation/augmentation, and combining generative models with active learning. One cited paper even uses the term 'Active Synthesis'. The proposal outlines a framework that appears very similar to these existing recent works and does not clearly articulate a unique contribution or significant departure from them. It seems more like an implementation or empirical study of recently proposed ideas rather than introducing a fundamentally new concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established principles in active learning, uncertainty quantification (mentioning ensemble variance, Bayesian methods), and generative modeling (mentioning LLMs, diffusion models). The proposed iterative methodology is logical and follows practices seen in related literature. The evaluation plan includes appropriate metrics. While the technical formulations are high-level and lack deep mathematical rigor, the underlying concepts and the overall approach are technically well-founded and consistent with current ML research practices."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Training models, estimating uncertainty (though potentially computationally intensive), using generative models, and retraining are all standard practices. The main challenge lies in the potential computational cost associated with iterative training, uncertainty estimation (especially Bayesian methods), and large generative models, as acknowledged implicitly by including 'Computational Complexity' as an evaluation metric and explicitly in the literature review challenges. However, assuming adequate computational resources, the plan is realistic and implementable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant and timely problem: the data access bottleneck in machine learning, which is central to the task description. Improving data efficiency, model robustness, and performance through targeted synthetic data generation could have a substantial impact. If successful, the work could contribute to democratizing ML, enhancing model reliability, and promoting more ethical data practices (by reducing reliance on sensitive real data). The potential contributions are meaningful and align well with important goals in the ML community."
