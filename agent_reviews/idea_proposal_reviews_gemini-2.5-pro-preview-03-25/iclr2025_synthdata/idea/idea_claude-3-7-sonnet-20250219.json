    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed for the workshop, including 'New algorithms for synthetic data generation', 'Synthetic data to address privacy... concerns', 'Evaluation of synthetic data quality' (via utility metrics), 'Fine-grained control of synthetic data generation' (via adaptive mechanisms and privacy budgeting), and 'Data access with... privacy-preserving methods'. The core theme of balancing utility and privacy in synthetic data aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of exploring the opportunities and limitations of synthetic data for solving the data access problem, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare mentioned in both the idea and the task's topics of interest."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated and well-defined. The motivation (privacy-utility trade-off) is explicitly stated. The proposed framework's main components (adaptive synthesis, differential privacy, risk assessment, multi-level generation, integrated verification/utility metrics, privacy budgeting) are outlined logically. The two-phase approach is understandable. While specific details of the generative models or risk assessment techniques are not provided, the overall concept and workflow are presented with good clarity and minimal ambiguity for a research proposal summary."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using differential privacy with generative models isn't entirely new, the proposed framework's emphasis on an *adaptive* mechanism that calibrates privacy based on domain-specific risk assessment and integrates utility/privacy verification directly into the generation loop offers a novel integration. The multi-level generative model applying varying privacy strengths adaptively, combined with explicit privacy budgeting tied to use cases, represents a potentially innovative approach to managing the privacy-utility trade-off more dynamically and granularly than standard methods. It builds upon existing work but proposes a distinct, integrated system."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core components (generative models, differential privacy mechanisms) are established technologies. However, integrating them into an adaptive framework that performs real-time risk assessment, dynamically adjusts privacy levels across data components, and optimizes based on complex utility/privacy metrics requires significant research and engineering effort. Defining robust domain-specific risk assessments and effective utility metrics will be crucial and potentially difficult. Calibration of the adaptive system and privacy budget will also require careful experimentation. The mention of preliminary experiments suggests initial feasibility, but scaling and refining the system will be demanding."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. It addresses the critical bottleneck of the privacy-utility trade-off, which currently limits the adoption of synthetic data in sensitive, high-impact domains like healthcare and finance. Successfully developing such a framework could unlock valuable data for machine learning applications while adhering to strict privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This directly contributes to potentially solving the data access problem discussed in the workshop task, offering a pathway to leverage sensitive datasets more safely and effectively. The potential impact on both research and industry practice is substantial."
