        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop CFP). It directly addresses multiple core topics of interest, including 'New algorithms for synthetic data generation', 'New applications of using synthetic data (healthcare, finance)', 'Synthetic data for model training', 'Synthetic data to address privacy... concerns', 'Evaluation of synthetic data quality', 'Data access with federated learning and privacy-preserving methods', and 'New paradigm of accessing data'. The proposal fits squarely within the workshop's theme of exploring synthetic data, privacy, and data access challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation outlines the problem effectively, and the main idea clearly describes the proposed framework (FL + DP Generative Models -> Aggregated Synthetic Data). Key innovations and evaluation plans are explicitly mentioned. While minor details about the specific aggregation mechanism for DP models could be further elaborated, the overall concept is immediately understandable and articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While FL, DP, and generative models are existing concepts, their specific combination within this framework – aggregating locally trained DP generative models (rather than just model parameters) in an FL setting to create a global synthetic dataset explicitly aiming to capture cross-client diversity – presents a novel approach. It differs from standard FL applied to discriminative models or centralized DP synthetic data generation, offering a fresh perspective on privacy-preserving collaborative data synthesis."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training DP generative models often involves a difficult trade-off between privacy and utility, requiring careful tuning. The core challenge lies in effectively aggregating multiple generative models (especially complex ones like GANs) trained under DP constraints in a federated manner. Ensuring the resulting synthetic data retains high fidelity and captures cross-client distributions while maintaining rigorous DP guarantees is non-trivial. Accessing suitable distributed datasets for evaluation also poses practical hurdles. Considerable research and engineering effort would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical and widespread problem of accessing sensitive data for collaborative machine learning in regulated domains like healthcare and finance. By proposing a method to generate privacy-preserving synthetic data that reflects distributed sources, it could unlock new possibilities for AI development while respecting privacy constraints. A successful implementation could represent a major advancement in secure data sharing and collaborative learning paradigms."
