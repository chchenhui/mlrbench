    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description (workshop call for papers). It directly addresses multiple topics of interest listed, including: 'New applications of using synthetic data (e.g. in healthcare)', 'Synthetic data for model training and evaluation', 'Synthetic data to address privacy... concerns', 'Conditional... synthetic data generation', and 'Mixing synthetic and natural data'. The focus on using conditional synthetic data to enhance model performance while preserving privacy in healthcare aligns perfectly with the workshop's theme of exploring the opportunities and limitations of synthetic data for solving data access problems."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (data scarcity/privacy in healthcare), the core proposal (hybrid real + conditional synthetic data), the method (generative models on anonymized data), and expected outcomes/impact are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the specific type of 'advanced generative models' to be used or the precise nature of the 'specific conditions' for generation, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While using synthetic data and generative models in healthcare is an active research area, the specific focus on *conditional* generation tailored to healthcare variables (demographics, clinical outcomes) combined with a hybrid real/synthetic training approach offers a degree of originality. However, it primarily combines and refines existing concepts rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking approach. The novelty lies more in the specific application and tailoring of conditional generation than in fundamentally new techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Training advanced generative models is computationally possible, and evaluating model performance is standard. The main challenges lie in obtaining suitable, high-quality anonymized healthcare data (which often requires institutional partnerships and careful anonymization) and rigorously validating both the fidelity and privacy-preserving properties of the conditionally generated synthetic data. These challenges are significant but not insurmountable with current methods and careful planning."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant with clear impact potential. Addressing data access limitations and privacy concerns in healthcare AI is a critical problem. Successfully demonstrating that conditional synthetic data can enhance model performance reliably and safely could lead to major improvements in diagnostic/prognostic tools, ultimately benefiting patient care. The research could also inform policy regarding synthetic data use in sensitive domains."
