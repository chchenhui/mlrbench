    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly consistent with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for bridging theory and practice in SSL, focusing on the theoretical foundations and theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks. The proposal elaborates precisely on the research idea of using information disentanglement via mutual information objectives. It acknowledges and aims to build upon concepts (disentanglement, MI in SSL) and challenges identified in the literature review, such as the heuristic nature of current tasks and the need for better theoretical understanding."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear and well-structured, with defined objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The core idea of maximizing MI between views while minimizing MI with nuisance variables is articulated. However, there is a lack of clarity regarding the precise definition and operationalization of 'view-specific nuisance variables' (z). The proposal does not specify how these variables will be identified, sampled, or represented, which is crucial for implementing the MI minimization term. Additionally, the method for estimating or optimizing the mutual information terms is not detailed."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal aims to provide a 'principled framework' for designing SSL tasks based on information disentanglement using MI objectives. While framing it as a general design principle is valuable, the core technical idea (maximizing MI between views, minimizing MI with nuisance/specific factors) appears in recent literature (Refs 3, 6, 8, 10 in the provided review). Ref 6, in particular, seems very close. The novelty likely lies in the specific instantiation of this principle, the potential derivation of *new* loss functions (both contrastive and non-contrastive) from this framework, and its systematic evaluation, rather than the high-level concept of using MI for disentanglement in SSL, which has existing precedent. The proposal could strengthen its claim to novelty by better differentiating its specific approach from these existing works."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is based on sound theoretical concepts from information theory (mutual information) applied to representation learning. The objective of separating invariant and variant information is well-motivated. However, the proposal lacks rigor in detailing the practical implementation of the core mathematical ideas. Specifically, it does not address how the mutual information terms (I(g(x); g(x')) and I(g(x); z)) will be estimated or optimized, which is a non-trivial problem, especially in high dimensions. Furthermore, the lack of definition for the 'nuisance variables' (z) makes the soundness of the MI minimization objective (â„’_{MI-min}) difficult to assess fully. Without addressing these practical estimation and definition challenges, the technical soundness remains partially unsubstantiated."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal leverages standard datasets and evaluation protocols common in SSL research, making the experimental setup feasible. However, significant technical challenges exist that are not fully addressed. The practical estimation or optimization of mutual information, especially high-dimensional MI, is notoriously difficult and computationally intensive. Existing methods often rely on bounds (like InfoNCE) or complex estimators. The proposal doesn't specify the chosen approach, raising feasibility concerns. Additionally, the ambiguity surrounding the definition and handling of 'nuisance variables' (z) presents a potential roadblock for implementing the MI minimization component. While conceptually feasible, the practical implementation faces hurdles requiring significant technical development or clarification."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in SSL: the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding, particularly regarding the design of auxiliary tasks. Developing a principled, theory-driven framework for task design could lead to more effective, robust, and interpretable representations. Success could provide valuable insights into *why* SSL works and enable the tailoring of tasks for specific downstream requirements (e.g., fairness, robustness), potentially advancing the field significantly. It directly aligns with the goals outlined in the task description for fostering dialogue between theory and practice."
