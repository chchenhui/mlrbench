    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for bridging theory and practice in SSL, focusing on theoretical foundations (information theory) and theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks. The methodology precisely implements the research idea of using information disentanglement (maximizing invariant MI, minimizing variant MI) as a principled framework. It effectively synthesizes concepts from the literature review (MI estimation, disentanglement, contrastive learning) and explicitly aims to tackle the identified challenges, such as the lack of theoretical understanding behind auxiliary tasks and the need for effective disentanglement."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The problem statement, motivation, and proposed approach (information disentanglement via MI) are articulated precisely. The methodology section clearly outlines the theoretical framework with mathematical formalizations, discusses practical implementation strategies using established techniques (InfoNCE, adversarial training, etc.), proposes specific novel tasks derived from the framework, and details a comprehensive experimental plan. The structure is logical, flowing smoothly from introduction to methodology and expected outcomes. The language is unambiguous and facilitates immediate understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the core components (mutual information, disentanglement, contrastive/non-contrastive SSL) are present in the literature review, the key novelty lies in synthesizing these into a unified, principled *framework* for *designing* auxiliary SSL tasks based on information disentanglement. It moves beyond proposing specific MI-based methods towards a more general theoretical grounding. The proposed tasks (DCL, IB-SSL, MVD, TSD) represent novel combinations or applications of existing ideas under this framework, particularly MVD and TSD. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as related MI/disentanglement work exists, but it offers a fresh, systematic perspective clearly distinct from purely heuristic approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in information theory and established representation learning principles (invariance, disentanglement). The proposed MI objectives are theoretically well-motivated for the stated goals. The plan to use standard estimators/bounds (InfoNCE, adversarial nets, variational methods) for implementation is appropriate. The derived auxiliary tasks follow logically from the framework. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive and rigorous, including multiple modalities, strong baselines, and diverse evaluation metrics. A minor potential weakness lies in the practical operationalization of 'nuisance variables' (n_i) and the potential complexity of optimizing the multi-term objectives, but the overall theoretical and methodological approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The core techniques (deep network training, InfoNCE, adversarial learning, variational methods) are standard, albeit computationally intensive. The proposed datasets are mostly standard benchmarks. The proposal acknowledges the need for significant computational resources (multi-GPU, mixed precision). The main challenges are the potential complexity in tuning the multi-objective losses (balancing \\\\lambda, \\\\beta) and the practical difficulty of defining and minimizing information related to unspecified 'nuisance variables'. The scope is ambitious, requiring substantial effort for the extensive experimental validation across multiple tasks and modalities, but it remains within the realm of achievable research projects given adequate resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged gap in SSL: the lack of theoretical grounding for auxiliary task design. Providing a principled framework based on information disentanglement could fundamentally advance the understanding and development of SSL. Success would likely lead to more effective, robust, and potentially fairer representations, impacting numerous downstream applications in CV, NLP, healthcare, etc. The research directly aligns with the workshop's goals and has the potential to make substantial contributions to both the theory and practice of representation learning."
