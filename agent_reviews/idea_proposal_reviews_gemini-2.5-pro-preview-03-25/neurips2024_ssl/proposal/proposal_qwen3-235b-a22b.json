    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for bridging theory and practice in SSL, focusing on theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks using information theory, which is a key topic mentioned. It faithfully translates the research idea of using information disentanglement (via MI objectives) into a concrete plan. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, citing relevant recent papers (e.g., DisentangledSSL, MI-based losses) and explicitly aiming to address key challenges identified in the review, such as the theoretical understanding of tasks and effective disentanglement."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives (Theoretical, Algorithmic, Empirical) are explicitly stated. The methodology section clearly outlines the theoretical framework using MI objectives, proposes specific model architectures and loss functions (DCL, NC-Disentangled), and details the experimental design (datasets, baselines, metrics). The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for projecting out variant features (v_1 = z_1 - \\\\text{Proj}(z_1 | s_1)), which could benefit from slightly more detail, but overall the proposal is well-articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the use of mutual information and disentanglement concepts in SSL is not entirely new (as evidenced by the literature review, particularly papers from 2023/2024 focusing on MI and disentanglement), the proposal's specific contribution lies in framing information disentanglement as a *unified principle* to derive *both* novel contrastive (DCL) and non-contrastive (NC-Disentangled) losses via a *dual objective* (explicitly maximizing shared MI while minimizing/penalizing variant MI/correlation). The claim of a modality-agnostic formulation also adds to the novelty. It represents a thoughtful synthesis and extension of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, grounded in information theory principles. The core idea of separating invariant and variant information via MI is theoretically appealing. The methodology translates this idea into concrete loss functions based on established SSL paradigms (InfoNCE, Barlow Twins). However, the specific terms used to minimize variant information (cosine similarity penalty in DCL, cross-correlation norm in NC-Disentangled) are heuristic proxies for minimizing mutual information, rather than direct estimators or tight bounds. This introduces a slight gap between the high-level MI theory and the practical implementation. Additionally, the precise definition and implementation of the variant component projection (v = z - \\\\text{Proj}(z|s)) lack full technical detail, slightly impacting the overall rigor. Despite these points, the approach is well-motivated and builds on solid foundations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The proposed methods (DCL, NC-Disentangled) are extensions of existing, widely implemented SSL techniques. The required resources (standard datasets like ImageNet, compute for training ViTs/BERT, standard evaluation protocols) are typical for ML research. The experimental plan is comprehensive and uses standard benchmarks and metrics. Potential challenges include hyperparameter tuning (e.g., \\\\lambda in DCL) and ensuring the practical effectiveness of the disentanglement mechanism (shared/variant heads), but these appear to be manageable research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and acknowledged gap in SSL: the lack of theoretical grounding for auxiliary task design. By proposing a principled framework based on information disentanglement, it has the potential to significantly advance the understanding of *why* SSL works. Success could lead to more effective, robust, and potentially fairer SSL methods, with actionable guidelines for practitioners. The explicit goal of improving robustness and the potential application across multiple modalities (vision, language, multimodal) enhance its impact. Bridging the theory-practice gap in such a rapidly evolving field carries substantial weight."
