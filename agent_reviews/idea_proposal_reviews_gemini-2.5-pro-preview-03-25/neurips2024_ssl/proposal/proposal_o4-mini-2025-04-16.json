    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for bridging theory (information theory) and practice (SSL task design), tackling key questions about why SSL works. It perfectly elaborates on the research idea of using information disentanglement for principled task design. Furthermore, it effectively synthesizes concepts from the literature review (MI estimation, disentanglement, SSL) and aims to address the identified key challenges, such as the lack of theoretical understanding and effective disentanglement in heuristic SSL task design."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and specific. The methodology section is detailed, providing a clear problem formulation, the core information-theoretic objective, specific variational approximations (InfoNCE, MINE), loss derivations, an algorithmic framework, and a comprehensive experimental plan. Mathematical notation is used effectively. The rationale and significance are well-articulated. While the practical sampling/definition of nuisance variables could be slightly more detailed, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity and a logical structure."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by proposing a unified information-theoretic framework (-I(Z1;Z2) + beta*Sum[I(Zi;Ni)]) as a *general principle* for designing *both* contrastive and non-contrastive SSL tasks. While components like MI estimation (MINE, InfoNCE) and disentanglement goals exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the specific formulation aimed at explicitly balancing invariance and nuisance disentanglement across different SSL paradigms (contrastive/non-contrastive) appears novel. Combining standard SSL losses with an adversarially estimated nuisance MI term presents a fresh approach compared to existing heuristic methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on solid theoretical foundations in information theory and established SSL principles. The methodology is rigorous, employing well-known and appropriate techniques for intractable MI estimation (InfoNCE, MINE). The proposed loss functions are theoretically motivated by the disentanglement objective. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes strong baselines, diverse metrics (accuracy, robustness, fairness), ablation studies, and statistical validation. Technical formulations are clearly presented and appear correct. Potential challenges exist in the practical stability of MINE and the precise definition of nuisances, but the overall approach is technically sound."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using standard ML resources and techniques (deep learning frameworks, standard datasets, GPU compute). However, implementing and effectively training the MINE component for nuisance MI estimation introduces additional complexity, hyperparameters, and potential instability compared to standard SSL methods. Defining and sampling the nuisance variables (N_i) practically requires careful consideration and might vary across domains. Tuning the trade-off parameter \\beta will also require significant experimentation. While ambitious, the plan is realistic for a well-resourced research effort, placing it in the 'Good' feasibility range due to these added complexities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in SSL: the heuristic nature of auxiliary task design. Developing a principled, theory-driven approach has the potential for major impact. Success could lead to a deeper understanding of SSL, the systematic design of more effective, robust, and fair representations, reduced reliance on empirical trial-and-error, and accelerated adoption of SSL in critical domains. The expected contributions—theoretical framework, novel objectives, empirical gains, and improvements in robustness/fairness—are substantial and clearly articulated, promising significant advancements in the field."
