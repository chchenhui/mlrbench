        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions on the theoretical foundations of SSL, theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks, sample complexity, comparative analysis of tasks, and the role of information theory in SSL. The proposed idea directly addresses these points by suggesting an information-theoretic framework (mutual information) to analyze and quantify the utility of auxiliary tasks, link this utility to sample complexity, and provide a basis for comparing tasks and potentially guiding architecture design. It aims to bridge the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding, which is the core theme of the workshop described in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation outlines the problem (heuristic task selection in SSL), the main idea proposes a specific solution (MI-based task utility measure linked to sample complexity), and the expected outcomes are concrete (ranking metric, theoretical guarantees, guidelines). The use of mutual information as the core theoretical tool is explicitly stated. The concept of measuring utility via MI between representations and 'downstream task's latent variables' is understandable, although the precise operationalization of 'latent variables' might require further specification in a full proposal, this level of detail is excellent for a research idea."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While information theory has been used in representation learning (e.g., Information Bottleneck), applying it specifically to quantify the 'utility' of diverse SSL *auxiliary tasks* and formally linking this measure to *sample complexity bounds* for SSL represents a novel direction. It moves beyond simply using MI principles *within* an SSL objective (like contrastive learning) to using MI as an *analytical tool* to evaluate and compare different SSL pre-training strategies. Proposing a framework to theoretically ground task selection and efficiency is innovative compared to prevalent empirical approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the reliable estimation of mutual information, especially between high-dimensional representations and potentially complex latent variables of downstream tasks. This often requires sophisticated estimators or tractable bounds (like InfoNCE, MINE), which might introduce approximation errors affecting the framework's accuracy. Defining and accessing/estimating the 'downstream task's latent variables' without labels also needs careful consideration. Deriving tight theoretical bounds connecting MI to sample complexity can be mathematically demanding. While experimental validation across modalities is standard, it requires substantial computational resources. The core concepts are theoretically sound, but practical implementation and validation face hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding *why* certain SSL tasks are effective and quantifying their efficiency is a fundamental open problem in the field. A successful execution of this research could provide a principled framework for designing and selecting auxiliary tasks, potentially replacing current heuristic and computationally expensive trial-and-error methods. Establishing theoretical links between task properties (utility) and sample efficiency would be a major contribution to SSL theory. The potential impact includes accelerating SSL research, reducing the computational burden of developing new SSL methods, and enabling more systematic progress in representation learning across various domains."
