        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions on the theoretical foundations of SSL, theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks, sample complexity, information theory in SSL, and understanding why certain tasks perform better. The proposed idea directly addresses these points by offering a counterfactual information-theoretic framework to analyze SSL, linking task performance to causal feature learning, deriving sample complexity bounds for robustness, and providing principles for designing auxiliary tasks. It perfectly fits the workshop's goal of bridging theory and practice in SSL."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (lack of theoretical grounding for SSL robustness) and the core proposal (counterfactual information-theoretic framework linking MI maximization over counterfactual views to causal features and robustness) are well-explained. The plan to formalize this, derive bounds, and validate experimentally is logical. Minor ambiguities exist around the precise definition and generation of 'counterfactual views' in practice, which would need further elaboration in a full proposal, but the overall concept is understandable and coherent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While information theory, invariance, and even causality have been explored in representation learning, the specific proposal to use a *counterfactual* information-theoretic framework as the basis for analyzing and designing SSL tasks appears novel. Explicitly linking the maximization of mutual information between counterfactual views to learning causal mechanisms for robust representation learning offers a fresh perspective compared to standard invariance-based SSL analyses. Deriving sample complexity bounds specifically for robustness within this framework adds to the novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The theoretical development (formalizing the framework, deriving bounds) requires significant expertise but is achievable within theoretical ML research. The main challenge lies in translating the theoretical principles into concrete, practical auxiliary tasks, particularly defining and implementing 'counterfactual views' across different data modalities. Experimental validation is standard but depends on the successful implementation of these new tasks. Overall, it's feasible with the right expertise, though the practical implementation requires careful design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses fundamental and critical questions in SSL: the theoretical basis for the effectiveness of different tasks and how to achieve robust representations that generalize under distribution shifts with better sample efficiency. Developing a principled framework for designing robust SSL tasks could lead to major advancements, impacting various application domains where robustness and data efficiency are crucial. Success would provide both deep theoretical insights and practical benefits."
