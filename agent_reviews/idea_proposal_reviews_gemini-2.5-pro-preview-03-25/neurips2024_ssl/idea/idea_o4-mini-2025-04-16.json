    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), focusing on the design of auxiliary tasks, which is a key topic mentioned ('Theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks in SSL', 'Comparative analysis of different auxiliary tasks'). It explicitly aims to bridge theory (sample complexity analysis) and practice (empirical performance across domains), aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of fostering dialogue between these aspects. It also touches upon sample complexity and explores SSL across multiple domains (vision, text, time-series), all listed as relevant topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main concept (bilevel meta-learning framework with inner/outer loops), components (controller network, base encoder), and intended contributions (theoretical bounds, empirical results) are well-explained. The overall mechanism of automated task discovery is understandable. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific parameterization of the auxiliary task family by the controller network (φ) and the precise optimization technique for the outer loop, but these are details expected in a full paper rather than a summary. The core idea is presented clearly."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While meta-learning for automating ML components (like architecture search or data augmentation) exists, applying a bilevel meta-learning framework specifically to *discover* the structure and parameters of SSL auxiliary tasks themselves is innovative. It moves beyond optimizing hyperparameters of fixed tasks or finding augmentation policies, aiming to learn the task objective itself. Combining this automated discovery with theoretical sample complexity analysis further enhances its novelty within the SSL field."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Bilevel optimization is notoriously computationally expensive, requiring repeated training in the inner loop for each outer loop update. Defining a sufficiently expressive yet tractable search space for auxiliary tasks via the controller network (φ) is non-trivial. Optimizing φ using gradient-based methods or policy gradients can be complex and potentially unstable. While conceptually sound and related methods exist, the practical implementation requires substantial computational resources and careful engineering, making it moderately challenging but not impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Automating the design of auxiliary tasks addresses a major bottleneck in SSL research, potentially leading to more effective, data-specific pretext tasks discovered with less human effort. If successful, it could improve representation quality and sample efficiency, as suggested by the proposed theoretical analysis. Providing insights into *why* certain tasks are effective (by analyzing the learned controller/tasks) addresses a fundamental question in the field. Achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple domains, as claimed, would constitute a major advancement."
