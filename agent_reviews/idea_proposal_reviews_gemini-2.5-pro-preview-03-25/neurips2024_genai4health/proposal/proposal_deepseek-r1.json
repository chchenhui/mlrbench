        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of GenAI potential, trustworthiness (Topic 2), and policy compliance (Topic 3) in healthcare. The proposed dynamic benchmarking framework specifically targets the need for novel benchmarks and evaluation of safety, reliability, and ethical disparities mentioned in Topic 2, and incorporates policy compliance evaluation (Topic 3). It builds logically on the provided research idea, elaborating on each component (synthetic data, multi-modal testing, clinician feedback, explainability). Furthermore, it explicitly references and integrates techniques from the cited literature (Bt-GAN, discGAN, HiSGT) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified (bias, compliance, fidelity, multi-modal integration, feedback)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The background establishes the problem context effectively, leading to specific, measurable research objectives. The methodology is broken down into logical modules with clear descriptions of the techniques to be used (including specific model names like Bt-GAN, HiSGT, discGAN, and metrics like SHAP). Key concepts like policy-aware simulation, bias mitigation, multi-modal consistency, and clinician feedback loops are explained well, often accompanied by relevant formulas. The experimental design is concrete, specifying datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the project's goals and approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality and innovation. While it leverages existing techniques (GANs, Transformers, SHAP, contrastive learning), its core novelty lies in the concept of a *dynamic* and *integrated* benchmarking framework specifically for trustworthy GenAI in healthcare. This contrasts with existing static benchmarks. The integration of adaptive synthetic data generation (including policy constraints and edge cases), multi-modal consistency checks, real-time clinician feedback, and automated compliance/explainability analysis into a single evaluation system is a novel contribution. It directly addresses limitations highlighted in the background and literature review regarding the adaptability and comprehensiveness of current evaluation methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and methodologically rigorous. It grounds its approach in established machine learning techniques and relevant, recent literature (Bt-GAN, discGAN, HiSGT). The proposed methods for synthetic data generation, multi-modal testing, feedback integration, and compliance/explainability analysis are appropriate for the stated objectives. The inclusion of specific formulas for metrics like fairness weighting, alignment loss, trust score, and SHAP demonstrates technical depth. The experimental design is well-thought-out, including both synthetic and real-world data, relevant baselines, and a comprehensive set of metrics covering fairness, compliance, fidelity, and explainability. The approach appears robust and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core technologies (GANs, Transformers, SHAP) are available, and access to datasets like MIMIC/TCGA/BRATS is possible through standard procedures. However, integrating the four distinct modules (synthetic data, multi-modal testing, clinician feedback, analysis) into a seamless framework requires significant engineering effort. Generating high-fidelity, policy-compliant synthetic data, especially for rare cases and multi-modal scenarios, is technically demanding. Establishing and maintaining a reliable real-time clinician feedback loop requires careful design, recruitment, and management. The project likely requires substantial computational resources and diverse expertise (ML, healthcare informatics, potentially web development)."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the responsible adoption of GenAI in healthcare. Evaluating trustworthiness, safety, compliance, and clinical fidelity dynamically is critical for building confidence and ensuring patient safety. Current static benchmarks are insufficient, as highlighted in the proposal. By providing an adaptive, policy-aware, and clinically validated framework, this research has the potential to establish a new standard for evaluating healthcare GenAI models. The expected outcomes (open-source framework, novel metrics, synthetic datasets, guidelines) could have a substantial impact on developers, clinicians, regulators, and ultimately patient care, accelerating the ethical integration of GenAI into this high-stakes domain."
