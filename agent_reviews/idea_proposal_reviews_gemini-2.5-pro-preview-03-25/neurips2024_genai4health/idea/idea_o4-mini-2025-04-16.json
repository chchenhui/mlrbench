        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of GenAI potential in health, trustworthiness risks, mitigation strategies, and policy compliance. Specifically, it proposes a novel benchmark for trustworthiness and risks (Topic 2) and incorporates policy compliance evaluation and mitigation (Topic 3). The multi-modal aspect aligns with the call's mention of LLMs and multi-modality models. It fits perfectly within the 'Research papers for the policy-compliant GenAI trustworthiness in health' track."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, main components (Benchmark Design, Risk Taxonomy, Mitigation Pipeline, Evaluation), and intended impact are clearly stated. Specific examples like RAG and MC dropout are provided. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact scope of 'policy schemas' or the specific metrics, but the overall concept and approach are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While benchmarking AI and using techniques like RAG or uncertainty quantification exist, the proposed combination is innovative. Specifically, creating a *multi-modal* benchmark tailored to *clinical scenarios* and *policy compliance* in healthcare, coupled directly with an integrated *mitigation framework* (RAG + Uncertainty + Rule-based verification), offers a fresh perspective compared to general AI safety benchmarks or isolated mitigation techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Curating a diverse, realistic, multi-modal benchmark suite (EHR, radiology, Q&A) requires substantial domain expertise, effort, and potentially difficult data access/privacy considerations. Defining robust policy compliance metrics and implementing effective rule-based verification across modalities is complex. While the individual technical components (RAG, MC dropout) are feasible, their integration and the data curation aspect require considerable resources and careful execution."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Establishing trust and ensuring safety/compliance are critical barriers to GenAI adoption in healthcare. A standardized, domain-specific, multi-modal benchmark and mitigation framework like MedGuardBench would be extremely valuable for developers, regulators, and clinicians. It directly addresses major risks (hallucinations, policy violations) and could substantially accelerate the safe and effective deployment of GenAI in clinical settings, potentially leading to major advancements."
