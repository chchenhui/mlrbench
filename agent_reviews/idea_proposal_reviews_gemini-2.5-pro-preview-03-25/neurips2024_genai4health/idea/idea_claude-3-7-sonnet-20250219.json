        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The TrustMed idea aligns excellently with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on GenAI trustworthiness, policy compliance, and pipelines coordinating stakeholders in healthcare (Topic 3). TrustMed directly addresses these points by proposing a framework to integrate policy compliance throughout the GenAI lifecycle, aiming to build trust and ensure safe deployment, which are central themes of the workshop."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented clearly. The motivation (trust deficit due to compliance uncertainty) is well-stated. The main idea is broken down into three distinct, understandable components (policy translator, continuous verification, report generator). The overall goal and validation approach are also mentioned. While the specific technical details of each component (especially the translator) would need further elaboration in a full paper, the core concept and structure are well-articulated and mostly unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers good novelty. While research exists on AI compliance and trustworthy AI, TrustMed proposes a novel *integrated framework* specifically for healthcare GenAI that embeds policy compliance *throughout the development lifecycle*. The combination of automated policy-to-technical requirement translation, continuous verification during development and deployment, and transparent reporting within a single, cohesive system represents an innovative approach compared to post-hoc audits or focusing on isolated aspects of compliance."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant challenges. The continuous verification and reporting components build on existing techniques in runtime monitoring and XAI. However, the 'policy-to-technical requirements translator' is ambitious. Accurately and comprehensively converting complex, nuanced legal and regulatory text (like HIPAA) into verifiable technical specifications automatically is a major hurdle requiring significant advances in NLP, knowledge representation, and legal informatics. This component significantly impacts the overall feasibility score, as its success is crucial for the framework. Implementation would require substantial interdisciplinary effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Lack of trust and demonstrable policy compliance are major barriers to adopting powerful GenAI tools in the high-stakes healthcare domain. Successfully developing a framework like TrustMed could substantially increase stakeholder confidence (patients, clinicians, regulators), facilitate responsible innovation, accelerate the adoption of beneficial GenAI applications, and potentially set standards for AI governance in healthcare. Addressing this trust gap is critical for realizing GenAI's potential in medicine."
