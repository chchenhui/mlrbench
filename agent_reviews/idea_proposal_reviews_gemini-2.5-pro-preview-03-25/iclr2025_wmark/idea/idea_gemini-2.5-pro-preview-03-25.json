        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop on GenAI watermarking). It directly addresses two key topics listed: 'Algorithmic advances and new applications of watermarking' (proposing a novel adversarial training framework) and 'Adversarial robustness and security-related topics' (the core focus is enhancing robustness against attacks). The motivation also touches upon practical deployment, relevant to 'Industry requirements'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation outlines the problem effectively. The main idea clearly explains the proposed adversarial training framework, the roles of the different components (embedder, detector, adversary), and the joint optimization process. The objective of achieving robustness against attacks is explicitly stated and easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial training is a well-established technique for improving robustness in other ML domains (e.g., against adversarial examples), its specific application as an end-to-end framework for jointly training watermark embedders, detectors, and a dedicated removal adversary within the context of GenAI watermarking offers a fresh perspective. It combines existing concepts in a novel way to address the specific challenge of watermark brittleness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Adversarial training frameworks are common in deep learning. However, implementing and successfully training a three-component system (embedder, detector, adversary) can be computationally expensive and may face challenges related to training stability and convergence. Defining and optimizing the adversary to effectively simulate diverse real-world attacks while minimizing perceptual distortion requires careful design and experimentation. It's feasible but requires significant engineering effort and computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Watermark robustness is a critical bottleneck for the reliable deployment of GenAI watermarking for content provenance, copyright protection, and mitigating misuse. Current watermarks are often vulnerable. Developing methods like the one proposed, which promise significantly enhanced resilience against removal attacks, addresses a crucial problem and could lead to major advancements in trustworthy AI and AI governance."
