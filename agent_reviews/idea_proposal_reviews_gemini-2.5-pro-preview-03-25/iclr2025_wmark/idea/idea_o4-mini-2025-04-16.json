    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses 'Algorithmic advances' (dual-layer approach, dynamic keys, adversarial training), 'Adversarial robustness and security' (core focus on resisting attacks and transformations), and 'Evaluation and benchmarks' (explicit plan to evaluate and publish a benchmark). It also touches upon 'Industry requirements' by aiming for an extensible protocol. It perfectly fits the technical focus of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, the two main components (token-level, latent-space), the dynamic keys, and the adversarial training concept are explained. The goals and evaluation metrics are specified. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of the latent-space perturbations and the adversarial attacker network, but the overall research direction is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While token-level and latent-space watermarking exist independently, combining them into a dual-layer system is less common. The integration of dynamic key rotation during training and, particularly, the proposed adversarial 'removal game' to explicitly train for robustness against watermark stripping attacks represent significant innovative elements beyond standard watermarking techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current ML techniques. Token-level modifications and latent space manipulations are achievable, although the latter requires deeper model access. Implementing dynamic keys is straightforward. The adversarial training component is conceptually sound (akin to GANs or adversarial robustness training) but likely requires significant computational resources and careful tuning to balance watermark robustness, generation quality, and training stability. Creating the benchmark is also feasible but requires dedicated effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Robust watermarking is a critical challenge for the responsible deployment of generative AI, essential for traceability, content provenance, and mitigating misuse. Current methods often fail against simple transformations or attacks. Developing a demonstrably more robust, adaptive watermarking scheme like the one proposed could have a major impact on the field and industry practices, directly addressing a key safety and security concern."
