        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description (Workshop on GenAI Watermarking). It directly addresses several key workshop topics, including 'Algorithmic advances' (proposing a hierarchical embedding strategy, adaptive strength, federated verification), 'new applications' (focusing on multimodal generative AI), 'Adversarial robustness and security-related topics' (aiming for resistance to manipulations, using cryptographic signatures, federated verification), and 'Industry requirements' (mentioning standardized APIs). It implicitly touches upon 'Evaluation and benchmarks' (as any proposed framework would need evaluation) and 'Policy, regulations and ethics' (by mentioning tiered verification for different requirements)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the overall goal of a unified multimodal watermarking framework is understandable. The hierarchical structure (base, bridge, verification) provides a good conceptual outline. However, some components, particularly the 'cross-modal bridge layer' and 'federated verification mechanisms', lack specific detail on *how* they would function technically. While the high-level concept is clear, the specifics of implementation remain somewhat ambiguous, requiring further elaboration for complete understanding."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While watermarking for individual modalities and GenAI exists, the concept of a *unified* framework specifically designed for *multimodal* coherence (preserving watermarks across transformations like text-to-image) is innovative. The combination of hierarchical embedding, adaptive strength based on content sensitivity, cryptographic security, and particularly the proposed 'cross-modal bridge' and 'federated verification' represents a fresh and ambitious approach that goes beyond standard single-modality or simple concatenation methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Developing robust watermarks for even a single modality against advanced attacks is difficult. Creating a system that works seamlessly across multiple modalities (text, image, audio, video), maintains coherence during cross-modal generation (a major technical hurdle), ensures cryptographic security, allows federated verification without key exposure, and remains imperceptible is extremely ambitious. Each component requires substantial research and development, and integrating them into a unified, robust framework presents considerable technical and practical difficulties. Success would likely require breakthroughs in several areas."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the challenge of reliable content provenance and attribution for multimodal generative AI is critical for combating misinformation, protecting intellectual property, ensuring accountability, and fostering trust in AI systems. A successful framework as described could provide a foundational technology for responsible AI deployment and potentially influence industry standards and regulations. The problem it tackles is timely and of major importance."
