    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on GenAI watermarking, particularly algorithmic advances, adversarial robustness, and evaluation/benchmarks. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core research idea of dynamic adversarial training. Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the robustness-imperceptibility trade-off and generalization against unseen attacks, citing relevant recent papers like InvisMark, REMARK-LLM, and Certifiably Robust Watermark."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly written. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated logically. The core concept of dynamic adversarial training using a minimax framework is explained well. The mathematical formulation provides necessary detail, and the experimental plan is outlined clearly. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architectures or hyperparameter tuning strategies for the adversarial game, but this level of detail is often omitted in initial proposals. Overall, the proposal is mostly clear and readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by applying dynamic adversarial training specifically to the co-evolution of a watermark embedder and a suite of adaptive attackers for generative content. While adversarial training and watermarking exist independently, their integration in this dynamic, game-theoretic framework to explicitly train for robustness against evolving threats in generative models (both text and image) appears novel compared to the cited literature, which often focuses on static robustness, specific attack types, or certified guarantees. The emphasis on generalization to *unseen* attacks through this dynamic process is a key innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound theoretical foundations, primarily minimax optimization common in adversarial ML (like GANs). The methodology is rigorous, employing standard loss components (fidelity, detection, adversarial) and evaluation metrics (SSIM, BLEURT, bit accuracy). The approach of training against a diverse suite of attackers is logically sound for improving robustness. The mathematical formulation is appropriate for the described framework. While adversarial training can face practical stability issues, the proposed approach itself is technically well-founded and grounded in established principles."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current deep learning frameworks, datasets (LAION, C4), and generative models. The outlined steps are logical. However, implementing and stabilizing the dynamic adversarial training loop, especially with multiple complex attackers and large models/datasets, presents significant computational challenges and requires careful tuning. Access to substantial compute resources and expertise in both generative modeling and adversarial training is crucial. While achievable, the practical implementation involves moderate risks and resource intensity."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research addresses a highly significant and timely problem: ensuring the trustworthiness and provenance of AI-generated content through robust watermarking. Improving resilience against adversarial attacks is a critical bottleneck for current methods. Success would have substantial impact on industries relying on content authentication (media, publishing), potentially inform policy (like the EU AI Act mentioned), and advance the field of AI safety and adversarial ML. The development of open benchmarks would also be a valuable contribution to the research community."
