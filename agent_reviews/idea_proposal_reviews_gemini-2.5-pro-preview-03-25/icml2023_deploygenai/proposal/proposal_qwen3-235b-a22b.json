    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the task description, particularly the need for safety, interpretability, and human-facing evaluation in deploying generative AI in high-stakes domains like healthcare. The research objectives and methodology are a direct translation of the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal effectively situates itself within the provided literature, referencing key papers (DIA, PHANES, THOR, medXGAN, MONAI) and explicitly stating how SAFEGEN aims to fill a gap (spatial interpretability for synthetic image safety) identified implicitly or explicitly in the review. The focus on interpretable safety checks for generative models perfectly matches the workshop themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to detailed methodology, expected outcomes, and impact. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section clearly outlines data handling, the two-stage model architecture (anomaly detection and interpretability), and the experimental design, including datasets, baselines, metrics, and implementation details. The use of specific algorithm names (DIA, Grad-CAM, SHAP) and formulas enhances clarity. While minor details like the exact adaptation of DIA for synthetic images or the specific classification task for Grad-CAM could be slightly more explicit, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the core components (diffusion models for anomaly detection, Grad-CAM/SHAP for interpretability) are based on existing techniques cited in the literature review (e.g., DIA, medXGAN), the novelty lies in their specific synthesis and application. SAFEGEN uniquely focuses on post-hoc, interpretable safety checks specifically for *synthetic* medical images, providing spatial feedback on potential artifacts. This differs from cited works focusing on detecting *real* anomalies in patient scans (DIA, PHANES, THOR) or interpreting classifiers/latent spaces (medXGAN). The proposal clearly articulates this gap and its contribution towards filling it, offering a fresh perspective on generative model validation in healthcare."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques like diffusion models (proven for distribution modeling and anomaly detection - DIA, THOR) and established interpretability methods (Grad-CAM, SHAP). The proposed two-stage methodology (anomaly detection followed by interpretability) is logical. The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines (PHANES, MITS-GAN), appropriate quantitative metrics (AUROC, Dice), crucial human evaluation involving radiologists, and statistical validation methods. Technical formulations like the Grad-CAM equation are correctly presented. The acknowledgment of limitations (3D generalization, ground truth definition) further strengthens its soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing technologies and libraries (MONAI, PyTorch, diffusion models, interpretability tools). The plan is detailed with a realistic 12-month timeline and clear milestones. The required compute resources (8x high-end GPUs) are significant but available in well-equipped research labs. Key risks are identified: securing diverse data (especially proprietary) and obtaining sufficient radiologist time for evaluation. The initial focus on 2D slices makes the initial phase more manageable, although extending to 3D is necessary for full impact. Overall, the plan is generally realistic with manageable risks, making the project highly likely to be implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of generative models before deployment in the high-stakes medical domain. This directly aligns with major concerns in the field and the workshop's focus. By providing interpretable safety checks, SAFEGEN has the potential to increase clinical trust, enable better auditing and improvement of generative models, and potentially contribute to meeting regulatory requirements for AI transparency. Successful execution would represent a substantial contribution to safe AI deployment in healthcare, with clear benefits for researchers, developers, clinicians, and potentially patients."
