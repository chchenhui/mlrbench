    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on deployment challenges of generative AI in high-stakes domains (healthcare), emphasizing safety and interpretability. It faithfully translates the research idea into a structured proposal. Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the need for interpretable anomaly detection in medical imaging."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, with defined objectives, methodology sections, and expected outcomes. The core idea of combining anomaly detection and interpretability for generated image safety is understandable. However, the specific mechanism of the anomaly detection module (using a U-Net with MSE loss for *detection* rather than just reconstruction) lacks precise explanation and introduces some ambiguity. How anomalies are specifically flagged based on the reconstruction needs clarification. The 'Feedback Mechanism' section is also somewhat brief."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by applying existing techniques (anomaly detection, interpretability methods like Grad-CAM/SHAP) to a specific, pressing problem: ensuring the safety and realism of *generated* medical images. While the individual components are not new, their integration and application as an interpretable safety check framework (SAFEGEN) for synthetic medical data represents a fresh perspective distinct from merely detecting anomalies in real images or interpreting classifiers. The literature review confirms the relevance but doesn't show an identical approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is conceptually sound in its motivation and overall goal. Using anomaly detection trained on real data to evaluate synthetic data, coupled with interpretability, is a reasonable approach. However, the technical soundness of the proposed anomaly detection methodology is questionable. The use of a U-Net with a simple MSE loss (L_anomaly) is presented without sufficient justification for how it functions as an *anomaly detector* rather than just a reconstructor. Standard anomaly detection often involves training only on normal data and using reconstruction error, or employing more specialized techniques. This lack of rigor or clarity in the core technical method significantly weakens the proposal's soundness. The experimental design is generally sound, though."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using existing technologies (CNNs like U-Net, interpretability libraries for Grad-CAM/SHAP). Training these models is standard practice. However, key feasibility challenges include: 1) Acquiring a suitable dataset of real medical images, potentially requiring careful curation and labeling of 'normal' images and potentially images with 'known artifacts'. 2) Accessing or developing a generative model to produce the synthetic images for evaluation. 3) Securing time from clinical experts (radiologists) for validating the interpretations. These factors introduce moderate implementation risks/challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the safe deployment of generative models in medical imaging. Ensuring the quality, realism, and safety of generated medical data is critical for clinical trust and downstream applications (e.g., training diagnostic AI). An interpretable framework like SAFEGEN could have a major impact by providing necessary quality control, enhancing trustworthiness, and facilitating the responsible adoption of generative AI in healthcare, aligning perfectly with the task description's emphasis on deployment-critical features."
