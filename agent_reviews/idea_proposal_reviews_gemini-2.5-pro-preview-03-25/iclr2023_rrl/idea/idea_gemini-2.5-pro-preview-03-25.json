    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Reincarnating RL' by proposing a method to reuse prior computation, specifically 'learned policies'. It explicitly tackles one of the key challenges highlighted in the task description: dealing with the 'suboptimality of prior computational work'. The goal of accelerating training and improving performance by leveraging multiple, potentially conflicting, prior policies fits perfectly within the workshop's scope of interest."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (handling multiple suboptimal teachers), the core mechanism (Adaptive Policy Distillation with competence estimation and dynamic weighting), and the expected outcome (faster learning, better performance) are clearly stated. Minor ambiguity exists in the precise method for competence estimation ('possibly using offline evaluation metrics or limited online interaction'), which would require further specification for implementation, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While policy distillation and using multiple teachers are known concepts, the specific approach of dynamically weighting distillation loss based on *state-dependent competence estimation* for multiple *suboptimal* RL teachers appears novel. Standard approaches often involve simpler averaging or selecting the single best teacher. This adaptive, state-aware mechanism for combining potentially conflicting suboptimal policies offers a fresh perspective within the context of reincarnating RL."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Policy distillation is a standard technique. The core components, such as training a student policy and applying weighted losses, are implementable. The main challenge lies in the effective and efficient estimation of teacher competence in different state regions. Both suggested approaches (offline metrics, limited online interaction) are plausible but require careful design and validation. Depending on the complexity of the state space and the chosen estimation method, implementation could range from straightforward to moderately challenging, but it doesn't seem inherently impractical with current methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential within the Reincarnating RL field. It addresses the important and practical problem of how to effectively reuse multiple existing, imperfect policies, which is common in iterative development or when combining results from various sources. If successful, APD could lead to more robust and efficient methods for leveraging prior computation, potentially accelerating research and application development, and contributing to the democratization of RL by making better use of available resources (suboptimal policies)."
