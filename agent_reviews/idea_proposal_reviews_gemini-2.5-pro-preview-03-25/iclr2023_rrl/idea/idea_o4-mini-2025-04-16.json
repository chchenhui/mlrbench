    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for 'Evaluation protocols, frameworks and standardized benchmarks for leveraging prior computation in RL research' and highlights the 'Challenges for dealing with suboptimality of prior computational work'. The RL-PoS proposal directly addresses these points by creating a standardized benchmark focused on evaluating RL methods that reuse priors, specifically including priors of varying quality ('prior-optimality spectrum'). It aims to provide evaluation protocols and metrics, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals of formalizing the reincarnating RL setting and understanding the impact of prior suboptimality."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (lack of standardized evaluation for prior reuse) is clearly stated. The main components of the proposed benchmark (RL-PoS) are well-defined: (1) systematic generation of graded priors, (2) definition of tasks and environments, and (3) provision of an API and metrics. The types of priors, environments, and evaluation metrics are specified, making the proposal concrete and easily understandable. The overall goal and intended contribution are unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While RL benchmarks and studies on transfer learning/fine-tuning exist, the specific focus on creating a standardized benchmark for 'reincarnating RL' that systematically varies both the *type* and *quality* (optimality spectrum) of priors is innovative. Existing evaluations are often ad-hoc or assume near-optimal priors. The explicit goal of enabling the study of robustness to prior misalignment and providing a unified framework for comparing diverse reincarnation strategies (policy fine-tuning, model-based warm-start, offline RL from datasets) across a controlled spectrum of prior quality represents a novel contribution to evaluation methodology in this emerging area."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Generating priors with controlled budgets (e.g., varying training time/data) is a standard technique. Using established environments like MuJoCo and MiniGrid is practical. Developing a Python API and implementing baseline algorithms are standard software engineering tasks within ML research. Defining metrics like sample efficiency and regret is common practice. The main challenge lies in the engineering effort required to generate, store, and maintain a potentially large suite of priors and tasks, but it does not pose fundamental technical barriers. It's implementable with current resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and potential impact. The task description emphasizes that reincarnating RL is crucial for democratizing RL and for real-world applications, but lacks standardized evaluation. RL-PoS directly addresses this critical gap. By providing a standardized way to compare methods and study the crucial aspect of prior suboptimality, it can significantly accelerate progress, foster reproducible research, and guide the development of more robust and practical reincarnation algorithms. If adopted, it could become a standard resource, fulfilling a key need identified by the workshop organizers and the broader community."
