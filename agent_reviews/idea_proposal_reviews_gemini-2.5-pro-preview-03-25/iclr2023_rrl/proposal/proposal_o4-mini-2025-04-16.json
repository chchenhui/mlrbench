    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Reincarnating RL' by focusing on reusing prior computation (datasets, policies). It explicitly tackles the key challenge of suboptimal prior work, a central point in the task description and literature review. The objectives, methodology (using prior data, handling suboptimality), and expected significance (democratization, efficiency, robustness) directly map onto the goals outlined in the task description for the ICLR workshop. The proposal builds upon and cites relevant work mentioned in the literature review (Agarwal et al., Laskin et al., Silver et al.) while aiming to address the identified gap regarding principled handling of suboptimal priors."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, research gap, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely in the introduction. The methodology section provides a detailed step-by-step description of the proposed RPC algorithm, including data handling, uncertainty estimation via Q-ensembles, and the distilled offline policy learning objective with clear mathematical formulations. The algorithmic steps are explicitly listed. The experimental design is thoroughly specified, covering benchmarks, baselines, suboptimality conditions, metrics, and compute resources. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly stated. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it utilizes existing components like Q-ensembles for uncertainty (common in offline RL) and policy distillation, the core novelty lies in their specific integration and application for *retroactively correcting* suboptimal prior computation in the reincarnating RL setting. The proposed mechanism of using ensemble variance to explicitly compute reliability weights (w_\\\\beta) and modulate a distillation loss within an offline RL objective appears to be a novel approach specifically designed to mitigate error propagation from flawed priors. It distinguishes itself from simple fine-tuning, standard offline RL conservatism, or residual policy learning by actively filtering the prior information based on estimated reliability."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations in RL, including Q-learning, ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation, policy distillation, and offline RL principles. The proposed methodology (RPC algorithm) is technically plausible, and the mathematical formulations for the losses and uncertainty measures are correctly presented. The plan to provide theoretical insight by extending existing results from pessimistic offline RL (Kumar et al., 2020) demonstrates a commitment to rigor. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate benchmarks, strong baselines, controlled conditions, and relevant metrics, suggesting a rigorous empirical evaluation plan."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. The methodology relies on standard deep RL techniques (Q-ensembles, policy networks, offline training loops) that are well-understood and have existing implementations. The data requirements involve standard benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo) and simulated suboptimal datasets, which are readily achievable. The proposal explicitly mentions standard hardware (GPUs) and provides a reasonable compute budget estimate (5k GPU hours). The plan includes releasing code and data, further supporting feasibility and reproducibility. There are no obvious technical barriers suggesting the project is impractical with current technology and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in RL: how to effectively and robustly reuse prior computational artifacts, especially when they are suboptimal. This is central to the 'Reincarnating RL' paradigm described in the task description. Success would lead to more robust iterative RL development, significant computational savings (reducing the need for tabula-rasa training), and potentially lower the barrier to entry for complex RL problems (democratization). The focus on handling imperfect priors makes it highly relevant for real-world applications where legacy systems or datasets are common. The potential development of standardized protocols for evaluating reincarnating RL methods also adds to its significance."
