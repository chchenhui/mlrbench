        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea aligns perfectly with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed for the AI4NA workshop, including 'Foundation and Generative Models for Nucleic Acids' (specifically mentioning multimodal foundation models and generative models), 'Nucleic Acid Structure and Function' (focusing on tertiary structure and interactions), and 'Nucleic Acids in Therapeutics' (aiming for NA drug design and discovery). The goal of designing bespoke therapeutic NAs using AI is central to the workshop's theme of spotlighting NAs as the next frontier for AI research."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of sequence-only models), the main technical approach (multimodal foundation model using transformers and diffusion models), the data types involved (sequence-structure pairs, interaction data), the conditioning factors (functional constraints), and the validation strategy (simulations, in vitro tests). The expected outcomes and potential impact are also articulated concisely. There are no significant ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While generative models for sequences exist, the proposed approach of a *multimodal foundation model* that *co-generates* sequence, tertiary structure, and interaction profiles, conditioned on functional constraints, is innovative. Integrating diffusion models for structural refinement within this framework adds another layer of novelty. It moves beyond sequence generation to tackle the more complex challenge of structure-function relationships directly within the generative process for therapeutic design, representing a fresh perspective in the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Acquiring large-scale, high-quality paired sequence-structure-interaction datasets is difficult. Training large multimodal foundation models (transformers + diffusion) is computationally very expensive. Effectively conditioning generation on complex functional constraints like binding affinity requires robust predictive models or oracles, which are themselves challenging to develop. The proposed validation pipeline (MD simulations, in vitro testing) is also resource-intensive. While the components exist, their successful integration into a working system requires considerable effort, resources, and potentially methodological breakthroughs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Designing therapeutic nucleic acids with specific structures and functions is a critical challenge in drug discovery and biotechnology. Successfully developing such a generative model could dramatically accelerate the creation of RNA vaccines, gene therapies, aptamers, and other NA-based therapeutics. By integrating structural and functional considerations upfront, it could significantly reduce the failure rate and cost associated with traditional trial-and-error approaches, potentially leading to major advancements in precision medicine."
