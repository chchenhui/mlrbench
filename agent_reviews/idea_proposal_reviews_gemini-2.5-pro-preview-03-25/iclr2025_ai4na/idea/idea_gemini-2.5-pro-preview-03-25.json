        "justification": "The idea directly addresses multiple key topics listed in the workshop task description, including 'Generative models for NAs', 'Nucleic Acid Structure and Function' (specifically RNA tertiary structure), and has clear relevance to 'Nucleic Acids in Therapeutics' through the goal of designing functional RNAs. It perfectly aligns with the workshop's aim to explore AI for nucleic acid challenges."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented very clearly. The motivation (gap in 3D control), the proposed method (geometric deep learning, equivariant GNNs, conditional generation), the data sources (PDB), and the expected outcome (tool for de novo RNA design) are all well-defined and easy to understand with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While generative models for RNA and geometric deep learning for molecules exist separately, the proposed combination for *conditional generation* of RNA sequences based on *3D structural constraints* using equivariant GNNs is highly novel. It moves beyond sequence/secondary structure generation towards direct 3D conformational control, offering a fresh approach in RNA design."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible as the core technologies (GNNs, transformers, geometric DL libraries) and data (PDB) exist. However, significant challenges remain: learning the complex sequence-structure relationship for RNA, potential data sparsity for diverse RNA structures compared to proteins, high computational cost, and the inherent difficulty of validating *in silico* designs experimentally. Implementation requires significant expertise and effort but is achievable in a research setting."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a critical challenge in synthetic biology and therapeutics: designing RNA molecules with specific functions dictated by their 3D structures. Success would provide a powerful tool for creating novel aptamers, ribozymes, and other functional RNAs, potentially leading to major advancements in drug discovery, diagnostics, and bioengineering. The potential impact is very high."
