    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (AI for Nucleic Acids, generative models, therapeutic design), the research idea (DiffuNA concept, diffusion model, RL optimization), and the literature review (builds upon RiboDiffusion, DiffSBDD, uses tools like UFold, addresses cited challenges). It directly targets the workshop's themes and elaborates coherently on the initial idea while being well-grounded in recent relevant work."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (data, model architecture, RL loop, experimental design), and significance are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. Technical details like the diffusion process and loss function are included. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details of the GNN/Transformer modules and feature representations, but these do not significantly hinder overall comprehension."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal shows notable originality. While diffusion models and SE(3)-equivariant GNNs exist (e.g., RiboDiffusion for inverse folding, DiffSBDD for ligands), the core idea of using a 3D graph diffusion model for *joint generation* of RNA sequence and 3D structure, potentially conditioned on binding sites, is innovative. Combining this with RL fine-tuning for stability and affinity further enhances the novelty in the context of RNA therapeutic design."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established techniques (DDPMs, SE(3)-GNNs, Transformers, RL/PPO) on solid theoretical foundations. The methodology, including data sources (PDB, RMDB, synthetic data), 3D graph representation, SE(3)-equivariance consideration, diffusion formulation, and RL optimization strategy (using surrogate models like UFold/AutoDock), is well-reasoned. The evaluation plan is appropriate. Potential weaknesses lie in the reliance on synthetic data quality and the accuracy of surrogate models for the RL reward, but the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While data sources and prerequisite tools are available, training large-scale SE(3)-equivariant diffusion models on 3D graphs is computationally very expensive, requiring substantial GPU resources and expertise. Integrating the RL component adds further complexity. The validation relies on in silico methods, which is feasible, but the computational demands for training the core model pose a considerable risk to practical implementation within typical resource constraints."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical bottleneck of slow and expensive RNA therapeutic design. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially accelerating drug discovery, enabling personalized RNA therapies, and establishing AI as a key tool in nucleic acid research. The problem is important, timely, and aligns perfectly with the goal of advancing AI applications in nucleic acids for therapeutic benefit."
