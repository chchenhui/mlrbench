        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (AI for Nucleic Acids, generative models, therapeutic design), the research idea (DiffuNA concept, diffusion model, joint generation, RL refinement), and the literature review (building on RiboDiffusion, diffusion models in drug design, RNA structure tools, addressing cited challenges). It directly targets the workshop's themes, thoroughly elaborates the core idea, and positions itself effectively within the context of recent work and known challenges in the field. All components are well-integrated."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. It follows a logical structure, clearly outlining the background, objectives, significance, methodology, and expected outcomes. The methodology section provides substantial detail on data processing, model architecture (including equations for key components like diffusion, EGNNs, losses), training procedures, the RL loop, and the validation plan. The objectives are specific and measurable. While highly technical, the concepts are explained effectively, making the proposal readily understandable to experts in the field."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. While leveraging existing concepts like diffusion models (seen in protein/small molecule design and RNA inverse folding like RiboDiffusion) and EGNNs, the core idea of a *joint* sequence-structure diffusion model specifically for *de novo RNA therapeutic design* is novel. Furthermore, integrating conditional generation based on target pockets and an RL loop for optimizing functional properties (stability, affinity) represents a significant advancement over existing RNA generation methods, which often focus solely on inverse folding or structure prediction. The combination of these elements tailored for RNA is groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (diffusion models, equivariant GNNs, RL) and cites relevant state-of-the-art methods. The methodology is well-detailed, including data sources, preprocessing, model components, loss functions, and a comprehensive validation strategy with appropriate baselines and metrics. The technical formulations appear correct. Minor weaknesses include the inherent challenge of modeling the complex joint distribution of discrete sequences and continuous 3D coordinates, the reliance on potentially imperfect surrogate models (folding predictors, docking) for the RL reward, and the persistent issue of limited high-quality RNA 3D data, although the plan addresses data collection thoroughly."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Data sources are available, but training complex 3D equivariant diffusion models requires substantial computational resources (GPU clusters) and specialized expertise in ML, GNNs, RL, and RNA bioinformatics. Implementing the joint discrete-continuous diffusion process and integrating the RL loop effectively will require considerable development effort and careful tuning. While the plan is well-defined, the complexity introduces moderate risks regarding successful implementation within a typical project timeframe. The computational validation is feasible; experimental validation is appropriately deferred."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant bottleneck in modern medicine: the slow and expensive process of designing RNA therapeutics. Success would have a major impact by accelerating discovery, reducing costs, potentially enabling the design of therapies for new targets, and expanding the repertoire of RNA-based drugs. Beyond therapeutics, it could advance fundamental understanding of RNA biology and provide tools for synthetic biology. The potential contributions to both applied biotechnology and fundamental science are substantial and clearly articulated."
