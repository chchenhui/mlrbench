    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (AI4NA workshop focus on generative models for nucleic acid therapeutics), the research idea (elaborating on the DiffuNA concept), and the literature review (situating the work relative to RiboDiffusion, DiffSBDD, structure predictors, and addressing identified challenges). It comprehensively integrates all provided context, showing a deep understanding of the workshop's goals and the state-of-the-art."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, problem statement, proposed solution (DiffuNA), objectives, methodology, and expected impact are articulated concisely and logically. The technical details, while complex, are explained effectively for a proposal, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the core concepts and plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While leveraging existing concepts like diffusion models (RiboDiffusion) and SE(3)-equivariant GNNs (DiffSBDD for small molecules), its application to the *joint de novo generation* of RNA sequence, secondary, and tertiary structure, conditioned on structural targets (like pockets) and refined via RL for functional properties (stability, affinity), represents a significant and novel contribution to RNA design. It clearly distinguishes itself from inverse folding methods and adapts protein/molecule design techniques to the unique challenges of RNA."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (diffusion models, geometric deep learning, RL) and proposes a well-justified methodology using state-of-the-art techniques (SE(3)-equivariant GNNs). The data processing, model architecture, conditioning mechanisms, RL formulation, and validation plan are detailed and technically coherent. The technical formulations presented are appropriate and clearly explained at a conceptual level."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing and training a complex SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model for joint RNA generation, integrating conditioning, and implementing a functional RL loop requires substantial expertise, significant computational resources (GPU time), and high-quality training data (which might be limited). The reliance on external predictors for the RL reward also introduces dependencies and potential bottlenecks based on their accuracy. The overall scope is ambitious."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in RNA therapeutic discovery â€“ the rational design of functional molecules. If successful, DiffuNA could dramatically accelerate drug development, enable the design of novel RNA modalities, and provide a powerful tool for the research community. It tackles key challenges in the field and represents a substantial advancement in applying AI to nucleic acid science."
