    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (AI for Nucleic Acids workshop focusing on generative models and therapeutics), the research idea (DiffuNA concept), and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes by proposing a novel generative AI method for RNA therapeutic design. It builds upon and distinguishes itself from the cited literature (RiboDiffusion, DiffSBDD, structure predictors) and acknowledges the key challenges identified (data scarcity, folding complexity). All components are well-integrated and consistent."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides a good level of detail on data, preprocessing, model architecture (diffusion, GNN, sequence module), RL integration, and experimental design. The rationale is well-explained. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact GNN architecture choice beyond mentioning SE(3)-Transformer as an example, but the overall proposal is easily understandable and logically structured."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models and RL are established techniques, their specific combination within a 3D graph framework for *jointly* generating RNA sequences and structures optimized for therapeutic properties (stability and binding affinity) is innovative. It goes beyond existing RNA inverse folding (RiboDiffusion) or structure prediction tools by incorporating functional optimization directly into the generative process. The distinction from prior work is clearly articulated."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established and appropriate techniques like diffusion models, equivariant GNNs (crucial for 3D structures), Transformers, and PPO for RL. The graph representation, diffusion process formulation, and experimental design appear technically sound. The reliance on surrogate models (folding predictors, docking) for the RL reward is a practical necessity but introduces a potential source of error, slightly reducing the score from excellent. However, the overall approach is well-founded in current ML and bioinformatics practices."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Accessing the required datasets (PDB, RMDB, Rfam) is possible, but the availability of sufficient high-quality 3D RNA structural data for training a complex diffusion model might be a bottleneck, as acknowledged in the literature review. Training the proposed joint model (diffusion + GNN + Transformer + RL) will be computationally intensive, requiring substantial GPU resources. The success also depends on the accuracy of the surrogate models used for RL optimization. While conceptually feasible, practical execution involves considerable technical hurdles and resource requirements."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Designing functional RNA therapeutics is a major challenge in drug discovery. DiffuNA addresses this critical gap by proposing an AI-driven approach to accelerate lead generation, potentially discover novel RNA motifs, and target difficult proteins. Success would represent a substantial advancement in computational drug design for nucleic acids and could have a tangible impact on developing new therapies. The plan to release open-source tools further enhances its potential impact."
