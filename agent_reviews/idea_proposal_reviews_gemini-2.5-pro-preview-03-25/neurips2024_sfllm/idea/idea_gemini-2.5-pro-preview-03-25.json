        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for statistical tools for black-box models, listing 'Conformal prediction and other black-box uncertainty quantification techniques' and 'Auditing, safety, and risk analysis' as key topics. The idea directly proposes an Adaptive Conformal Prediction method for black-box LLMs to improve uncertainty quantification, which aligns perfectly with the specified topics and the overall goal of developing statistical foundations for LLMs to mitigate risks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-defined. The motivation (need for reliable LLM uncertainty, limitations of standard CP under distribution shift) is clearly stated. The core proposal (Adaptive CP for black-box LLMs, dynamic calibration, text-specific non-conformity scores, online updates) is well-articulated. The objective (maintaining coverage under distribution shift) is specific. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact design of the non-conformity scores (e.g., specifics of the auxiliary model) and the precise online update algorithms, but these are details expected to be fleshed out during research. Overall, the concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While Conformal Prediction is an established field and its application to NNs/LLMs is emerging, the focus on *adaptive* CP specifically for *black-box* LLMs under *distribution shift* is innovative. Standard CP often assumes stationarity or requires white-box access/retraining for adaptation. Developing text-specific non-conformity scores and online adaptation mechanisms based on recent performance or domain indicators without model retraining presents a fresh approach to a known challenge in LLM deployment."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate research and implementation challenges. Designing effective and computationally efficient non-conformity scores for complex, high-dimensional text outputs (e.g., using semantic similarity) is non-trivial. Developing robust online adaptation algorithms that react appropriately to shifts without being overly sensitive is challenging. Evaluating the method rigorously requires careful construction of benchmarks simulating domain shifts. Accessing black-box LLMs via APIs might introduce latency, cost, or rate-limiting constraints. However, the core concepts build on existing work in CP and online learning, making it achievable with dedicated effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Providing reliable, calibrated uncertainty estimates for LLMs, especially under the common scenario of distribution shift, is a critical unmet need. This directly addresses major concerns regarding the safety, trustworthiness, and risk management of deploying LLMs in real-world applications (e.g., healthcare, finance). Success in this area would represent a major advancement in making LLMs more dependable and could significantly facilitate their responsible adoption."
