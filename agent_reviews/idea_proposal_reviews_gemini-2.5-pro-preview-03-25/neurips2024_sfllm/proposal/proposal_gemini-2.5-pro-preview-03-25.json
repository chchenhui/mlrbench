        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for statistical tools for black-box LLMs, focusing on conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification, safety, and risk analysis as requested. It fully elaborates on the core research idea of semantic conformal prediction using embeddings. Furthermore, it effectively integrates the provided literature, citing relevant papers (e.g., ConU [1], semantic embeddings [7], semantic CP [10]) and positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape, explicitly tackling the identified key challenges (overconfidence, black-box UQ, calibration, generalization)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to detailed methodology and expected impact. Objectives are specific and measurable. The core idea, algorithmic steps (calibration and prediction), mathematical notations (nonconformity score, proxy score), and experimental design (models, datasets, metrics, baselines, ablations) are articulated with high precision and minimal ambiguity. The heuristic nature of the proxy score is clearly stated, adding to the transparency rather than detracting from clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the use of conformal prediction for LLMs ([1], [2], [3], [4]), semantic embeddings ([7]), and self-consistency ([1]) are concepts explored in recent literature (much of it very recent, 2024), the specific combination proposed here is innovative. It focuses on constructing *sets* of semantically plausible candidates for open-ended generation in a *black-box* setting, using reference-based semantic distance for calibration and a self-consistency-based semantic proxy score for prediction. This specific formulation, particularly the bridge between calibration (using true references) and prediction (using proxy scores based on candidate consistency) to form semantic sets, offers a fresh perspective distinct from prior work, even though it builds directly upon it ([1], [7], [10])."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the established theory of Conformal Prediction. The methodology for calibration using reference outputs and semantic distance is sound. The primary limitation, explicitly acknowledged, is the reliance on a *heuristic* proxy score (\\\\\\\\hat{s}_j) based on self-consistency during the prediction phase. While plausible, this heuristic step means the formal 1-\\\\\\\\alpha coverage guarantee applies to an ideal set, not necessarily the constructed set S_{new}. However, the proposal correctly identifies this as a core assumption to be tested and plans extensive empirical validation and ablation studies (e.g., comparing proxy scores), which is a scientifically rigorous approach to handling such heuristics. Technical formulations are correct and clearly presented."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on accessible resources: LLM APIs, standard sentence embedding models, and common computational infrastructure. Suitable datasets are available, though curation might be needed. The algorithmic steps are computationally tractable (embedding, distance calculation, quantile estimation). The main potential challenge is the computational cost and API expense associated with generating k candidate responses per prompt, especially for large calibration and test sets. The proposal acknowledges this [Key Challenge 4] and plans to investigate the trade-off, which is a realistic approach. Overall, the plan is practical and implementable with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of ensuring reliability and quantifying uncertainty for black-box LLMs, a major bottleneck for their adoption in high-stakes applications [Task Description: safety, risk analysis]. By providing a method for generating semantically calibrated prediction sets, it directly tackles issues of overconfidence and hallucination [Key Challenge 1, 2]. Success would offer a valuable, practical tool for developers and auditors, enhancing AI safety [10] and trustworthiness without requiring access to model internals. The potential contribution to the statistical foundations of LLMs and practical AI deployment is substantial."
