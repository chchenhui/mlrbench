    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for statistical tools for black-box LLMs, focusing on conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification, safety, and risk analysis, as highlighted in the task. The methodology clearly operationalizes the research idea of using semantic embeddings within a conformal prediction framework. Furthermore, it situates the work effectively within the context of recent literature (cited in the review), acknowledging existing work on CP for LLMs and semantic approaches while proposing specific extensions (e.g., CoT)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally very clear, well-structured, and logically presented. The objectives, theoretical background (conformal prediction), proposed framework (SCP), and experimental design are articulated well. Key concepts are defined, and the overall approach is understandable. However, there is a minor lack of clarity in Section 2.2.4 (Prediction Set Construction) regarding how the nonconformity score s(X_{\\\\text{test}}, Y_{\\\\text{test},i}), defined using a reference answer Y_{\\\\text{ref}}, is calculated at test time when the true reference is unknown. While standard CP procedures exist for this, the proposal's description could be more explicit here. Similarly, the interaction between clustering and the final prediction set guarantee could be slightly clearer. Despite these minor points, the proposal is largely unambiguous and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. Applying conformal prediction to LLMs, including black-box settings and using semantic similarity, is an active area with several recent publications (as shown in the literature review, e.g., items 1, 4, 7, 10). The core idea of semantic conformal prediction is therefore not entirely groundbreaking and appears similar to very recent work (Lit Review item 10). The novelty lies more in the specific implementation choices (e.g., generating multiple candidates and clustering them based on semantic similarity before applying the conformal threshold) and the proposed extension to Chain-of-Thought reasoning, which offers a more fine-grained analysis. The comprehensive evaluation plan also adds value, but the fundamental concept builds heavily on existing work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on the sound theoretical foundation of conformal prediction, which provides distribution-free guarantees under the exchangeability assumption. The use of semantic distance as a nonconformity score is well-motivated and plausible for language tasks. The calibration procedure follows standard CP practices. The experimental design is rigorous, including multiple datasets, models, metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. Minor weaknesses exist in the lack of explicit detail on the test-time score calculation (as mentioned under Clarity) and the need for careful justification of how the clustering step interacts with the formal coverage guarantee. However, the overall approach is methodologically sound and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on accessible resources: black-box LLM APIs and standard sentence embedding models. The computational steps (inference, embedding, calibration, clustering) are standard ML/NLP operations, manageable with typical GPU resources, although generating multiple candidates per prompt increases cost. The main challenges are curating a high-quality, representative calibration dataset (which can be resource-intensive) and potentially managing the computational overhead for real-time applications. The ambitious experimental plan is feasible but requires significant effort. Overall, there are no fundamental roadblocks to implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: quantifying uncertainty and ensuring reliability for black-box LLMs. This is critical for deploying LLMs safely in high-stakes domains (healthcare, legal, finance), a key concern highlighted in the task description. Providing rigorous, distribution-free guarantees addresses a major gap in current practice. The semantic nature of the uncertainty measure enhances interpretability. Success would lead to major advancements in trustworthy AI, potentially impacting practical deployment, regulatory compliance, and scientific understanding of LLM limitations. The CoT extension could provide valuable insights into reasoning processes."
