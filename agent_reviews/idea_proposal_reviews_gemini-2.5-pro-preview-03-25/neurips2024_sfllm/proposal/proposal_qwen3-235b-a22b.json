        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for new statistical tools for black-box models, focusing specifically on conformal prediction for LLM uncertainty quantification, safety, and risk analysis – all key topics mentioned in the task. The methodology precisely implements the core research idea of using semantic similarity (cosine distance between prompt and candidate embeddings) as a nonconformity score within a conformal prediction framework. It effectively situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant works (ConU, Conformal Factuality, etc.) and explicitly addressing the challenges highlighted, such as the black-box nature of LLMs and the need for distribution-free guarantees."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology and expected outcomes. Key concepts like Semantic Conformal Prediction (SCP) and the nonconformity score are defined, and the core algorithms for calibration and prediction are presented. The experimental design is clearly outlined. Minor ambiguities exist: the exact calculation involving the true answer r_i in the calibration step could be slightly more explicit, and the adaptive scaling formula involving |\\Gamma_\\tau(p)| seems potentially circular or requires clarification on its practical computation. However, these points do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While conformal prediction for LLMs and the use of semantic similarity are existing concepts (as shown in the literature review), the specific combination proposed here – using prompt-output cosine similarity in embedding space as the primary nonconformity score for generating conformal sets for *general free-text generation* from *black-box* LLMs – offers a distinct approach. It contrasts with methods relying on self-consistency (ConU) or task-specific scores. The extensions to Chain-of-Thought reasoning via recursive SCP and the adaptive scaling mechanism further contribute to the novelty. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it builds on established CP principles, but the specific formulation and application context are innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, rooted in the well-established theoretical framework of conformal prediction, which provides distribution-free guarantees under exchangeability. The core CP algorithms are standard. However, the soundness hinges significantly on the effectiveness of the chosen semantic nonconformity score (1 - \\text{sim}_{\\cos}(E(p), E(\\hat{r}))). While intuitively plausible, the assumption that semantic similarity between prompt and output is a consistently reliable proxy for correctness across diverse tasks needs strong empirical validation; relevance might be captured, but factual correctness is not guaranteed by similarity alone. The quality and choice of the sentence encoder E are critical dependencies. The technical formulation is mostly clear, except for the adaptive scaling part mentioned under Clarity. The experimental plan is appropriate for validating the approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core methodology relies on standard components: LLM API access, pre-trained sentence embedding models (readily available), and standard conformal prediction calculations. Assembling the required calibration dataset (using public or synthetic data) is a common practice. The computational requirements for sampling, embedding, and scoring are manageable with typical research resources. Key risks include the performance dependency on the chosen sentence encoder and the quality of calibration data, but these are standard research challenges. The implementation of the core SCP seems straightforward, while the CoT extension presents a moderate increase in complexity but remains achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses a critical and pressing problem in AI: providing reliable uncertainty quantification for black-box LLMs to mitigate risks like hallucination and overconfidence. Developing methods with formal coverage guarantees, like CP, is crucial for deploying LLMs safely in high-stakes domains (healthcare, legal). Success would offer a practical tool for enhancing LLM trustworthiness and could impact regulatory auditing. The potential contribution of an open-source framework and insights into applying CP to generative models would be valuable to the research community. The alignment with improving AI safety and reliability makes the potential impact substantial."
