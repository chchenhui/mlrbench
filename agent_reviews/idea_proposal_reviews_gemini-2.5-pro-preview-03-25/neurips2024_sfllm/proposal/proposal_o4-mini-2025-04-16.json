        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for new statistical tools for black-box models, focusing specifically on conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, a key topic mentioned in the task description. The methodology closely follows the research idea, proposing semantic distance as a nonconformity score. It effectively situates itself within the provided literature, acknowledging related works (ConU, Conformal Language Modeling, etc.) while proposing a distinct approach based on task-agnostic semantic embeddings, addressing challenges highlighted in the review like overconfidence and the need for distribution-free guarantees."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-structured and clearly written. The objectives, calibration phase, and experimental design are well-defined. However, there is a significant lack of clarity and potential confusion in the definition of the nonconformity score used during the prediction phase (Section 3.3, step 3: s^k = \\\\min_{i\\\\le N} \\\\; d(\\\\phi(\\\\hat y^k),\\\\,\\\\phi(y_i))). It's unclear how this score s^k, which measures the distance of a *candidate* output \\\\hat{y}^k to the *closest calibration reference* y_i, relates theoretically to the threshold \\\\tau derived from the calibration scores S_i = A(x_i, y_i) = \\\\min_{k} d(\\\\phi(y_i), \\\\phi(\\\\hat{y}_i^k)). Standard conformal prediction would typically involve evaluating A(x_{test}, \\\\hat{y}^k) against \\\\tau. The proposed s^k seems like a different heuristic, and its theoretical justification for providing the 1-\\\\alpha coverage guarantee is not explained, creating a critical ambiguity in the core method."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty. While conformal prediction for LLMs and the use of semantic embeddings are explored in the literature (e.g., ConU, Conformal Language Modeling, and the conceptual papers by Davis/Brown, Green/Black), this proposal combines these ideas into a specific framework (SCPS) focused on using semantic distance as a *task-agnostic* nonconformity measure for *fully black-box* models. It differentiates itself from methods relying on self-consistency (ConU) or specific sampling rules (Conformal Language Modeling). The specific formulation, particularly the definition of the nonconformity scores and the overall SCPS algorithm, offers a novel contribution, although the prediction score's novelty might stem from its potential theoretical divergence."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal's soundness is questionable due to the methodology described in the prediction phase. While the calibration phase (Section 3.2) correctly follows standard conformal prediction principles to derive the threshold \\\\tau based on the score S_i = A(x_i, y_i), the prediction phase (Section 3.3) uses a different score s^k = \\\\min_{i} d(\\\\phi(\\\\hat y^k),\\\\,\\\\phi(y_i)). There is no provided theoretical justification showing that comparing this s^k to \\\\tau yields the claimed \\\\Pr(Y \\\\in \\\\mathcal C(X)) \\\\ge 1-\\\\alpha coverage guarantee. This disconnect between the score used for calibration (S_i) and the score used for prediction (s^k) represents a significant potential flaw in the core technical approach, undermining the rigor of the proposed method's guarantees. The reliance on the quality of the embedding model \\\\phi is also a factor, but the primary issue is the potentially incorrect application of the conformal prediction framework in the prediction step."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard components: black-box LLM APIs, pretrained sentence embedding models (like Sentence-BERT), and a calibration dataset of moderate size (500-5000 examples). The computational steps (sampling, embedding, distance calculation) are achievable. The potential bottleneck of comparing prediction candidates to all calibration embeddings is acknowledged, and a practical solution (using FAISS/Annoy for approximate nearest neighbors) is proposed. The main risk to feasibility is tied to the potential unsoundness; if the method doesn't empirically achieve coverage due to the theoretical issue, the project's goals wouldn't be met. However, the implementation itself is practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: providing reliable, distribution-free uncertainty quantification for black-box LLMs. This is crucial for enabling the safe deployment of LLMs in high-stakes applications (healthcare, law, finance), a major challenge currently limiting their use. The black-box nature makes the proposed method potentially widely applicable to commercial APIs. If successful (and sound), SCPS could offer a valuable tool for practitioners, enhancing trustworthiness, mitigating hallucinations, and facilitating auditing and risk management, thus having a substantial impact on the field."
