    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (focusing on black-box uncertainty quantification via conformal prediction for LLMs, safety, and risk), the research idea (semantic conformal prediction using embeddings and cosine distance), and the literature review (addressing identified challenges like overconfidence, UQ, score calibration, scalability, generalization based on recent CP+LLM work). It directly tackles the requested topic using the outlined approach and acknowledges relevant prior work and challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal's structure, objectives, and overall goal are relatively clear. However, there is a significant lack of clarity and potential flaw in the description of the core methodology, specifically regarding the calculation of the nonconformity score at test time. The proposal states 'Compute the nonconformity scores Δ(c_i, r) for each candidate c_i', implying access to the true reference output 'r' for the test prompt, which is generally unavailable. This ambiguity or error regarding how test-time scores are computed relative to the calibration threshold τ makes a crucial part of the methodology incomprehensible or unsound as described. Further details on data collection are also somewhat vague."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal combines existing concepts: conformal prediction, sentence embeddings (like SBERT), and cosine distance for uncertainty quantification in LLMs. While applying these specifically for semantic prediction sets in LLMs is relevant, the literature review itself points to very recent and similar work (e.g., Paper 7 on semantic embeddings for CP, Paper 10 on a semantic CP framework). The use of cosine distance in embedding space is standard. The novelty appears incremental, potentially lying in specific implementation details or the mentioned extension to Chain-of-Thought (which lacks detail). It doesn't present a groundbreaking concept compared to the cited 2023/2024 literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal relies on the statistically sound framework of conformal prediction. However, the methodological description of calculating the nonconformity score `Δ(c, r) = 1 - cos(E(c), E(r))` at test time appears fundamentally flawed, as the true reference `r` is unknown. Standard CP requires a score computable from the test input and candidate output alone. This error/ambiguity severely undermines the technical soundness of the proposed method as written. While using semantic distance is plausible, its reliability as a nonconformity measure requires empirical validation, which is standard, but the core scoring mechanism description is problematic."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Assuming the critical issue in the test-time scoring methodology is resolved or clarified, the proposal is largely feasible. Required components like pre-trained embedding models, LLM APIs, and standard CP algorithms are available. Data collection for calibration is a standard, achievable task. The computational steps (embedding, distance calculation) are generally efficient. The main risk stems from the current lack of clarity/soundness in the core method description, which needs correction before implementation is practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: ensuring the reliability and safety of black-box LLMs through robust uncertainty quantification. Reducing hallucinations and providing coverage guarantees, especially for high-stakes applications (healthcare, legal), is critical. Success in this research would represent a substantial contribution to the field and have significant practical impact, aligning perfectly with the need for statistical tools for modern AI systems."
