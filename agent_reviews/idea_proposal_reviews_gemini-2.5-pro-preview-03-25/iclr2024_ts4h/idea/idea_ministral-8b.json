        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (Workshop Call for Papers). It directly addresses 'Learning from Time Series for Health' by proposing a novel architecture ('Temporal Attention Network') for 'forecasting' health outcomes using 'multimodal' healthcare data ('wearables, EHRs, medical imaging'). It explicitly tackles key challenges mentioned in the CFP, such as 'high-dimensionality', 'missing values', 'noisy/irregular measurements', and 'explainability'. The focus on interpretability ('self-explanatory module', 'interpretable attention maps') is a listed topic of interest. The goal of making models 'practical and deployable for healthcare' resonates strongly with the workshop's motivation. While not explicitly framed under the central themes of 'Behavioral Health' or 'Foundation Models', it fits perfectly within the broader scope and listed topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main concept (TAN with attention for dynamic weighting and interpretability), methodology (preprocessing, architecture, training, explanation module), expected outcomes (accuracy, interpretability, robustness), and potential impact are all articulated concisely and logically. The core components and their purpose are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity. Minor details about the specific architecture might require further elaboration in a full paper, but the core research idea is presented with excellent clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While attention mechanisms and their use in time series (e.g., Transformers) are established, the specific proposal of a 'Temporal Attention Network' tailored for multimodal healthcare data, explicitly designed with a 'self-explanatory module' based on attention weights for interpretability in this context, offers notable innovation. It combines existing concepts (attention, time series modeling, interpretability) in a relevant way to address specific healthcare challenges. It's not a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift, but the focused application and integration for interpretable healthcare forecasting represent a fresh perspective compared to standard forecasting models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Attention mechanisms are well-understood and implementable using standard deep learning frameworks. Time series preprocessing techniques exist, although handling multimodal healthcare data with missing values and irregularities remains challenging but is a common research problem. Required computational resources are standard for deep learning research. Accessing and integrating diverse healthcare datasets (wearables, EHR, imaging) can be a significant hurdle due to privacy, standardization, and cleaning requirements, but it is achievable within research contexts. The core technical components are practical and implementable with current technology."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Accurate forecasting of health outcomes is crucial for proactive healthcare. The lack of interpretability is a major barrier to the adoption of complex ML models in clinical practice. By directly addressing explainability alongside forecasting accuracy and robustness to common data issues (noise, irregularity, multimodality), this research targets a critical need. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially leading to more trustworthy and deployable ML systems in healthcare, facilitating timely interventions and enhancing patient care, aligning perfectly with the goals stated in the task description."
