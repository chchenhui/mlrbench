    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges highlighted in the task description (irregular sampling, missing values, multimodality, foundation models, interpretability, uncertainty). The methodology follows the research idea precisely (CT-MAE, temporal kernels, value/timestamp masking, cross-modal reconstruction). It effectively situates itself within the provided literature, referencing relevant concepts like MAE, continuous-time models, and multi-modal learning, while aiming to tackle the identified key challenges. The focus on a foundation model for health time series fits perfectly with the workshop themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, significance, and overall approach (CT-MAE) are clearly articulated. The structure is logical. However, the methodology section, particularly the technical formulations for the encoder and decoder, remains high-level (e.g., 'CT-Transformer', 'Decoder'). More specific details on the learnable temporal kernels, the exact architecture of the continuous-time transformer, and the implementation of cross-modal attention would enhance clarity and remove minor ambiguities regarding the precise mechanisms."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing concepts (Masked Autoencoders, Continuous-Time Transformers, Cross-Modal Attention), the specific combination and application are innovative. The core novelty lies in synthesizing these elements into an 'Adaptive Continuous-Time Masked Autoencoder' that specifically targets irregularly sampled, multi-modal health data by using learnable temporal kernels within the MAE framework and employing a joint value/timestamp masking strategy across modalities. This represents a fresh approach compared to the cited literature, tailored to the unique challenges of health time series."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established machine learning concepts (Transformers, MAE, continuous-time modeling, attention). The rationale for combining these techniques to address the stated problems is logical and well-justified by the challenges in health time series. However, the lack of detailed technical formulations for the core components (encoder, decoder, kernels) prevents a higher score. While the high-level approach is sound, the specific mathematical and architectural details needed to fully assess rigor are missing."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Firstly, acquiring and harmonizing large-scale, multi-modal (EHR, ECG, wearables), multi-site health data is notoriously difficult due to privacy, access, and standardization issues. Secondly, pretraining a complex foundation model like the proposed CT-MAE requires substantial computational resources. Thirdly, the technical implementation itself, involving continuous-time mechanisms with learnable kernels and cross-modal attention, is complex and may require significant engineering effort and experimentation. These factors introduce considerable risks to successful execution."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical, unmet needs in modeling health time series data, which are central to advancing ML in healthcare as highlighted by the task description. Developing a robust foundation model capable of handling irregularity, missingness, and multimodality could lead to major improvements in various downstream clinical tasks (e.g., disease forecasting, treatment recommendations). The emphasis on interpretability and uncertainty estimation further enhances its potential clinical relevance and impact."
