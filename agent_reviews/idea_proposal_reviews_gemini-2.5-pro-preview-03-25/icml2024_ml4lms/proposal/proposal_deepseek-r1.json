    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on translational ML, specifically targeting 'dataset curation, analysis and benchmarking work highlighting opportunities and pitfalls' (Topic 1). The core concept perfectly matches the research idea of a dual-purpose AI for automated quality control. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (MoCL, GROVER, MOLGRAPHEVAL, persistent homology) while aiming to solve the key challenges identified, particularly data quality, evaluation, and domain knowledge integration. The proposal consistently weaves these elements together, showing a deep understanding of the context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The dual-network architecture, loss functions (including mathematical formulations), training protocol, and evaluation plan are explained with high precision. The structure is easy to follow, progressing naturally from problem statement to proposed solution and impact. The only minor point affecting perfect clarity is the mention of 'Figure 1' which is not included in the provided text, but this does not significantly hinder understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While utilizing existing concepts like self-supervised learning (SSL), GNNs/Transformers, and adversarial training (inspired by GANs), its application to automated *data curation and correction* in molecular datasets via a dual-network (curator/adversarial) system is innovative. The literature review primarily focuses on SSL for representation learning; this proposal repurposes and combines these ideas for a distinct task. The integration of domain-specific physical/chemical constraints directly into the curation loss function within this adversarial framework further enhances its novelty compared to standard SSL or rule-based curation methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates rigor. It is grounded in established ML principles (SSL, adversarial learning, GNNs) and relevant domain concepts (molecular validity checks). The proposed dual-network architecture and the corresponding loss functions (\\mathcal{L}_C, \\mathcal{L}_A) are well-reasoned and mathematically defined. The methodology includes sensible components like controlled data corruption, curriculum learning, and a comprehensive evaluation plan with appropriate metrics and baselines. Potential challenges like balancing losses or ensuring the differentiability/effectiveness of domain constraints exist but do not undermine the fundamental soundness of the approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It leverages existing technologies (GNNs, Transformers, standard datasets) and computational resources common in ML research. However, training a dual-network system, especially with an adversarial component, can be complex and prone to instability, requiring careful tuning. Effectively implementing and integrating diverse domain constraints (\\mathcal{L}_{domain}) across different molecular types (small molecules, proteins, crystals) adds complexity. Validating the system thoroughly across various error types and datasets will require significant effort. While achievable, the project demands substantial expertise and computational power, carrying moderate execution risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in ML for life and material sciences: the 'garbage in, garbage out' issue stemming from poor data quality. Reliable dataset curation is a critical bottleneck hindering the translation of ML models from research to real-world applications (industry). By aiming to automate and improve this process, the research has the potential for substantial impact, enhancing the reproducibility and reliability of scientific findings, accelerating drug and material discovery pipelines, and directly supporting the workshop's goal of bridging theory and industry applications. The potential benefits are clearly articulated and far-reaching."
