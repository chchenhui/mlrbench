        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Adversarial threats on LMMs' and 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs'. The proposed idea directly addresses these topics by investigating a novel cross-modal poisoning attack specifically designed for LMMs. It fits squarely within the workshop's focus on the intersection of AdvML and LMMs, particularly exploring vulnerabilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation outlines the gap (underexplored cross-modal poisoning in LMMs). The main idea clearly articulates the proposed attack ('Cross-Modal Semantic Poisoning'), the mechanism (poisoning modality A to affect modality B semantically), the methodology (crafting samples, training/fine-tuning, evaluation on clean prompts), and the objective (exposing vulnerabilities). It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While data poisoning itself is an established field, the specific focus on *cross-modal semantic* poisoning in the context of large multimodal models is innovative. It moves beyond typical poisoning attacks by exploring how manipulating one modality can corrupt the semantic understanding and generation capabilities related to another modality, even when the second modality's input is clean during inference. This targets the complex inter-modal dependencies unique to LMMs, offering a fresh perspective on their vulnerabilities."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. It relies on standard ML practices like dataset manipulation (crafting poisoned samples), model fine-tuning/training, and evaluation. Access to pre-trained LMMs or the resources to train smaller ones is required, which is common in current ML research. Designing effective 'subtle' poisons and measuring semantic shifts might require careful engineering and metric design, but there are no fundamental technological barriers. The methodology is practical and implementable with existing tools and knowledge, albeit potentially computationally intensive."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. LMMs are rapidly being deployed in various applications, making the understanding of their security vulnerabilities crucial. This research targets a potentially subtle yet dangerous vulnerability stemming from cross-modal interactions, which are fundamental to LMMs. Successfully demonstrating such attacks would highlight critical weaknesses in current training paradigms and data handling practices, directly informing the development of more robust models and necessary defense strategies. It addresses core concerns about the trustworthiness and safety of LMMs."
