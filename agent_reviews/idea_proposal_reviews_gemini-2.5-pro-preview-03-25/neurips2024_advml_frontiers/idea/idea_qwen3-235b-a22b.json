    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed for the AdvML-Frontiers'24 workshop, including 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs', 'Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs', and the overarching theme of 'AdvML for LMMs'. The motivation explicitly highlights the security risks in LMMs due to cross-modal interactions, which is a central focus of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core problem (cross-modal vulnerabilities), proposed solution (CM-GAT framework using a generator), key components (min-max optimization, contrastive loss), and evaluation plan are well-described. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific architecture of the generator or the exact formulation of the contrastive loss, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial training is established, applying it specifically to cross-modal vulnerabilities in LMMs using a *generative* approach to synthesize attacks is innovative. Using a multimodal generator within the training loop to learn and exploit inter-modal dependencies for attack generation, focusing on 'transferable' attacks, and integrating a contrastive loss represents a fresh perspective compared to standard unimodal adversarial training or simpler cross-modal attack studies."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training LMMs is computationally intensive, and the proposed CM-GAT framework adds complexity by requiring the training of a multimodal generator alongside the target LMM within a min-max optimization loop. Generating effective cross-modal adversarial examples and balancing the generator, discriminator (the LMM being trained), and contrastive loss components will require considerable effort, resources, and careful tuning. Success depends on access to powerful computing infrastructure and robust LMM backbones."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the security and robustness of LMMs against cross-modal attacks, which are often overlooked by traditional defenses. As LMMs become more prevalent in safety-critical applications, developing effective defenses like the proposed CM-GAT is crucial. Success could lead to major advancements in secure multimodal AI and establish new benchmarks for LMM robustness."
