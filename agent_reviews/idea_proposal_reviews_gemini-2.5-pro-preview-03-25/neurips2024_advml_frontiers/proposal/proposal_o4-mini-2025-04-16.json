    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the AdvML-Frontiers workshop, such as adversarial threats on LMMs, cross-modal vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies. The methodology precisely elaborates on the research idea's three-pronged approach (CMCV, MBAT, ARM). Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself as a unified framework addressing gaps identified in prior work (e.g., lack of unified verification, robustness at integration points, adaptation to diverse attacks) and tackling the key challenges summarized from the literature review."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are clearly articulated. The methodology section provides a good overview and details each component (CMCV, MBAT, ARM) with mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablations, is well-structured. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise architecture and training procedure for the ARM gating network (g_\\\\phi) and the specifics of implementing textual adversarial attacks (embedding vs. discrete). However, these do not significantly obscure the overall research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While individual components draw inspiration from existing work cited in the literature review (e.g., cross-modal consistency training like White et al., adaptive defense like Black et al., cross-modal adversarial training like Red et al./ProEAT), the primary novelty lies in the proposed *integration* of these elements into a single, unified framework (CMAI). The synergy between CMCV (detection), MBAT (proactive training), and ARM (reactive adaptation), particularly the idea of ARM using CMCV outputs to guide defense, presents a novel approach. The specific formulation of the modality-bridging loss (\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\\\\\mathrm{bridge}}) also adds a layer of novelty by directly targeting the alignment mechanism during attack generation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of adversarial machine learning (PGD-based adversarial training, min-max optimization) and multimodal representation learning (cosine similarity for alignment). The mathematical formulations for CMCV and the main MBAT objective are appropriate. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines (SOTA defenses like ProEAT), diverse metrics, ablation studies, and statistical validation. The methodology for MBAT, including specific attack generation techniques, is well-reasoned. The ARM component is conceptually sound, although its technical formulation (gating network details, training objective) is less detailed, slightly reducing the overall rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable challenges. Adversarial training for LMMs is inherently computationally expensive. While the proposal acknowledges this and suggests standard mitigation techniques (mixed-precision, gradient accumulation, partial fine-tuning), significant computational resources (GPU clusters, extensive training time) will likely be required. Integrating the three components (CMCV, MBAT, ARM) requires careful engineering. Training the ARM component effectively might pose difficulties. However, the use of standard benchmarks and established LMM architectures makes the core experiments achievable within a well-resourced research environment."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the security of Large Multimodal Models against cross-modal adversarial attacks. These vulnerabilities pose serious risks in safety-critical applications. Developing a unified, robust defense framework like CMAI has the potential for major impact, advancing the state-of-the-art in LMM security. The expected outcomes (substantial robustness gains, efficient detection, generalizability) are ambitious and, if achieved, would represent a significant contribution. The plan to release open-source code and models further enhances its potential impact on the research community and industry."
