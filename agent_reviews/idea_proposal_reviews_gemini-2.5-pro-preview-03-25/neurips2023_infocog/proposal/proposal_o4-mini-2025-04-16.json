    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the InfoCog workshop's focus on applying information-theoretic principles (specifically IB) to cognitive systems, particularly human-AI communication and cooperation. It systematically elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the IB formulation, RL integration, and evaluation strategy. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates insights and challenges from the provided literature review, citing relevant papers (e.g., Tucker et al., 2022; Srivastava et al., 2024) and positioning its contributions relative to them, particularly highlighting the adaptive aspect absent in some prior work. The emphasis on human cognitive load and interdisciplinary connections (IT, ML, CogSci) fits the task description perfectly."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to detailed methodology, validation, and expected impact. Key concepts like IB, VIB, and the RL integration are explained, and the mathematical formulations are presented. The objectives are specific and measurable. The experimental plan is well-described. Minor areas for potential refinement include a slightly more explicit connection between the IB trade-off parameter \\\\beta (which is adapted) and the regularization weight \\\\lambda used in the RL objective, and perhaps more concrete examples of 'task-relevant aspects' Y_t early on, although examples are provided later. Overall, the proposal is easily understandable and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While applying IB to communication or using VIB in RL is not entirely new (as acknowledged by citing Tucker et al., 2022; Islam et al., 2023), the key novelty lies in the specific combination and application: 1) Integrating VIB within an RL framework specifically for optimizing human-AI communication policies in cooperative tasks. 2) The proposed mechanism for *real-time adaptation* of the IB trade-off parameter (\\\\beta) based on *human cognitive feedback* (e.g., NASA-TLX). This dynamic adaptation tailored to the human user's state is a significant step beyond static IB applications. The planned comparison against recent, relevant baselines further helps delineate the novel contributions."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (IB, VIB, RL, PO-MDPs). The methodology, including the VIB approximation for mutual information and its integration as a regularizer within an actor-critic RL framework, is well-established and appropriate. The proposed adaptive mechanism for \\\\beta is plausible, although its theoretical convergence properties are not detailed (which is acceptable at the proposal stage). The experimental design is rigorous, featuring both simulation and human-subject studies with appropriate metrics, baselines, and statistical analysis plans. Technical formulations appear correct. The link between optimizing the IB loss and the augmented RL objective is implicitly sound but could be slightly more formally connected."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Implementing VIB within standard deep RL frameworks is achievable using existing libraries. Developing the specified simulation environments (Unity3D) is standard practice. The adaptive \\\\beta mechanism is computationally inexpensive to implement. The main challenge lies in the human-subject experiments (N=30-50), which require significant logistical planning (IRB, recruitment, execution, data analysis) but are standard in HCI/HRI research. Potential risks include RL training stability and the effectiveness of the sim-to-real transfer (or sim-to-human transfer), but these are common research challenges rather than fundamental infeasibilities. The plan is realistic, assuming access to standard computational resources and facilities for user studies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: improving the efficiency and effectiveness of communication in human-AI teams. Information overload and miscommunication are major barriers to successful collaboration. By proposing a principled (IB-based) and adaptive approach that considers human cognitive load, the research has the potential for substantial impact. Successful outcomes could lead to more efficient task completion, reduced human frustration, increased trust, and broader adoption of AI in collaborative settings (healthcare, manufacturing, etc.). The work's interdisciplinary nature also promises contributions to ML, IT, and cognitive science, aligning well with the workshop's goals. The plan to release code and data further enhances its potential impact."
