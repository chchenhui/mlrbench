    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description (InfoCog workshop themes), the research idea (using IB for human-AI communication), and the literature review (building upon and differentiating from prior work like IMAC, VQ-VIB, and general IB in RL). It directly addresses the workshop's call for information-theoretic approaches to cognitive functions (communication), validation methods (human studies), computation/estimation of IT quantities (VIB), and application to human-aligned agents. The problem statement, objectives, and methodology directly reflect the core research idea, and the significance section explicitly connects the work to the workshop's goals and the provided literature context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, problem statement, objectives, methodology, and evaluation plan are articulated concisely and logically. The mathematical formulation using IB and VIB is presented clearly, as are the algorithmic steps. The experimental design, including baselines and metrics, is specific. Minor areas that could benefit from slight elaboration (perhaps in a longer document) include the precise operationalization of the relevance variable 'Y' for different tasks and the exact mechanism for balancing the RL and VIB losses, but these do not detract significantly from the overall excellent clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing work applying IB to communication (Wang et al., 2020; Tucker et al., 2022) and representation learning in RL (Islam et al., 2023), its novelty lies in the specific synthesis and application: explicitly using the IB compression term (I(X; Z)) as a formal objective to model and minimize human cognitive load within a cooperative human-AI RL framework. The focus on validating this link through human-centric metrics (cognitive load, clarity, trust) alongside task performance and IT measures distinguishes it from prior work that focused more on agent-agent communication or general emergent communication properties. It offers a fresh perspective on designing human-aligned communication protocols."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations (Information Theory - IB, RL, POMDPs) and utilizes well-established methods (VIB for tractable IB optimization, Actor-Critic RL). The proposed methodology, integrating VIB into the RL objective to shape communication, is technically robust. The mathematical formulation appears correct. The experimental plan is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, ablation studies, and both simulation and human subject validation. Potential challenges, such as defining the relevance variable 'Y' and the assumption linking I(X; Z) to cognitive load, are implicitly or explicitly acknowledged and are part of the research questions to be investigated, rather than fundamental flaws."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Implementing VIB within deep RL frameworks is complex but achievable using standard ML libraries and hardware. Suitable simulation environments (like Overcooked-AI) exist. While conducting rigorous human subject studies requires significant resources (time, funding, ethics approval, participant recruitment), it is a standard methodology in HRI/HCI. The main risks involve implementation complexity, hyperparameter tuning (especially balancing RL and VIB objectives), and the inherent challenges of human studies, but these are manageable research risks rather than fundamental roadblocks. The scope is ambitious but realistic for a focused research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the communication bottleneck in human-AI collaboration. Improving communication efficiency and tailoring it to human cognitive limits has the potential for major impact across numerous applications (e.g., autonomous systems, assistive robotics, collaborative analysis). The research promises substantial scientific contributions by advancing the use of information theory (IB) for designing human-aligned AI and providing a formal framework for communication optimization. It directly aligns with critical goals in AI alignment and HRI. Successful execution could lead to demonstrably better human-AI teams and more trustworthy, usable AI systems."
