    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on AutoRL by integrating LLMs, Meta-Learning, and AutoML concepts to tackle the brittleness of RL. The core idea aligns perfectly with the provided 'HyperPrompt' concept, aiming to use LLMs for dynamic hyperparameter adaptation. It explicitly references and builds upon the challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as dynamic hyperparameter landscapes (Mohan et al., 2023) and the importance of HPO (Eimer et al., 2023), proposing a novel LLM-based solution."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, flowing from introduction and motivation to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology section clearly outlines the system architecture, LLM training process (dataset, prompts, fine-tuning), adaptation mechanism (including mathematical formulations for updates and safety), and a comprehensive experimental design. The language is precise and technical concepts are explained well, making it immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using LLMs in AutoML (like OptFormer) or as RL agents exists, the core idea of employing an LLM as a *real-time meta-controller* for *dynamic* hyperparameter adaptation based on rich contextual information (trajectories, metrics history) during RL training is a novel approach. Framing this within meta-reinforcement learning adds another layer of novelty. It clearly distinguishes itself from static HPO, traditional dynamic methods (like PBT), and offline LLM-based optimization by focusing on in-training, context-aware adaptation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in relevant literature concerning RL hyperparameter challenges and AutoRL. The methodology is well-thought-out, including dataset generation strategy, prompt engineering considerations, a defined LLM fine-tuning objective, and a specific adaptation mechanism with safety constraints. The meta-RL formulation provides a solid theoretical underpinning. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring diverse environments, strong baselines, relevant metrics, and ablation studies. Technical formulations for prompts and updates are presented clearly. Minor uncertainties exist around the practical effectiveness of encoding complex RL dynamics into prompts and the quality achievable in the meta-dataset, but the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The required technologies (RL libraries, LLMs, fine-tuning frameworks) are available. However, generating the large, diverse meta-training dataset will be computationally intensive, requiring numerous RL runs across varied settings. Fine-tuning large LLMs also demands significant compute resources. The real-time inference cost of the LLM during RL training could impact overall wall-clock time, potentially negating some sample efficiency gains if not managed carefully. While ambitious, the plan is detailed and seems achievable for a well-equipped research group, acknowledging the resource requirements and potential implementation hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in RL: the difficulty and brittleness associated with hyperparameter tuning. Successfully automating dynamic adaptation could drastically improve RL's sample efficiency, robustness, and accessibility, lowering the barrier for practical application ('democratization'). The research bridges LLMs, RL, AutoML, and meta-learning, potentially fostering cross-disciplinary innovation as highlighted in the task description. The expected contributions—a novel framework, empirical gains, representation techniques, and deeper insights into RL dynamics—are substantial."
