        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on AutoRL by integrating LLMs, meta-learning, and AutoML concepts to tackle hyperparameter optimization in RL. The proposal explicitly references and aims to solve key challenges identified in the literature review (dynamic landscapes, HPO cost, generalization, LLM integration, benchmarking) and aligns perfectly with the provided research idea for 'HyperPrompt'. It fits squarely within the workshop's targeted areas, such as 'LLMs for reinforcement learning', 'Meta-reinforcement learning', 'AutoML for reinforcement learning', and 'Hyperparameter importance for RL algorithms'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives (Dynamic Adaptation, Sample Efficiency, Generalization) are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides substantial detail on data collection, prompt engineering, the meta-training framework (including the POMDP formulation and hybrid loss), and a comprehensive experimental design. The rationale is well-articulated. While generally clear, some aspects, like the precise mechanics of the RL optimization loop for the LLM policy over hyperparameters or the potential impact of hyperparameter discretization, could benefit from slightly more elaboration. However, the core concepts and plan are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. The core idea of using a pretrained LLM as a meta-controller for *dynamic*, *real-time* hyperparameter adaptation in RL based on trajectory snippets is a significant departure from existing static HPO methods (like OptFormer or Bayesian Optimization) and other LLM-RL integrations (like ReMA's focus on meta-reasoning). Framing this as an LLM prompt prediction task combined with a meta-RL POMDP formulation, optimized via a hybrid loss, represents a novel technical approach. The proposal clearly articulates its distinction from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (meta-learning, POMDPs, LLMs, HPO challenges in RL) and cites relevant recent literature. The proposed methodology is detailed and technically plausible, including data collection, prompt design, LLM fine-tuning (LoRA), and a hybrid training objective. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring strong baselines (OptFormer, PBT), diverse environments (Procgen, NetHack, MuJoCo), relevant metrics, ablations, and even theoretical considerations (attention head analysis). Minor weaknesses include the inherent complexity and potential instability of the hybrid LLM training and the reliance on hyperparameter discretization, but the overall approach is well-justified and rigorous."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant engineering challenges. It leverages existing technologies (pretrained LLMs, RL libraries, benchmarks like ARLBench) and proposes efficiency measures (LoRA, ARLBench). The plan is detailed and broken down. However, collecting diverse, high-quality meta-training data across many RL tasks is resource-intensive. Fine-tuning the LLM effectively with the proposed hybrid loss and ensuring stable dynamic adaptation requires careful implementation and tuning. While the proposal acknowledges computational overhead and aims to minimize it, the overall resource requirement (compute for data generation and LLM training) will likely be substantial. The risks associated with training stability and generalization are non-trivial but manageable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and pervasive problem of hyperparameter tuning in RL, a major barrier to its wider adoption. Successfully developing a system for dynamic, automated hyperparameter adaptation could dramatically improve RL agent robustness, sample efficiency, and convergence speed, while reducing manual effort. This would represent a major advancement in AutoRL. The potential to democratize RL by making it more 'out-of-the-box' is substantial. Furthermore, it explores a novel application of LLMs in a control context, contributing to both the LLM and RL fields and directly fostering the cross-community collaboration sought by the workshop."
