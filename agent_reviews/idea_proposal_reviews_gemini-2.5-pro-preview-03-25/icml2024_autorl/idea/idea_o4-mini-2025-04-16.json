        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly focuses on 'Automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL)', 'Meta-Learning', 'AutoML for reinforcement learning', and 'Hyperparameter agnostic RL algorithms'. HyperG directly addresses the challenge of hyperparameter tuning in RL (a core AutoRL problem) using a meta-learning approach to create a hyperparameter generator, aiming for hyperparameter-agnostic RL. It fits squarely within the workshop's stated goals and focus areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (costly tuning), the core concept (meta-learned generator mapping environment embeddings to hyperparameters), the training mechanism (meta-learning loop with gradient updates based on task performance), and the goal (one-shot hyperparameter prediction) are explicitly and concisely articulated. The validation plan is also mentioned. There are no significant ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization are established fields, the specific concept of training a dedicated neural generator (HyperG) to map environment embeddings directly to a *full set* of RL hyperparameters using performance gradients from short RL rollouts within a meta-learning framework appears innovative. It offers a fresh approach compared to standard HPO techniques (grid search, Bayesian optimization) or meta-learning algorithms that adapt policies directly. It's a novel combination and application of existing concepts tailored to the AutoRL challenge."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires a diverse set of environments for meta-training (available), implementing the generator network (straightforward), and the meta-learning loop. The main challenge lies in efficiently and effectively propagating performance gradients back through the RL training process (which involves non-differentiable environment interactions) to update the hyperparameter generator. This might require techniques like policy gradients on the meta-level or approximations, adding complexity. However, similar meta-learning setups exist, making it achievable within a research context, albeit requiring significant engineering."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Hyperparameter tuning is a well-known, major bottleneck hindering the practical application and reproducibility of RL. Successfully developing a system like HyperG that can predict near-optimal hyperparameters for new tasks in one shot would be a major advancement for AutoRL. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of making RL work 'out-of-the-box', potentially democratizing RL and accelerating its adoption in real-world scenarios where extensive tuning is impractical."
