        "justification": "The idea aligns perfectly with the task description. It directly addresses 'AI for therapeutic RNAs (e.g., optimizing UTR/codons to enhance translational efficiency for mRNA vaccines)' from the Application Track. Furthermore, it heavily incorporates elements from the ML Track, including the 'Usage of FMs for agents in drug discovery', 'Method that bridges the gap between FMs and design', 'New AI-driven design approaches (e.g., utilizing various representations such as primary/tertiary structures of RNAs, employing state-of-the-art RL)', 'Large-scale predictive/generative models for new modalities (e.g., modeling multimodal aspects such as DNA/RNA/protein or 2D/3D structures)', 'Fine-tuning foundational models from lab feedback', and 'Interpretability in foundational models'. The proposal hits nearly every relevant keyword and theme mentioned in the task description related to FMs, RNA design, multimodality, RL, and interpretability."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem and the proposed solution's value. The main idea details the core components: the multimodal FM, the types of data, the modeling approach (joint sequence/structure, cross-attention), the RL framework with experimental feedback, the interpretability module, and the expected outcomes (including quantitative targets). The flow is logical and easy to understand. Minor details about specific model architectures or datasets are understandably omitted at this stage, but the overall concept is articulated with excellent precision."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While foundational models, reinforcement learning, and interpretability methods exist individually, their synergistic integration for multimodal therapeutic RNA design guided by experimental feedback is novel. Specifically, training an FM on diverse biological data types (sequence, structure, functional assays like Ribo-seq) for generative RNA design, coupling it with an RL loop using real lab data as reward, and adding an interpretability layer to extract design rules represents a significant step beyond current standard practices. It combines several cutting-edge concepts in a fresh way for this specific application."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Key hurdles include: 1) Acquiring and integrating large-scale, diverse, high-quality multimodal biological datasets. 2) The substantial computational resources required for training large multimodal FMs. 3) The practical implementation of the RL loop involving iterative *in vitro* synthesis and testing, which can be time-consuming and expensive, potentially creating a bottleneck. 4) Accurately modeling RNA 3D structure alongside sequence and function remains complex. 5) Ensuring the interpretability methods yield genuinely reliable biological insights. While conceptually sound, successful execution requires significant resources, interdisciplinary expertise (ML, bioinformatics, wet lab), and overcoming potential bottlenecks in the experimental feedback cycle."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Optimizing therapeutic RNA design is critical for the success of mRNA vaccines, RNAi therapies, and other RNA-based treatments, a rapidly growing field. Current methods are often inefficient. Achieving a 2-5x increase in translation efficiency, as targeted, would be a major advancement. Furthermore, generating interpretable design rules (e.g., for UTRs) would provide fundamental biological insights and accelerate future design efforts. Success would not only improve specific therapies but could also establish a powerful, reusable AI-driven pipeline for optimizing other complex biological modalities, representing a major contribution to AI in drug discovery."
