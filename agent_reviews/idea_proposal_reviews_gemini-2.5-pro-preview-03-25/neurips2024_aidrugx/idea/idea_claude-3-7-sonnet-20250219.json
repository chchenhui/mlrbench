        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses 'AI for therapeutic RNAs' by proposing optimization of codons and UTRs for translational efficiency and stability. It incorporates 'Foundational Models' (albeit specialized ones) and 'state-of-the-art RL' for design, fitting both the Application and ML tracks. It also touches upon 'designing delivery systems' through the cell-type specificity module. The focus on mRNA therapeutics is central to the workshop's theme of AI for new drug modalities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main components (codon opt, UTR design, function prediction, cell-type specificity), and the overarching approach (multi-objective RL) are understandable. However, details regarding the specific nature of the 'specialized foundational models', the exact mechanism of RL integration (state/action space, reward formulation), and how tissue tropism is precisely modeled and optimized could be more defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the implementation specifics."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While AI methods for individual aspects like codon optimization or UTR design exist, the proposed novelty lies in the holistic integration of multiple specialized models covering translation, stability, immunogenicity, degradation, and delivery within a single multi-objective reinforcement learning framework specifically for mRNA design. This comprehensive, simultaneous optimization approach using RL appears innovative compared to optimizing components in isolation or using simpler optimization techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing individual modules (codon opt, UTR design, function prediction) is achievable with existing techniques and data. However, integrating these diverse predictive models into a cohesive multi-objective RL framework is complex and computationally intensive. A major challenge lies in acquiring sufficient high-quality, multi-modal data, especially for predicting *in vivo* aspects like tissue tropism and degradation kinetics accurately. Tuning the complex RL reward function to balance multiple objectives effectively will also require considerable effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Optimizing mRNA therapeutics is a critical challenge in modern medicine, impacting vaccines and therapies for numerous diseases. A successful RNA-GUIDE framework could dramatically accelerate the design cycle, reduce experimental costs, and lead to more potent, stable, and targeted mRNA drugs. It addresses a key bottleneck in a rapidly growing field with substantial potential for clinical and commercial impact."
