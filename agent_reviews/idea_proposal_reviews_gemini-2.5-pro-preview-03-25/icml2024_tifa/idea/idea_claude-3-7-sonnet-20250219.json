        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly lists 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking' as a key topic under 'Trustworthy Multi-modal Foundation Models and AI Agents (TiFA)'. The idea directly addresses this by proposing a cross-modal watermarking framework specifically for content generated by multi-modal models, which are central to the task description. It tackles issues like misinformation and accountability, which are core concerns for trustworthy AI systems mentioned in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main goal, and the three key innovations (modal-invariant encoding, hierarchical patterns, self-supervised optimization) are clearly presented. The use of frequency domain transformations is specified. However, the exact mechanism for achieving 'modal-invariant watermark encoding' that survives transformations like text-to-speech or image-to-text could be elaborated further for perfect clarity, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While watermarking for AI content exists, the focus on robust *cross-modal* watermarking, specifically designed to survive transformations *between* modalities (e.g., text-to-speech, image-to-text), represents a significant advancement over single-modality or intra-modality approaches. The proposed combination of modal-invariant encoding using frequency domains, hierarchical patterns, and self-supervised learning for robustness constitutes a fresh approach to a challenging problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Embedding watermarks in frequency domains and using self-supervised learning are established techniques. However, achieving truly robust 'modal-invariant' watermarks that reliably survive complex transformations between fundamentally different data types (like text to audio or image to text) is technically very challenging and largely unproven. The success heavily depends on developing novel encoding schemes that preserve information across these drastic transformations, which may require considerable research effort and might face fundamental limitations. Practical implementation might also depend on integration with or access to the internals of various MFMs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully developing a robust cross-modal watermarking system would address a critical and growing problem: the inability to reliably distinguish AI-generated content, especially as it proliferates across different media formats. This capability is crucial for combating misinformation, protecting copyright, ensuring accountability, and building overall trust in AI systems and the information ecosystem. It directly contributes to the goals of the TiFA task by providing a technical mechanism for transparency and identification."
