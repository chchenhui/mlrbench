        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly lists 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking' as a key topic under 'Trustworthy Multi-modal Foundation Models and AI Agents (TiFA)'. The proposal directly addresses this by developing a novel watermarking technique specifically for multi-modal foundation models (MFMs), which are central to the task description (mentioning both MLLMs and MMGMs). It also touches upon related task goals like accountability, regulation (EU AI Act), mitigating harms (misinformation, deepfakes), and addressing novel safety challenges introduced by new modalities, all contributing to the overarching theme of trustworthy AI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, the core problem (limitations of existing watermarks for multi-modal content), and the proposed solution (dynamic, cross-modal watermarking using alignment signatures via contrastive learning) are well-defined. Key components like the injection mechanism (differentiable module) and detection method (lightweight verifier) are described conceptually. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise mathematical formulation of 'alignment signatures' or the specifics of the contrastive training objective for watermarking robustness, but the overall research direction and methodology are understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While AI watermarking exists, this proposal introduces several novel aspects: 1) The core concept of using 'multi-modal alignment signatures' learned via contrastive methods to bind watermarks across different modalities (e.g., text prompt to generated video) is innovative and directly addresses the challenge of multi-modal content. 2) The dynamic embedding into latent representations during generation, coupled with training for robustness against specific attacks, goes beyond simpler static watermarks. 3) The focus on a lightweight, model-agnostic verifier checking cross-modal consistency is also a valuable contribution. It offers a fresh approach compared to modality-specific or less robust techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Key challenges include: 1) Requiring access to the internal latent representations and generation process of MFMs, which might be difficult for closed-source models. 2) The technical complexity of designing and integrating a differentiable, modality-agnostic watermarking module that works across diverse MFM architectures. 3) Effectively training this module using contrastive learning to achieve robust cross-modal binding without significantly degrading generation quality is non-trivial. 4) Ensuring the lightweight verifier is truly robust and reliable across different content types and manipulations requires careful design and extensive testing. Significant computational resources and expertise would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. The proliferation of sophisticated multi-modal AI-generated content poses serious risks (misinformation, deepfakes, IP infringement). Developing robust methods to identify such content is a critical need for platforms, regulators, and society. This proposal directly addresses this need by tackling the limitations of existing watermarking techniques for multi-modal scenarios. A successful outcome could provide a crucial technical tool for content provenance, enhancing trust, enabling accountability, supporting regulatory compliance (like the EU AI Act mentioned), and mitigating the misuse of powerful generative models. The potential impact on AI safety and governance is substantial."
