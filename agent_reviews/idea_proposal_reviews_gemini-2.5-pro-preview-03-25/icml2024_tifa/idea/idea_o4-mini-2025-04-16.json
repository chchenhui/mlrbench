        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses a key topic listed in the task description: 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking'. It focuses on Multi-modal Foundation Models (MFMs), specifically Multi-modal Generative Models (MMGMs) like Sora and combinations like LLava+Stable Diffusion, which are explicitly mentioned as relevant systems in the task description. The goal of enhancing trust, curbing misuse, and providing tools for content authenticity aligns perfectly with the overall objective of building 'Trustworthy Multi-modal Foundation Models and AI Agents (TiFA)'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly. The motivation outlines the problem (lack of robust cross-modal watermarks for MFMs) effectively. The main idea details the proposed solution (CrossModMark), including the core technical approach (shared watermark in joint latent space, encoder/detector, contrastive objectives, adversarial training), target models, evaluation metrics, expected outcomes, and integration method (plug-in API). The concepts are well-defined and articulated with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While watermarking itself is not new, the proposed approach focuses on a *unified, shared* watermark embedded in the *joint latent space* of MFMs, designed to be *modality-agnostic* upon detection. Combining this with contrastive learning for the detector and adversarial training specifically for robustness against cross-modal transformations represents a novel synthesis of techniques applied to the specific challenge of watermarking diverse outputs from a single MFM. It moves beyond single-modality or simple concatenation approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Implementing watermark embedding during MFM training requires access to model architectures and training pipelines, which is possible for open-source models but potentially difficult for proprietary ones like Sora (though fine-tuning or applying to outputs might be alternatives). Developing the encoder/detector and implementing contrastive/adversarial training are standard ML practices. Achieving the claimed high robustness (>95% detection) across diverse modalities and strong attacks while maintaining low utility loss (<1%) is ambitious and requires significant empirical validation. The 'lightweight' nature and 'plug-in API' enhance feasibility if achieved."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance. As MFMs proliferate, the ability to reliably identify AI-generated multi-modal content is crucial for combating deepfakes, misinformation, and malicious use. A robust, cross-modal watermarking standard would be a major contribution to AI safety, content moderation, and regulatory efforts. It directly addresses the need for technical mechanisms to enhance the trustworthiness of increasingly powerful generative models, potentially having a substantial positive impact."
