    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on practical FL challenges like fine-tuning foundation models, scalability, resource constraints, and personalization. The proposal accurately reflects the core research idea of using PEFT in FL (FedPEFT) to reduce communication/computation costs and handle heterogeneity. It clearly positions itself within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging existing work on PEFT in FL (like SLoRA, FeDeRA, FedP^2EFT, etc.) and aiming to build upon it by focusing on adaptive allocation and novel aggregation, addressing key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, outlining the motivation, objectives, methodology, and expected impact logically. The research objectives are distinct, and the overall research design is understandable. However, the descriptions of the core novel contributions – 'adaptive PEFT module allocation' strategies and 'novel aggregation strategies' – lack specific detail. The mathematical formulations provided are overly simplistic (standard gradient descent and FedAvg) and do not reflect the proposed novelty in aggregation or adaptation, leaving ambiguity about the technical specifics. The privacy/security analysis plan is also mentioned but not elaborated upon."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the core concept of applying PEFT techniques in FL to fine-tune large models is not entirely new (as evidenced by the literature review, including a 2022 paper also titled FedPEFT by Sun et al., SLoRA, FeDeRA, etc.), the proposal suggests specific novel contributions in adaptive PEFT module allocation based on device/data characteristics and novel aggregation strategies for PEFT updates. These aspects offer potential for originality beyond standard PEFT-FL implementations. However, the lack of detail on *how* these adaptive allocations and novel aggregations will work makes it difficult to fully assess their innovativeness compared to related works like FedP^2EFT (personalized structure selection) or methods addressing heterogeneity. The reuse of the name 'FedPEFT' also slightly diminishes the perceived novelty without clear differentiation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has weaknesses in technical rigor. The motivation is well-founded on the challenges of FL for FMs, and the general methodology (combining PEFT and FL) is reasonable. The research design follows standard practices. However, the technical depth is lacking, particularly concerning the novel components. The mathematical formulations are rudimentary and don't support the claims of novel aggregation. The specific mechanisms for adaptive allocation are not described. The plan for privacy/security analysis is mentioned but not detailed. While the experimental design covers relevant comparisons, relying solely on synthetic data might limit the robustness of the findings without careful justification and design."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Implementing PEFT methods within an FL framework is achievable using existing libraries and pre-trained models. The research steps are logical. Simulating heterogeneous devices and data distributions is standard practice in FL research, although creating highly realistic simulations requires care. The main challenges lie in the successful development and empirical validation of the *novel* adaptive allocation and aggregation strategies, which require significant algorithmic design and experimentation. The computational resources needed for experiments with FMs, even with PEFT, will be substantial but are generally accessible in research labs."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and timely problem: enabling the use of powerful foundation models in practical federated learning scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge devices while preserving privacy. Successfully reducing communication and computation overhead through PEFT, adapting to device capabilities, and handling heterogeneity would represent a major advancement for deploying large models in decentralized settings. This directly aligns with the workshop's goal of bridging theory and practice for real-world impact."
