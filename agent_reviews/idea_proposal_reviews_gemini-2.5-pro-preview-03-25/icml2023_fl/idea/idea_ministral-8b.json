    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop task description. It directly addresses key themes like 'Scalable and robust federated machine learning systems', 'personalizing models in federated settings', 'Autotuned federated algorithms for hyperparameters', and the overall goal of bridging the gap between theory and practice in FL. The focus on scalability, real-time personalization, and practical challenges aligns perfectly with the workshop's objectives."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main components (distributed aggregation, adaptive learning rates, real-time data fusion, automated hyperparameter tuning), expected outcomes, and potential impact are clearly stated. However, the descriptions of the proposed mechanisms (e.g., the specific nature of the 'lightweight' aggregation or 'real-time data fusion') lack technical detail, leaving some ambiguity about the precise methods to be employed. Minor refinements specifying the core technical innovations would improve clarity further."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While the individual components (scalable aggregation, adaptive learning rates, data fusion, hyperparameter tuning in FL) are existing areas of research, the proposed novelty lies in their integration into a cohesive system specifically targeting *real-time* personalization at scale. The combination and focus are relevant, but the description doesn't explicitly detail groundbreaking techniques for each component compared to prior art. The novelty appears to be more in the system architecture and application focus rather than fundamentally new algorithms, based on the provided text."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing and integrating lightweight aggregation, adaptive learning rates, real-time data fusion, and automated hyperparameter tuning into a single, robust, and scalable system is complex. Achieving real-time performance across potentially thousands of diverse devices with varying capabilities and network conditions requires substantial engineering effort and potentially novel algorithmic solutions not fully detailed here. Access to appropriate simulation environments or real-world testbeds would also be crucial and potentially difficult to secure."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Addressing scalability and enabling real-time personalization are critical challenges hindering the widespread practical adoption of Federated Learning. Success in this research could lead to meaningful advancements in deploying FL for impactful applications in domains like healthcare, finance, and retail, directly contributing to bridging the theory-practice gap highlighted by the workshop. The emphasis on privacy further enhances its significance."
