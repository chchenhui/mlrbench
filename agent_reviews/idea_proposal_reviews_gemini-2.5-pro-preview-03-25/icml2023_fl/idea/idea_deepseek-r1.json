        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on 'Training, fine-tuning, and personalizing (foundation) models in federated settings' and 'Scalable and robust federated machine learning systems'. This proposal directly addresses the scalability challenge of fine-tuning foundation models in FL by using PEFT, aiming to bridge the gap between large models and practical FL deployment, which is central to the workshop's theme of connecting theory and practice for real-world impact."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (resource constraints of FL for foundation models), the proposed solution (combining PEFT like LoRA/adapters with FL), the mechanism (client-side adapter training, server aggregation), and the evaluation plan (communication, accuracy, robustness). The expected outcome is quantified. Minor details like the specifics of 'dynamic aggregation strategies' could be further elaborated, but the core concept is immediately understandable and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. While combining PEFT methods with FL is an emerging area with some existing work (e.g., FedLoRA), applying this specifically to large-scale foundation models to overcome practical deployment barriers, potentially exploring dynamic aggregation strategies and providing a comprehensive evaluation, still offers valuable contributions. It's more of a novel application and refinement of recent techniques to address a critical, timely problem rather than a fundamentally new paradigm, but it tackles a significant gap in practical FL."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. PEFT techniques (LoRA, adapters) are well-established, and FL simulation frameworks are available. Pre-trained foundation models can be accessed. The core technical challenge lies in integrating these components efficiently and evaluating them systematically. Potential hurdles include managing client resource constraints (even adapters require computation on the base model) and effectively handling statistical heterogeneity during adapter aggregation, but these seem like addressable research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks. Implementation is practical with standard ML research resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Foundation models represent the state-of-the-art in many domains, but their centralized training and fine-tuning limit applicability in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained decentralized settings. Enabling efficient federated fine-tuning of these models via PEFT would be a major advancement, unlocking applications in personalized AI, on-device intelligence, and collaborative research across organizations without sharing raw data. It addresses a critical bottleneck preventing the widespread adoption of FL for cutting-edge AI models."
