    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key topics from the task description, such as long-context instruction following, training efficiency, data collection (synthetic generation), and evaluation. It thoroughly elaborates on the core research idea of Dynamic Context Windows (DCW), detailing its motivation, mechanism, and expected benefits. Furthermore, it effectively integrates the literature review, positioning DCW relative to existing efficient Transformer methods (Longformer, LongLoRA, etc.) and adaptive attention techniques, while clearly articulating its unique instruction-driven focus and addressing the challenges identified in the review (computational complexity, attention limitations)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The problem statement, proposed solution (DCW), research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely and without ambiguity. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the theoretical framework, architecture options, implementation plan, data strategy, and experimental design. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the entire research plan immediately understandable. Minor technical details (e.g., exact form of the learned function 'f' or the adaptive mask) are understandably left for the implementation phase but the overall concept and approach are perfectly clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing work in efficient Transformers and adaptive attention, the core novelty lies in making the attention mechanism dynamically adaptive based *specifically on the input instruction's semantics* when processing long contexts. This instruction-driven adaptation distinguishes it from static sparse patterns (e.g., Longformer) or attention spans learned independent of the specific task instruction (e.g., Adaptive Attention Span). The proposed two-phase architecture involving an explicit or implicit instruction-relevance assessment module is a fresh approach to optimizing attention for instruction following in long documents. The novelty is clearly articulated and justified against prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in the established Transformer architecture and leverages well-understood concepts like sparse attention and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The proposed methodology is robust, featuring a logical two-phase architecture, consideration of multiple implementation options for relevance prediction, a comprehensive data collection strategy (though challenging), and a rigorous experimental design with strong baselines, diverse tasks, relevant metrics, and planned ablation studies. The theoretical framework is conceptually solid, and potential risks are identified with appropriate mitigation strategies. The technical formulations are clear and correct for a proposal stage."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning data generation. Creating a large, diverse dataset of long documents with instructions and *accurate segment relevance labels* (especially via synthetic generation) is non-trivial and crucial for training the relevance predictor effectively. Modifying attention mechanisms and integrating the DCW framework into an existing LLM requires substantial engineering effort and computational resources, even with PEFT. While the plan is realistic and uses established techniques, the data dependency and implementation complexity introduce moderate risks, making it challenging but achievable within a well-resourced research setting."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in LLM capabilities â€“ the efficient and effective processing of long text according to specific instructions. Success would lead to major advancements in LLM performance on complex tasks involving extensive documents (legal analysis, scientific review, etc.), improve computational efficiency (reducing cost and energy consumption), and potentially enable entirely new applications. The research also contributes to a deeper understanding of goal-oriented attention mechanisms. The potential contributions are substantial and clearly articulated."
