        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Multimodal and Multidisciplinary' instruction following models, including applications in 'computer vision, robotics'. This proposal directly addresses this by focusing on improving visual-language alignment for instruction following in image editing and robotics using a novel training framework. It also touches upon 'Modeling' (algorithms, objectives) and 'Limitations' (reducing hallucination), which are other listed topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (visual-language misalignment), the core technical proposal (contrastive learning + cross-modal attention), the training methodology (dual-objective loss on paired data), the evaluation plan (benchmarking on specific tasks), and the expected impact. The mechanisms are explained concisely and are immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While contrastive learning for alignment and cross-modal attention are known techniques, their specific integration within an instruction-tuning framework, using a dual-objective loss explicitly designed to enhance visual grounding for following instructions in multimodal contexts (like robotics and image editing), offers a fresh perspective. It's a novel combination and application of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core technical components (contrastive learning, attention mechanisms) are standard in deep learning and implementable with existing frameworks. Paired image-text-instruction datasets are becoming more available, although curating high-quality data for specific domains like robotic manipulation might require significant effort. The computational resources needed are substantial but typical for research on large multimodal models. Standard benchmarks exist for evaluation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Improving the alignment between textual instructions and visual perception is a critical challenge for deploying reliable multimodal AI systems. Success in this area could lead to safer human-robot interaction, more precise creative tools (image editing), and more dependable assistive technologies. Addressing misalignment directly tackles issues like hallucination and improves generalization, which are important limitations of current models."
