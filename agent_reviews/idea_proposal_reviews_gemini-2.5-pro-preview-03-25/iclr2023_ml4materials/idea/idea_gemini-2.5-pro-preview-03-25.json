        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenges highlighted: the need for materials-specific inductive biases (periodicity, symmetry, equivariance) and the development of generative models for materials (specifically inorganic crystals). It fits squarely within the workshop's focus on geometric deep learning, generative models, physical inductive biases, and unique challenges in modeling materials, particularly those in the condensed phase requiring periodic boundary conditions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of current models for crystals), the main technical approach (equivariant diffusion model on fractional coordinates/lattice vectors respecting PBC), how key challenges (equivariance, periodicity, symmetry) will be addressed, the data source (Materials Project), and the goal (conditional generation of stable, novel crystals). The concepts are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models and equivariant networks exist, their specific application and adaptation for *periodic* crystal structure generation, explicitly handling PBC and incorporating equivariance to relevant symmetry groups (beyond standard SE(3) for molecules) within the diffusion framework, represents a novel and advanced approach. It combines existing concepts in a non-trivial way to tackle a specific, challenging problem in materials generation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents technical challenges. Implementing diffusion models is standard, but ensuring true equivariance while respecting periodic boundary conditions within the denoising network requires careful architectural design (e.g., adapting SE(3)-equivariant GNNs for periodicity), which is an active research area. Training these models requires significant computational resources and access to large datasets like the Materials Project (which is feasible). While challenging, it is achievable with current ML techniques and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Discovering novel crystalline materials with desired properties is a critical bottleneck in many technological areas (energy, catalysis). A generative model that accurately captures the physics of crystals (periodicity, symmetry) and allows conditional generation could drastically accelerate materials discovery, enabling exploration of the vast chemical space more effectively than current methods. Success would represent a major advancement in computational materials science."
