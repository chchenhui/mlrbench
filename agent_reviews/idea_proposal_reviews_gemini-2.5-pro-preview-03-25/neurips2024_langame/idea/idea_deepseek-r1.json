        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of 'Language Gamification' by proposing an interactive, multi-agent framework based on language games. It explicitly aims to improve LLM planning and reasoning through interaction, tackling limitations mentioned in the task description (planning deficits, lack of interaction). The proposed methodology using multi-agent RL fits perfectly within the workshop's specified topics, particularly 'Multi-Agent Learning', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning' (leveraging language games for planning/reasoning), and the general goal of enabling interactive LLM finetuning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation is concisely stated, the main idea (multi-agent RL with language games, dual reward structure) is explained precisely, and the expected outcomes (improved planning, generalization, personalization) are clearly articulated. The inclusion of a concrete example (treasure-hunt game) further enhances understanding. While specific implementation details could be elaborated in a full proposal, the core concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using RL and multi-agent systems with LLMs isn't entirely new, the specific framing around Wittgenstein's 'language games' as an explicit mechanism to teach planning and context-sensitive reasoning is innovative. The proposed dual reward structure combining task success with peer-evaluated communication clarity within this interactive game setting offers a fresh perspective compared to standard RLHF or simpler multi-agent reward schemes. The focus on bootstrapping planning abilities through structured linguistic interaction represents a significant conceptual novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents significant practical challenges. Implementing multi-agent RL systems with large language models is computationally intensive. Designing effective language games that reliably foster complex planning skills and defining robust reward functions (especially incorporating peer evaluation) require careful engineering and experimentation. Ensuring stable training and convergence in such complex systems can also be difficult. While achievable in a well-resourced research setting, it's not straightforward and requires overcoming moderate implementation hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it addresses critical limitations of current LLMs, namely their restricted planning capabilities and lack of adaptability stemming from training primarily on static data. Developing methods for interactive learning and grounding language through use could lead to major advancements in AI, enabling more capable, collaborative, and context-aware systems. Success in this research could impact various applications, from sophisticated AI assistants to personalized education tools, representing a potentially transformative shift in LLM training paradigms."
