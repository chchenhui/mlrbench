        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly proposes using a 'language game' between two LLM agents (Planner and Evaluator) trained via Deep Reinforcement Learning (PPO) to enhance planning abilities. This precisely matches the workshop's focus on 'Language Gamification', 'Multi-Agent Learning', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning' for planning/reasoning, and interactive LLM finetuning to address limitations like planning."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It defines the problem (LLM planning deficiency), the proposed solution (PlanCraft framework), the key components (Planner, Evaluator), their interaction mechanism (language game, critique, reward), the training algorithm (PPO), and expected outcomes. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the 'lightweight state tracker or symbolic simulator' and the precise formulation of the reward function, but the core concept is very understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using RL for LLMs, multi-agent systems, and self-play are existing concepts, their specific combination into a Planner-Evaluator language game framework explicitly designed for bootstrapping multi-step planning capabilities via simulated interaction and critique is innovative. It offers a fresh perspective compared to standard supervised finetuning or typical RLHF approaches, framing the interaction explicitly as a 'language game' aligned with the task description."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. Training LLMs with RL (PPO) is computationally intensive but established. Accessing base LLMs is possible. The main challenge lies in developing an effective 'Evaluator' component, including the 'lightweight state tracker/symbolic simulator' and the reward function capturing coherence, efficiency, and safety. Assuming 'lightweight' implies tractability, the overall approach is feasible, albeit requiring significant engineering effort and compute resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Improving multi-step planning and reasoning is a critical bottleneck for current LLMs, limiting their application in complex real-world tasks. Successfully enhancing these capabilities through an interactive, game-based approach like PlanCraft could lead to major advancements in reliable AI assistants, autonomous systems, and task automation. It addresses a core LLM limitation with high potential impact."
