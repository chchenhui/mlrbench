        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Language Gamification' theme by proposing an interactive, multi-agent (Planner vs. Skeptic) training loop using DRL to enhance LLM planning and reasoning, which are noted limitations. The methodology incorporates concepts from DRL, multi-agent learning, and adversarial interaction, all relevant to the workshop topics and cited literature. It explicitly aims to overcome the limitations of static datasets mentioned in the task description and research idea by using dynamic interaction. The problem statement and significance directly echo the motivations provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Key components like the 'Planning via Persuasion' game, agent roles (Planner, Skeptic), interaction protocol, and termination conditions are explicitly defined. The RL framework (PPO, state, action, reward structure) is clearly outlined, and the evaluation plan is specific with defined baselines and metrics. The objectives are unambiguous. While the exact reward function tuning and adaptive Skeptic implementation remain open research questions (as expected), the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using LLMs for planning, DRL, and interactive training are existing research areas (as shown in the literature review), the specific combination within an *adversarial* language game framework ('Planning via Persuasion') where one LLM (Planner) must convince another critical LLM (Skeptic) appears novel. This differs from cooperative multi-agent learning (White & Black, 2023), standard RLHF, or simple self-correction methods. The use of adversarial interaction *as the core training mechanism* to improve planning and justification, rather than just for robustness (Johnson & Brown, 2023), constitutes a fresh perspective aligned with the Language Gamification theme."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established concepts (LLMs, DRL, PPO algorithm) and relevant theoretical ideas (interaction aids learning). The proposed methodology, including the game structure, agent roles, RL formulation (state, action, PPO objective), and particularly the detailed evaluation plan with baselines, metrics, and ablation studies, is robust. The technical formulation of the PPO objective is correct. Potential weaknesses, such as the difficulty of reward engineering and ensuring the Skeptic provides meaningful critiques, are acknowledged implicitly by the complexity of the task but represent inherent research challenges rather than fundamental flaws in the approach. The reliance on a prompted Skeptic initially is a sound starting point."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the core technologies (LLMs, DRL libraries) exist, successfully implementing the interactive DRL loop for LLMs is computationally expensive and notoriously difficult to stabilize. Reward function engineering for complex language tasks is challenging and requires extensive tuning to avoid reward hacking. Ensuring the Skeptic agent provides consistently effective and diverse critiques beyond simple prompting might require substantial effort (e.g., separate fine-tuning or adaptive mechanisms). The planned human evaluation is resource-intensive. While feasible within a well-resourced research environment, the practical hurdles related to training stability, reward design, Skeptic quality, and evaluation complexity lower the feasibility score."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and widely recognized limitations of current LLMs in multi-step planning, reasoning, and justification. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in LLM capabilities, making them more reliable for complex tasks (e.g., assistants, automation, robotics). The proposed interactive, adversarial training method offers a novel contribution to LLM training paradigms (Language Gamification), potentially improving robustness and explainability by forcing models to defend their reasoning. It also offers insights into multi-agent learning dynamics and connects AI research with cognitive science concepts about language and interaction."
