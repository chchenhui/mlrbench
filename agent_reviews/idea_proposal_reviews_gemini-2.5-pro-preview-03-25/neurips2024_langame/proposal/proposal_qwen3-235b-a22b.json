    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Language Gamification' by proposing an interactive LLM finetuning approach inspired by Wittgenstein's language games. The core idea of an adversarial 'Persuasion Game' using DRL to enhance planning aligns perfectly with the research idea provided. Furthermore, the proposal explicitly connects to the task's emphasis on multi-agent learning, RL for planning/reasoning, and overcoming limitations of static training. The methodology and expected outcomes are logically derived from these inputs, and the proposal acknowledges relevant work and challenges identified in the literature review (e.g., interactive training complexity, multi-agent scalability, robustness)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology, expected outcomes, and limitations. The objectives are specific and measurable. The 'Persuasion Game' framework, including the Planner and Skeptic roles, interaction loop, and reward structure, is explained concisely and without ambiguity. The DRL implementation details (PPO, state/action space, advantage estimation) and the experimental design (datasets, baselines, metrics, ablations) are clearly articulated, providing a solid understanding of the proposed research plan. The language used is precise and technical where appropriate, making the proposal immediately understandable to an expert audience."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using RL for LLMs, multi-agent systems, and adversarial training are existing areas (as reflected in the literature review), the specific formulation of the 'Persuasion Game' where a Planner agent learns planning *through* adversarial dialogue aimed at *persuading* a Skeptic agent is innovative. This specific mechanism – linking planning improvement directly to the need to justify steps against adversarial critique within an interactive game – offers a fresh perspective compared to standard RL finetuning (focused solely on task reward) or cooperative multi-agent approaches. The novelty lies in the design of the interaction protocol itself and its targeted application to enhance planning and justification simultaneously."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established concepts (Wittgenstein's language games, RL theory, multi-agent systems). The choice of PPO is appropriate for policy optimization in complex environments. The proposed reward structure logically incentivizes the desired behaviors (task completion, persuasion, efficiency). The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics for evaluation. Technical formulations like the reward equation and RL objective are correctly presented. Minor areas requiring careful implementation include the design of the Skeptic (rule-based vs. learned, ensuring effective critique) and the precise operationalization of 'persuasion success' in the reward, but the overall methodological approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology but presents significant implementation challenges. Training large LLMs with DRL, especially in a multi-agent adversarial setting, is computationally intensive and can be prone to instability. The proposal acknowledges these challenges and suggests appropriate mitigations (PPO, curriculum learning, distributed training, PEFT/LoRA). Access to suitable compute resources is essential. Generating initial supervised data for bootstrapping might require effort. While technically demanding, the plan is generally realistic, building upon existing frameworks (LLMs, DRL libraries, simulation environments like ALFWorld). The risks are manageable with careful engineering and experimentation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and widely recognized limitations of current LLMs – their deficiencies in multi-step planning, reasoning, and justification, often attributed to static training paradigms. By proposing a novel interactive, adversarial training framework, the research has the potential to lead to major advancements in developing more capable, robust, and explainable AI systems. Success could offer a new paradigm for LLM finetuning. The potential applications outlined (education, science, ethics/alignment) underscore the broad importance and potential impact of developing LLMs that can effectively plan and justify their reasoning through interaction."
