    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the limitations of global backpropagation highlighted in the task description (centralization, memory, latency, biological implausibility) and focuses on localized, asynchronous, biologically plausible learning for edge devices â€“ key themes of the workshop. It faithfully elaborates on the core concepts presented in the research idea (EdgePLAS, Hebbian-STDP, knowledge sharing, RL control). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself relative to existing asynchronous FL/decentralized methods (AEDFL, DRACO), bio-inspired learning research, knowledge distillation, and RL for adaptation, while explicitly aiming to tackle the challenges identified (communication, staleness, heterogeneity, etc.)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The objectives are specific and measurable. The system architecture, local learning rules (including equations), knowledge sharing mechanism, and RL-based control are explained in detail. The experimental design is comprehensive and unambiguous. The language used is precise and technical. While the integration of complex components implies underlying complexity, the description itself is highly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. The core novelty lies in the specific combination of biologically plausible local learning rules (hybrid Hebbian-STDP) applied within an asynchronous, decentralized edge computing framework. While individual components (asynchronous learning, bio-inspired rules, knowledge distillation, RL for adaptation) exist in the literature, their integration into the proposed EdgePLAS system, particularly the use of RL to dynamically control plasticity rates for balancing local adaptation and global consistency in this specific context, represents a fresh and distinct approach. It clearly differentiates itself from gradient-based decentralized methods cited in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established concepts from neuroscience, distributed systems, and machine learning. The methodology, including the hybrid learning rule formulation, layer-wise training approach, knowledge sharing mechanism, and RL control loop, is well-reasoned. The experimental design is thorough, featuring relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. However, the theoretical soundness regarding the convergence and stability of the proposed hybrid plasticity learning in a deep, distributed, asynchronous setting is likely limited (acknowledged implicitly by mentioning theoretical guarantees as future work). The practical effectiveness compared to highly optimized gradient-based methods requires strong empirical validation, which the proposal plans for but inherently carries uncertainty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Simulating the heterogeneous edge network and implementing the core algorithms (hybrid plasticity, local losses, asynchronous communication, RL controller) are achievable with current tools and expertise in ML, distributed systems, and RL. However, integrating these complex components into a stable and effective system requires substantial engineering effort. Tuning the numerous hyperparameters associated with plasticity rules, RL, and communication strategies will likely be complex and time-consuming. The main risk lies in whether the bio-inspired rules will achieve competitive performance and stability in practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and timely challenges in deploying AI on edge devices, namely the limitations of traditional backpropagation in terms of communication, latency, robustness, energy, and memory. By proposing a novel, biologically inspired, decentralized learning framework, it has the potential to make substantial contributions to both theory (alternative learning paradigms, computational neuroscience insights) and practice (enabling more scalable, efficient, and resilient edge AI applications in diverse fields like autonomous systems, smart cities, and IoT). The potential impact, if successful, is transformative for the field of edge intelligence."
