    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the limitations of global backpropagation outlined in the task (centralization, memory, latency, biological implausibility) and focuses on relevant topics like asynchronous methods, biologically plausible rules, and edge learning. The methodology closely follows the research idea, proposing the hybrid Hebbian-STDP rule, asynchronous knowledge distillation, and RL-based plasticity adaptation. It effectively incorporates and cites relevant works from the literature review (e.g., AEDFL, DRACO, bio-plausible reviews, KD for edge, RL for plasticity) and positions itself clearly within the existing research landscape, aiming to tackle the identified challenges like communication overhead and staleness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology and evaluation. Key concepts like the hybrid learning rule, knowledge tokens, and the RL framework are introduced. However, some technical details could be more precise. Specifically, the mechanism for obtaining 'firing times' for the STDP component within a standard CNN framework is underspecified â€“ clarification is needed on whether this involves spiking neurons or an approximation. Additionally, the exact nature of the 'weighted averaging' for aggregating knowledge tokens and the specific features comprising the RL state could be elaborated further. While generally understandable, these minor ambiguities prevent a higher score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like Hebbian/STDP learning, asynchronous communication, knowledge distillation, and reinforcement learning exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the novelty lies in their specific synthesis into a coherent framework for edge-localized learning. The combination of biologically plausible local rules (specifically the hybrid Hebbian-STDP) with asynchronous knowledge distillation (as the primary communication method replacing gradients) and dynamic adaptation of plasticity via RL (balancing local vs. global signals based on system state) appears to be a fresh approach in the context of edge AI for streaming video. It clearly distinguishes itself from purely gradient-based asynchronous methods like FedAvg, AEDFL, or DRACO."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established principles (Hebbian/STDP learning, KD, RL, decentralized systems). The methodology appears rigorous, with clear mathematical formulations for the learning rules and a well-defined experimental plan including relevant baselines and metrics. However, two points slightly weaken the soundness: 1) The proposal lacks theoretical analysis regarding the convergence properties of this complex system combining local non-gradient updates, asynchronous communication, and RL adaptation. While empirical validation is planned, the stability and convergence guarantees are not addressed theoretically. 2) The technical soundness of applying STDP, which relies on precise spike timing, within a potentially non-spiking CNN framework requires more justification or clarification on the approximation used."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current ML techniques and simulation environments. Implementing local learning rules, knowledge distillation, and basic RL agents on edge devices (or simulations thereof) is achievable. The experimental plan uses standard datasets and metrics. However, there are moderate feasibility challenges. The system involves integrating multiple complex components (local plasticity, async comms, RL), which can be difficult to implement and debug. Tuning the large number of hyperparameters (plasticity mix, learning rates, RL rewards/parameters, communication frequency, KD settings) is likely to be complex and time-consuming. Ensuring the stability and effective convergence of the interacting parts presents a practical risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and addresses a critical problem in modern AI: enabling efficient, adaptive, and robust learning on resource-constrained edge devices. Overcoming the limitations of traditional centralized/synchronous training is crucial for deploying AI in real-world scenarios like IoT, autonomous systems, and real-time analytics. The potential impact is substantial, promising significant reductions in communication overhead, latency, and energy consumption, along with improved robustness and adaptivity. Furthermore, the work aims to bridge the gap between neuroscience (bio-plausible learning) and practical machine learning, potentially leading to new theoretical insights and hardware designs. The focus on streaming video analytics targets a high-impact application area."
