    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core limitations of global backpropagation highlighted in the task (centralization, memory, latency, biological implausibility) and focuses on relevant topics like asynchronous updates, biologically plausible methods (Hebbian/STDP), and edge-localized learning for streaming video. The methodology clearly builds upon the research idea, incorporating the hybrid Hebbian-STDP rules, RL for plasticity, and knowledge distillation. It appropriately cites and positions itself relative to the provided literature (AEDFL, DRACO, STDP reviews, etc.) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified (communication, staleness, heterogeneity)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, outlining the background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes logically. The core concepts (hybrid local learning, RL adaptation, distillation) are explained. However, some technical details could be more explicit for perfect clarity. For instance, the specific SNN model architecture is not mentioned, the state and action spaces for the RL agent controlling plasticity are undefined, and the exact nature of the compressed latent features 'z' could be elaborated. While the main ideas are understandable, these omissions create minor ambiguities requiring further specification for implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several existing concepts in a novel way to address specific challenges in edge AI. While asynchronous learning (AEDFL, DRACO), bio-plausible rules (STDP/Hebbian), RL for network adaptation, and knowledge distillation exist individually (as shown in the literature review), their integration within a single framework is innovative. Specifically, using a *hybrid* Hebbian-STDP rule for local updates on edge devices, dynamically tuning its parameters (\\eta, \\alpha, \\beta) via *RL* based on edge-specific rewards (staleness, energy), and combining this with *periodic knowledge distillation* for global consistency appears to be a novel approach distinct from standard federated learning or purely bio-inspired models."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, built upon established principles like Hebbian learning, STDP, SNNs, RL (PPO), and knowledge distillation. The mathematical formulations for the hybrid rule, RL objective, and distillation loss are presented and appear formally correct. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and comprehensive metrics. However, some aspects lack full justification or detail, slightly weakening the rigor. The effectiveness of the specific hybrid Hebbian-STDP formulation needs empirical validation. The stability and convergence properties of the RL control loop for plasticity parameters are assumed but not theoretically analyzed. The choice of SNNs introduces complexity, and details about the specific model and its training stability are missing. While the overall approach is plausible, its soundness relies on empirical success and further specification."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Implementing and efficiently training SNNs with custom hybrid local learning rules on resource-constrained edge devices (Jetson Nano) is non-trivial. Designing and training the RL agent for dynamic plasticity control adds another layer of complexity, requiring careful state/action design and reward engineering. Integrating these components (local SNN learning, RL control, server distillation) into a robust, stable, and performant system requires considerable effort and expertise. Achieving the ambitious targets (sub-60ms latency, 40% communication reduction, high robustness) is uncertain. While feasible as a research project, there are substantial risks and technical hurdles to overcome."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses highly significant challenges in deploying AI on edge devices, particularly the limitations of traditional backpropagation in terms of communication overhead, latency, resource constraints, and synchronization dependency. By exploring asynchronous, localized, and biologically inspired learning, it tackles a critical problem in enabling scalable and adaptive AI for real-world applications like autonomous systems, IoT, and real-time analytics. Success would represent a major advancement in edge AI, potentially leading to more efficient, robust, and energy-aware systems. The work also contributes to the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and distributed systems, aligning with important trends like neuromorphic computing and Green AI."
