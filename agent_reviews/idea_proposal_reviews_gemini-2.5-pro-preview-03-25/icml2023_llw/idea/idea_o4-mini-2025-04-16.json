        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the limitations of global backpropagation (latency, memory, edge constraints) highlighted in the workshop call. It explicitly proposes using Forward-Forward learning and focuses on localized learning on edge devices, both listed as key topics. Furthermore, it incorporates asynchronous updates and targets a new application (streaming video analytics), fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core mechanism (sliding window FF, positive/negative sample generation, independent layer learning, asynchronous updates), target platform (edge GPU), and evaluation metrics are clearly stated. Expected outcomes are quantified. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact nature of 'goodness summaries' passed between layers and the precise trigger mechanism for asynchronous updates, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While Forward-Forward is an existing concept, its application within a sliding-window framework specifically for streaming video analytics on edge devices is novel. The proposed method for generating positive/negative samples based on motion coherence and the asynchronous, threshold-based local updates for adaptation represent innovative extensions tailored to the problem domain. It's a fresh combination and application of recent ideas."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Forward-Forward has been implemented, and edge GPUs are available. The sliding window approach and proposed sample generation seem computationally viable. Standard metrics are used for evaluation. However, implementing and tuning the Forward-Forward process, especially the asynchronous updates and ensuring stability across layers without global coordination, might present moderate challenges. Achieving the ambitious performance targets (<10ms updates, 50% memory savings) requires careful engineering and validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant with clear impact potential. Enabling real-time, adaptive, low-latency, and memory-efficient learning directly on edge devices for video streams addresses a critical bottleneck in edge AI. Success could lead to advancements in autonomous systems, mobile AR, and smart surveillance, offering a practical alternative to backprop for continual learning in resource-constrained environments. It tackles important issues related to efficiency and adaptability in AI."
