    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core need for 'Explainable MFMs' and 'Robust Diagnosis' highlighted in the task description. The methodology thoroughly expands on the 'Causal-MFM' concept presented in the research idea, detailing causal discovery, the explanation module, and evaluation. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, referencing specific works (e.g., Cheng et al., Zhang et al., Shetty & Jordan) and explicitly addressing key challenges identified in the review (data quality, causal complexity, validation). The focus on causality as a means to achieve transparency and robustness is perfectly consistent with the workshop's goals. A minor point is the lack of explicit focus on 'Security/Privacy', another workshop topic, but this doesn't detract significantly as the proposal concentrates deeply on explainability and robustness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The background, motivation, and significance are articulated precisely. The research objectives are distinct and measurable. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step plan, outlining the Causal-MFM framework, data handling, specific algorithms considered for causal discovery (PC, GES, NOTEARS), integration strategies (regularization, attention, GNNs), the design of the causal explanation module (path identification, counterfactuals), and a comprehensive evaluation strategy with clear metrics (performance, faithfulness, plausibility, robustness) and baselines. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While causal inference, foundation models, and explainability are individually active research areas, the proposed integration of causal discovery and causal explanation generation (specifically counterfactuals derived from learned graphs) directly within a large-scale, multimodal Medical Foundation Model (MFM) framework represents a novel synthesis. It moves beyond standard post-hoc, correlation-based XAI methods often applied to FMs. The proposal builds upon recent works like CInA and CausaLM but aims for a more comprehensive, end-to-end framework tailored to multimodal medical data, explicitly linking causal discovery to explanation generation within the MFM context. The emphasis on using causality to improve both interpretability *and* robustness in MFMs is a key innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and methodologically rigorous. It is well-grounded in established causal inference theory (Pearl's SCMs, do-calculus) and leverages recent advancements in causal discovery and causally-informed machine learning. The proposed methods for causal discovery, MFM fine-tuning (PEFT), explanation generation (counterfactuals), and evaluation (including human assessment and OOD testing) are appropriate and well-justified. The plan to incorporate domain knowledge and consider latent confounders adds to the rigor. The primary challenge, acknowledged in the proposal, is the inherent difficulty and assumption-laden nature of causal discovery from observational, high-dimensional, multimodal data. However, the proposed approaches represent the state-of-the-art, and the evaluation plan is designed to assess the quality of the learned causal structures and explanations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Using public datasets (MIMIC, CheXpert) and PEFT techniques enhances feasibility. However, reliably performing causal discovery on complex, noisy, multimodal medical data is inherently difficult and requires substantial expertise and potentially novel algorithmic development. Integrating the discovered causal structures effectively into the MFM architecture (via regularization, attention, or GNNs) is also non-trivial. Furthermore, conducting rigorous clinical validation through clinician feedback requires careful planning and collaboration. While ambitious, the plan is well-structured and acknowledges these challenges, suggesting mitigation strategies (domain constraints, starting with sub-problems). Success hinges on overcoming the technical hurdles in causal discovery and integration."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in medical AI: the lack of trust and interpretability in complex models like MFMs, which is a major barrier to clinical adoption and regulatory approval. By aiming to ground explanations in causal reasoning rather than just correlation, the research has the potential to significantly enhance the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of MFMs. Success could lead to safer AI deployment in healthcare, improved clinician trust, better human-AI collaboration, potential for new insights into disease mechanisms, and alignment with regulatory demands for transparent AI. The potential impact on clinical practice and the advancement of explainable AI methodology is substantial."
