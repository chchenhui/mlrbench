        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key workshop themes like Explainable MFMs, Robust Diagnosis, Multimodal Learning, Human-AI Interaction, and Fairness. The methodology clearly follows the research idea, elaborating on causal discovery, explanation modules, and validation. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review (data quality, complexity, interpretability-performance trade-off, clinical adoption), positioning itself effectively within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and logically presented. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of data sources, preprocessing steps, the algorithmic framework (including specific techniques like PC algorithm, VAEs, causal attention, CBNs), and a comprehensive experimental design. Technical concepts and equations are included to define key components. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly stated, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the project's goals and plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing causal inference techniques with multimodal Medical Foundation Models (MFMs). While building upon existing work in causal discovery (Lit 1, 5), causal attention (Lit 2), and causal explainability in medicine (Lit 3, 4, 6-10), it proposes a novel integrated framework (Causal-MFM). Specific contributions include the proposed 'Causal Attention' mechanism tailored for MFMs, the focus on multimodal data integration (imaging, EHR, sensors) for causal discovery, and the emphasis on generating action-aware counterfactual explanations directly within the MFM architecture. It represents a significant step beyond standard correlation-based explainability for MFMs."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, rooted in established principles of causal inference (SCMs, CBNs, do-calculus) and deep learning (transformers, VAEs). The methodology employs recognized techniques (PC algorithm, MICE, contrastive learning) and includes appropriate evaluation metrics and baselines. However, the inherent difficulty of causal discovery from complex, observational medical data (potential for unobserved confounders, identifiability issues) poses a challenge that isn't fully elaborated upon. Additionally, the precise mechanism and theoretical guarantees for the proposed 'Causal Attention' require further specification and justification. The integration of CBNs into large transformers also presents non-trivial technical challenges."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. Using existing public datasets (MIMIC, BraTS, eICU) enhances feasibility. The proposed methods (PC algorithm, VAEs, transformer modifications) are computationally intensive but implementable with adequate resources. The main challenges lie in the complex integration of causal discovery, causal attention, and CBNs into a large MFM architecture, requiring significant expertise and engineering effort. Robust causal discovery from noisy, multimodal data is inherently difficult. Securing domain expert annotations and clinician feedback (20+ clinicians) requires coordination but is achievable. The project carries technical risks related to the performance and faithfulness of the causal components."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of trust and interpretability in MFMs, which is a major barrier to their clinical adoption, especially in high-stakes scenarios. By aiming to provide causal explanations, the research has the potential for substantial impact on improving clinician trust, enhancing model robustness against covariate shifts, promoting fairness by identifying causal biases, and aligning AI systems with regulatory requirements (e.g., EU AI Act). Success would represent a major advancement towards trustworthy and human-aligned medical AI, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the task description."
