        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for advancements in Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) with a strong emphasis on security and patient privacy. It lists 'Patient Privacy' as a key topic, specifically mentioning 'federated learning' as an area of interest. The proposed idea directly addresses this by focusing on a federated learning framework tailored for MFMs to ensure patient privacy, aligning perfectly with the workshop's scope and stated topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem of privacy in MFM training. The main idea is well-defined, specifying the core techniques (hierarchical federated learning, differential privacy) and the specific challenges to be addressed (non-IID data). The objectives are unambiguous: enabling collaborative MFM development while preserving privacy. The proposal is concise and easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While federated learning and differential privacy are established concepts, their application to large-scale Medical Foundation Models presents unique challenges. The novelty lies in proposing a *hierarchical* FL architecture specifically for MFMs and developing *domain-specific federated optimization algorithms* tailored to the non-IID nature of distributed medical data across institutions. It's not proposing entirely new primitives but offers an innovative application and refinement of existing techniques for a critical and complex domain."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant practical challenges. The core technologies (FL frameworks, DP libraries) exist. However, implementing FL across multiple healthcare institutions involves substantial logistical hurdles (agreements, standardization, infrastructure). Training large foundation models via FL is computationally demanding, requiring significant resources at each participating site and for aggregation. Effectively applying DP without overly degrading MFM utility, especially for complex medical tasks, remains a challenge. Handling non-IID data robustly in FL is an active research area. Therefore, while technically conceivable as a research project, large-scale practical implementation is challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Patient privacy is arguably one of the biggest obstacles to leveraging diverse, large-scale datasets for training powerful MFMs. Developing effective privacy-preserving techniques like the proposed FL framework could unlock access to distributed data silos, enabling the creation of more robust, generalizable, and equitable MFMs. This directly addresses a critical bottleneck in the field and could lead to major advancements in AI-driven healthcare, aligning with the workshop's goal of improving patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows."
