    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed in the workshop call, specifically 'Explainable MFMs', 'Robust Diagnosis' (including parameter-efficient tuning, validation, and data scarcity), and 'MFMs with Resource Constraint'. The focus on rural healthcare aligns perfectly with the workshop's motivation regarding healthcare disparities and the need for AI in underserved regions. While it doesn't explicitly cover every listed topic like 'Patient Privacy' or 'Security', its core focus strongly matches the central themes of the workshop."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-defined, outlining the problem of healthcare access in rural areas. The main idea is broken down into four logical and understandable steps (Explainability Enhancement, Robustness Improvement, Resource Optimization, Clinical Validation), each with specific methods or goals mentioned (e.g., LIME/SHAP, transfer learning, lightweight models, collaboration). The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly articulated, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates satisfactory novelty. While the individual techniques proposed (LIME, SHAP, transfer learning, data augmentation, model optimization) are established methods in machine learning and explainability, the novelty lies in their specific combination and application to enhance MFMs tailored for the unique challenges of rural healthcare settings (resource constraints, data scarcity, diverse scenarios). It's more about applying and integrating existing tools in a focused, impactful way rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms or architectures. The emphasis on clinical validation in this specific context adds practical novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. The technical components, such as implementing LIME/SHAP, using transfer learning, data augmentation, and developing lightweight models, rely on existing and well-understood techniques. The primary challenges, common in medical AI research, would be securing diverse and representative medical data from rural settings and establishing effective collaborations with healthcare professionals for clinical validation. However, these are practical hurdles rather than fundamental impossibilities, making the overall plan highly achievable with appropriate resources and partnerships."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds excellent significance and potential impact. Addressing healthcare disparities in rural and underserved regions is a critical global challenge. Enhancing the explainability and robustness of MFMs is crucial for building trust and ensuring safe deployment in clinical practice. Furthermore, optimizing these models for resource-constrained environments directly tackles the accessibility barrier. Successful execution could lead to major advancements in AI-driven healthcare for vulnerable populations, improving diagnostics, patient outcomes, and workflow efficiency where it's most needed."
