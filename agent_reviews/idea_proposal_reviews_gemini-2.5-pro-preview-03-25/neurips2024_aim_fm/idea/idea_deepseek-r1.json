    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed in the workshop call, including 'Robust Diagnosis' (specifically mentioning scarcity/misalignment of medical data and parameter-efficient tuning), 'MFMs with Resource Constraint' (focusing on limited data), 'Multimodal Learning' (handling heterogeneous data, modality misalignment/missing), and 'Efficient MFMs' (via few-shot learning and data efficiency). The focus on improving diagnostics in low-resource settings strongly resonates with the workshop's goal of leveraging MFMs to address healthcare disparities and enhance robustness."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the motivation (data scarcity/misalignment in low-resource settings), the proposed solution (combining few-shot learning, self-supervised multimodal alignment, PEFT, uncertainty quantification), the methodology (cross-modal pretraining, adaptation), and the expected outcomes (validated MFM, >85% accuracy, democratization). The specific mention of techniques like low-rank adapters adds precision. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like few-shot learning, self-supervised learning, multimodal models, PEFT, and uncertainty quantification exist, their specific combination and application to create robust MFMs tailored for *low-resource, multimodal diagnostic settings* is innovative. The novelty lies in the synergistic integration of these techniques to address the specific challenges of data scarcity, heterogeneity, and misalignment in underserved medical environments, rather than introducing a fundamentally new algorithm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It leverages established ML techniques (few-shot learning, self-supervised pretraining, PEFT like LoRA, uncertainty methods). Public datasets can be used for pretraining, and low-resource scenarios can be simulated for benchmarking. Parameter-efficient tuning makes adaptation computationally less demanding than full fine-tuning. Potential challenges include accessing truly representative real-world low-resource data for final validation and the significant computational cost for initial pretraining, but these are common hurdles in MFM research and seem surmountable within a well-resourced research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It targets a critical global health issue: the lack of access to reliable diagnostics in resource-constrained areas. Successfully developing robust MFMs for such settings could significantly improve healthcare equity and patient outcomes. Addressing data scarcity and model robustness are major challenges in deploying medical AI, and the focus on uncertainty quantification enhances trustworthiness, which is crucial for clinical adoption. The potential impact on democratizing AI healthcare is substantial."
