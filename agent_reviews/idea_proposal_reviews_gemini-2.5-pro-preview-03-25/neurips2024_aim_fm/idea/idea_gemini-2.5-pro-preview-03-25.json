        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses one of the primary topics listed in the task description: 'Explainable MFMs'. It aims to 'Open the black box of MFMs in medical decision-making, ensuring transparency and interpretability', which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal. The motivation explicitly mentions the need for explainability to enhance clinical trust, directly echoing the task's emphasis on reliability and trustworthiness. The proposed method targets MFMs fine-tuned for specific medical tasks, fitting squarely within the scope of 'Advancements In Medical Foundation Models'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly. The motivation, the core mechanism (Concept Bottleneck layer injection during fine-tuning), the nature of the concepts (high-level, clinical), the supervision source (annotations/expert labels), and the intended benefits (intrinsic explainability, verification, potential robustness) are all well-articulated and easy to understand. The concept of forcing prediction through intermediate, interpretable concepts is clearly defined. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact mechanism for deriving concept labels or the specific architecture modifications, but the overall research direction is crystal clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are an established technique for interpretability. However, the novelty lies in specifically proposing their *injection* into large-scale *Medical Foundation Models* during the *fine-tuning* stage for medical tasks. While not inventing a fundamentally new mechanism, applying and adapting CBMs to the MFM paradigm, particularly in the context of fine-tuning for diverse medical applications (like chest X-ray classification), offers a novel approach to tackling explainability challenges specific to these powerful but opaque models in the critical domain of healthcare. It's a relevant and innovative application of existing ideas to a new and important context."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The core idea is technically feasible. CBMs have been implemented previously, and fine-tuning foundation models is standard practice. The main implementation challenge lies in acquiring or generating high-quality labels for the intermediate clinical concepts. This might require significant effort in processing medical reports (e.g., using NLP) or obtaining annotations from domain experts, which can be resource-intensive. However, assuming access to relevant medical data and potentially expert input (common in medical AI research), the implementation using standard deep learning frameworks is practical. The computational cost would depend on the MFM size and the complexity of the concept layer but is within the realm of current research capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a highly significant problem in medical AI: the lack of transparency and interpretability in complex models like MFMs. Explainability is crucial for clinical adoption, debugging, bias detection, and building trust between clinicians and AI systems. By providing intrinsic explanations based on clinically relevant concepts, this approach could directly facilitate verification of the model's reasoning process by doctors. If successful, it could lead to more trustworthy and reliable MFMs, potentially accelerating their safe integration into clinical workflows and addressing a critical barrier highlighted in the task description."
