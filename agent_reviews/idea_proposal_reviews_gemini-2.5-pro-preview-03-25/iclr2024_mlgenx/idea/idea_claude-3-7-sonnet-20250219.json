        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key subject areas listed, including 'Foundation models for genomics', 'Biological sequence design', 'Uncertainty quantification', 'Generative models in Biology', 'Pre-training', and 'Fine-tuning'. Furthermore, it focuses explicitly on 'emerging drug modalities such as gene and cell therapies and RNA-based drugs', which is a central theme of the workshop task. The proposal aims to introduce new ML methods (uncertainty-aware foundation models) to address limitations in existing genomic sequence design, fitting the workshop's objective perfectly."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (lack of uncertainty quantification in sequence design). The main idea concisely describes the proposed solution (uncertainty-aware foundation models using probabilistic methods), the architecture (pre-training/fine-tuning), and the validation strategy (wet-lab experiments, calibration framework). The goal (reliable therapeutic sequence design) is explicit and understandable. Minor details about the specific Bayesian or diffusion techniques or the calibration framework could be elaborated, but the core concept is communicated with excellent clarity and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While foundation models, Bayesian deep learning, diffusion models, and uncertainty quantification exist individually, their integration into a unified framework specifically for *uncertainty-aware genomic sequence design* is innovative. Current sequence design often focuses on deterministic optimization. Proposing a foundation model that generates diverse candidates *with calibrated confidence scores*, validated via wet-lab experiments and a specific calibration framework, represents a fresh perspective. It combines existing concepts in a novel way to address a specific gap in the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant resource requirements. Training foundation models requires substantial computational power and large genomic datasets, which are increasingly available but still demanding. Implementing Bayesian deep learning or diffusion models adds computational complexity. The most challenging aspect is the proposed wet-lab validation, which is essential for demonstrating real-world utility but is inherently expensive, time-consuming, and requires specialized infrastructure and expertise. While technically plausible, the practical implementation, especially the validation loop, requires considerable resources and effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the development of gene/cell therapies and RNA-based drugs: the unreliability of computationally designed sequences due to unquantified uncertainty. Improving the predictability and reliability of sequence design, and providing confidence estimates, could drastically reduce failure rates in preclinical and clinical stages, saving costs and accelerating the delivery of new therapies. Success in this area would represent a major advancement in computational biology and therapeutic design, directly contributing to the workshop's goal of accelerating innovation in drug discovery."
