    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core goal of the CRL workshop: learning low-dimensional causal variables from raw data without supervision to improve robustness, generalization, and support for reasoning/planning. The methodology precisely implements the research idea (VAE, latent intervention, flow decoder, contrastive loss). It explicitly identifies and aims to fill gaps noted in the literature review, such as the reliance on supervision or curated interventional data in prior works. The focus on unsupervised learning from images, simulated interventions, and evaluation on disentanglement, OOD robustness, and planning fits perfectly within the scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a clear overview of the architecture, mathematically precise definitions of the loss components (ELBO, Flow, Contrastive), and a step-by-step training procedure. The experimental design is detailed, specifying datasets, metrics, baselines, and hyperparameters. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the proposed approach and evaluation plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like VAEs, normalizing flows, contrastive learning, and the concept of interventions exist, their specific combination for unsupervised CRL is innovative. Key novel aspects include: (1) the use of *on-the-fly simulated latent interventions* by sampling from the prior, (2) employing a *conditional normalizing flow decoder* to generate high-fidelity counterfactuals from these interventions, and (3) the specific *contrastive objective* designed to isolate the effect of the intervention on individual latent dimensions. This combination distinguishes it from prior work, which often relies on supervision, known graphs, real interventional data, or focuses on different data modalities/tasks."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, building upon well-established techniques (VAEs, NFs, Contrastive Learning). The mathematical formulations for the loss functions are correct and clearly presented. The overall framework is logically coherent. However, the core assumption that replacing a latent coordinate z_k with a sample z'_k \\\\sim p(z_k) effectively simulates a 'causal' intervention that can lead to the discovery of true causal factors needs stronger theoretical justification or relies heavily on empirical validation. While plausible, it's an approximation whose validity might depend on the data and model specifics. The rest of the methodology (VAE structure, flow properties, contrastive learning principles) is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It leverages standard deep learning components (Convolutional VAEs, RealNVP flows, projection heads for contrastive loss) for which established libraries (PyTorch mentioned) and implementations exist. The proposed datasets (dSprites, CLEVR, MNIST variants, CARLA) are standard and accessible. The evaluation metrics are common in disentanglement and OOD literature. The computational requirements seem manageable with standard GPU resources, given the proposed model scale and training regime. There are no obvious technical roadblocks, making successful execution highly likely."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: learning representations that capture underlying causal structure to improve robustness, generalization, and interpretability, especially in an unsupervised manner. Success would represent a major advancement over correlation-based methods. The potential impact is substantial, particularly for safety-critical applications like robotics, autonomous driving, and medical imaging, as mentioned. Achieving the expected outcomes (improved disentanglement, OOD robustness, planning performance) would provide a valuable tool and benchmark for the CRL community."
