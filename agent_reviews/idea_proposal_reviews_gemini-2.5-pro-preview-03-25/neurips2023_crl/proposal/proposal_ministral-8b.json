        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the Causal Representation Learning (CRL) workshop by aiming to learn causal variables from raw data using counterfactuals, moving beyond simple correlations. The methodology precisely follows the research idea (VAE, latent intervention, contrastive loss). It acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as identifiability and generalization/robustness. The focus on unsupervised discovery of causal factors fits perfectly within the scope of CRL as described."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology (VAE, counterfactual generation, contrastive loss), and expected outcomes are understandable. The algorithm steps and the contrastive loss formula are provided. However, some technical details lack precision: the exact mechanism of the 'learnable latent intervention module' is underspecified (is it learned or just a random perturbation strategy?), the specific conditioning in the normalizing flow decoder could be clearer, and the exact nature of the representations used in the contrastive loss ('z' vs. projected features) could be explicitly stated. While generally logical, these minor ambiguities slightly detract from perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While VAEs, latent interventions, counterfactual reasoning, and contrastive learning are individually established concepts (as reflected in the literature review), their specific combination here appears novel. The core idea of generating counterfactual images via latent perturbations decoded by a conditional flow, and then using a contrastive loss keyed to the intervention axis to enforce independence (interpreted as causal disentanglement) in an unsupervised manner, offers a fresh approach within CRL. It distinguishes itself from supervised methods and standard disentanglement techniques by explicitly leveraging counterfactual generation and contrastive learning in this specific way."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, built upon established techniques like VAEs, normalizing flows, and contrastive learning. The rationale of using interventions/counterfactuals to probe causal structure is valid. However, the soundness of the core causal claim relies heavily on the assumption that perturbing latent dimensions corresponds to meaningful 'atomic interventions' on underlying causal factors, and that the proposed contrastive objective successfully isolates these *causal* factors (rather than just statistically independent factors of variation). This link requires stronger theoretical justification or empirical validation beyond what is presented. The mathematical formulation for the loss is standard, but the overall causal grounding could be more rigorous. The identifiability challenges mentioned in the literature review are relevant here."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Implementing VAEs, normalizing flows, and contrastive losses is standard in modern deep learning frameworks. The proposed datasets (dSprites, CLEVR, domain-shift benchmarks) are commonly used and accessible. The evaluation metrics (disentanglement scores, classification accuracy, domain generalization) are well-established. Training such models requires significant computation but is generally achievable with standard GPU resources. The primary risks are related to the *effectiveness* of the method (i.e., whether it achieves the desired causal disentanglement - a soundness concern) rather than fundamental implementation hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: moving beyond correlations to learn robust, generalizable, and interpretable causal representations from raw data. This aligns directly with the goals of the CRL field and the workshop. If successful, developing an unsupervised method that leverages counterfactuals to discover causal factors could lead to meaningful advancements in AI reliability, robustness to domain shifts, and potential for higher-level reasoning. The potential impact on areas requiring trustworthy AI (e.g., robotics, healthcare) is substantial."
