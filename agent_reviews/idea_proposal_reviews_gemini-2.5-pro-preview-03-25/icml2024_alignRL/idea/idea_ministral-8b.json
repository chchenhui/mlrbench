        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses the core problem highlighted in the task description â€“ the gap between RL theory and practice. It aims to foster collaboration and integrate theoretical insights with empirical findings, which aligns with the spirit of the task. However, the task description focuses on organizing a *workshop* to facilitate communication and identify new problems, whereas the research idea proposes a specific *framework* or methodology for conducting research. While the framework could be a topic *discussed* at such a workshop or a potential outcome, it doesn't directly propose activities for the workshop itself. Therefore, it's only somewhat aligned, addressing the underlying problem but proposing a different type of solution than the task explicitly describes (a research framework vs. a workshop plan)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea presents a clear motivation and outlines a three-component framework (Theoretical, Practical, Hybrid). The high-level goal and the roles of the first two components are relatively understandable. However, the description lacks detail, particularly regarding the 'Hybrid Model'. How theoretical insights and practical data are specifically combined, the mechanisms for feedback loops between the models, and the operational details of the framework remain ambiguous. It's more of a conceptual outline than a well-defined research plan, leaving key aspects open to interpretation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The challenge of bridging the theory-practice gap in RL is well-known, and efforts to combine theoretical analysis with empirical validation are common. The novelty here lies primarily in formalizing this process into a distinct 'Multi-Model Framework' with named components (Theoretical, Practical, Hybrid). While structuring the approach this way might offer a new perspective or organizational principle, the underlying concept of iterating between theory, experimentation, and refinement is fundamental to scientific progress and not entirely new. It doesn't introduce a groundbreaking technique but rather proposes a specific structure for addressing a known problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Implementing the 'Theoretical Model' (algorithm development/analysis) and 'Practical Model' (empirical testing) individually is standard practice and thus feasible. The main feasibility challenge lies in operationalizing the 'Hybrid Model' and effectively integrating the outputs of the other two. Defining the mechanisms for combining theoretical guarantees with messy real-world data, establishing effective communication and collaboration protocols between potentially disparate teams (theorists and experimentalists), and securing resources for diverse real-world testing environments pose significant practical hurdles. The success hinges on overcoming the very collaboration gap it aims to solve."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant problem in the RL community. The gap between theoretical possibilities and practical applicability hinders the deployment of RL in complex, real-world scenarios. Successfully bridging this gap, as the proposed framework aims to do, could lead to the development of more robust, reliable, and widely applicable RL algorithms. This would accelerate the translation of research into practice and potentially unlock breakthroughs in various domains. The potential impact on the field is substantial."
