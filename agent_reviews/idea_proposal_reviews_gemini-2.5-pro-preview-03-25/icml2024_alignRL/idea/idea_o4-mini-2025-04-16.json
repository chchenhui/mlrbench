        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly targets the core problem identified in the task: the gap between RL theory and practice. The proposed framework, involving structural complexity profiling and feedback loops for algorithm selection and theoretical prioritization, explicitly aims to bridge this gap by creating a common language and mechanism for interaction, directly addressing the workshop's desiderata of communicating results and identifying relevant problem structures/classes."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation is explicitly stated, and the main components (toolkit, complexity metrics, clustering, complexity signatures, feedback loops for algorithm selection and theory guidance, validation plan) are clearly articulated. The purpose and proposed mechanism are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While analyzing structural properties of RL problems isn't entirely new in theory, the proposal to create a systematic, empirical profiling toolkit measuring a specific combination of key theoretical metrics (Bellman rank, exploration dimension, etc.) across diverse environments to generate 'complexity signatures' is innovative. Furthermore, the explicit design of feedback loops connecting these empirical profiles to both practical algorithm selection (based on theoretical guarantees) and guiding theoretical research priorities represents a fresh and integrated approach to bridging the theory-practice divide."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. Developing the open-source toolkit and integrating it with various environments requires significant engineering effort. Empirically estimating certain theoretical metrics like Bellman rank or exploration dimension accurately and efficiently for complex environments could be difficult and may require sophisticated approximation techniques. However, measuring sparsity or smoothness is more straightforward, and the overall framework relies on existing concepts and computational methods (clustering, database management). The validation plan is standard. It's ambitious but achievable with dedicated resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and persistent problem in the RL community â€“ the disconnect between theoretical advancements and practical applications. If successful, the proposed framework could provide a standardized methodology and common language, fostering better communication and collaboration. It has the potential to lead to more principled algorithm selection in practice and guide theoretical research towards areas with higher practical relevance, thereby accelerating progress in the field significantly."
