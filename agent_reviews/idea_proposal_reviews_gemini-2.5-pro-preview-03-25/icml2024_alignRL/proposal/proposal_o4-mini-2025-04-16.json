        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core goal of bridging the gap between RL theory and practice, as emphasized in the task description. The methodology of reverse-engineering empirical heuristics through formalization, theoretical analysis, hybrid algorithm design, and experimental validation perfectly matches the research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the lack of theoretical justification for heuristics, sample efficiency, bias introduction, and generalization, while building upon recent related work cited."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The four-stage methodology is broken down effectively, and each stage is described with sufficient detail, including mathematical formalizations (MDPs, reward shaping, exploration bonuses) and specific algorithmic concepts (RSL, HA-UCRL, PFQI). The significance and potential impact are clearly stated. While detailed proofs or hyperparameter specifics are omitted (as expected in a proposal), the core concepts and research plan are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the general problem of bridging RL theory and practice and analyzing heuristics is recognized (as evidenced by the literature review, particularly recent papers), this proposal offers a novel, systematic, and comprehensive approach. It uniquely proposes to: 1) Formalize a *broad class* of heuristics (shaping, exploration, LLM/planning) within a unified framework. 2) Derive *specific theoretical results* (like Thm 2.1 quantifying non-potential shaping bias, Thm 2.2 for heuristic bonus regret, and sample complexity bounds incorporating priors) that appear to be new contributions. 3) Design *concrete hybrid algorithms* (RSL, HA-UCRL, PFQI) integrating theoretical insights. This multi-faceted approach distinguishes it from prior work focusing on narrower aspects."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in the standard MDP framework and leverages established theoretical concepts (potential functions, UCB-style optimism, fitted Q-iteration). The proposed methodology follows a logical progression from formalization to theory and empirical validation. The mathematical formulations presented are standard and clear. The theorems stated (though without proof) represent plausible and interesting theoretical directions, extending existing analysis techniques to heuristic settings. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant benchmarks, baselines, metrics, and validation protocols, ensuring empirical rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The research relies on well-established RL concepts, algorithms (DQN, PPO, FQI), benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo), and theoretical tools. Implementing the proposed hybrid algorithms appears achievable by modifying existing frameworks. Running the described experiments requires significant computational resources and engineering effort, but this is standard in contemporary RL research. The main challenge lies in the theoretical analysis, as deriving tight and meaningful bounds can be difficult, especially beyond tabular settings. However, the proposed theoretical goals seem like reasonable research targets, making the overall plan realistic with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged bottleneck in RL: the gap between empirical success driven by heuristics and the lack of theoretical understanding and guarantees. Successfully bridging this gap, as proposed, would lead to more reliable, robust, and generalizable RL algorithms. Understanding *why* heuristics work can enhance trust, guide practitioners, and potentially unlock new algorithmic improvements. The expected outcomes, including theoretical frameworks, validated hybrid algorithms, and open-source contributions, have the potential for substantial impact on both the theoretical and applied RL communities."
