    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task description – bridging the gap between RL theory and practice – by focusing on understanding empirically successful heuristics. It faithfully elaborates on the research idea of 'reverse-engineering' these heuristics. Furthermore, it effectively situates the research within the context provided by the literature review, acknowledging the existing gap, citing relevant recent work (even if some citations appear illustrative), and positioning itself as a systematic approach to a recognized problem. The proposal explicitly connects its significance to the workshop's desiderata, showing a clear understanding of the context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly through the phased methodology). The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step plan (Phase 1-4) that is logical and easy to follow. Key concepts like 'formalizing implicit assumptions' are explained with concrete examples (reward shaping, exploration bonus, PER). The motivation, significance, and expected outcomes are articulated precisely and persuasively. The structure is logical, and the language used is unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty. While the general idea of theoretically analyzing RL heuristics is not entirely new (as evidenced by the recent literature cited, including potentially hypothetical examples indicating current trends), the proposal's emphasis on a *systematic*, *multi-heuristic*, *reverse-engineering* approach is innovative. It aims to go beyond analyzing individual heuristics by seeking to formalize their *implicit* assumptions, link them explicitly to *problem structures*, and use this understanding to design *principled alternatives* and *hybrid algorithms*. This comprehensive methodology and scope offer a fresh perspective compared to isolated analyses or simpler integration frameworks mentioned in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in established RL theoretical concepts (MDPs, Bellman equations, regret, sample complexity). The proposed methodology, involving formalization, theoretical analysis (bounding complexity/regret, bias-variance analysis), principled component design, and empirical validation, is scientifically rigorous. The technical formulations mentioned (e.g., Q-learning update with bonus) are appropriate. The core approach of identifying implicit assumptions and analyzing heuristics under those assumptions is theoretically well-founded. The inherent difficulty of theoretical analysis, especially with function approximation, is a known challenge in the field but does not detract from the soundness of the proposed approach itself."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant challenges, making it ambitious. The theoretical analysis phase, particularly deriving meaningful guarantees for complex heuristics combined with function approximation, is inherently difficult and may require simplifying assumptions or focusing on specific cases. Formalizing certain heuristics mathematically might also prove challenging. The empirical validation phase requires substantial computational resources and careful implementation. However, the phased methodology is practical, allowing for incremental progress. The problem is well-defined, and the required expertise (RL theory and practice) is identifiable. With adequate resources and skilled researchers, the project is feasible, although the theoretical depth achievable might vary."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged problem in RL – the disconnect between theory and practice and the opacity of commonly used heuristics. Successfully understanding these heuristics and developing principled alternatives could lead to major advancements: more robust, reliable, and generalizable RL algorithms; better guidance for practitioners; and new directions for theoretical research focused on practically relevant problems. The potential impact on algorithm design, trustworthiness, and the synergy between RL sub-communities (as targeted by the workshop) is substantial."
