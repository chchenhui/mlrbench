    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of leveraging physics structures (specifically, symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics) to create novel ML methods. It elaborates comprehensively on the initial research idea of 'Symplectic Neural Networks'. Furthermore, it effectively situates the proposed work within the context of the provided literature review, acknowledging prior art (HNNs, NSSNNs, flow-based methods, loss-based approaches) and explicitly aiming to address identified challenges like inherent architectural enforcement of symplecticity and bridging to classical ML tasks. The objectives and methodology directly correspond to the goals outlined in the task description and research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It logically progresses from background and motivation to the specific proposed architecture (SympNets), methodology, and evaluation plan. Key concepts like Hamiltonian mechanics, symplecticity, and Hamiltonian splitting are explained clearly. The core architectural idea based on the Leapfrog integrator for separable Hamiltonians is articulated precisely with mathematical formulations. The research objectives are specific and measurable. While the sections on non-separable Hamiltonians and GNN/RNN integration are naturally less detailed, they clearly outline the intended research directions. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow, with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the concept of physics-informed NNs and Hamiltonian NNs exists, the core novelty lies in the proposed architectural design: embedding symplectic integrator structures (specifically Hamiltonian splitting methods like Leapfrog) *directly* into neural network layers to enforce symplecticity by construction. This contrasts with methods relying primarily on loss functions (David & Méhats, 2023), standard integrators with learned Hamiltonians (Greydanus et al., 2019), or flow-based approaches (He & Cai, 2024). Parameterizing the potential and kinetic energy terms (V_\\\\theta, T_\\\\phi) and composing their associated flows according to a symplectic scheme within a layer is a distinct and innovative architectural approach. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in well-established principles of Hamiltonian mechanics and geometric numerical integration (symplectic maps, splitting methods). The mathematical formulation for the core SympNet layer based on Leapfrog for separable Hamiltonians is correct and guarantees symplecticity by construction (as it composes exact symplectic maps derived from learned potentials). Using automatic differentiation to obtain gradients from learned scalar potentials (V_\\\\theta, T_\\\\phi) correctly enforces the conservative nature of the forces. The proposed extensions (non-separable Hamiltonians, GNN/RNN integration) identify appropriate, albeit challenging, theoretical avenues (generating functions, implicit methods). The experimental design, including metrics (energy drift, symplecticity deviation) and baselines, is rigorous and well-suited to validate the claims."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Implementing the core SympNet layer for separable Hamiltonians using standard deep learning frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow) with automatic differentiation is practical and well within current technical capabilities. Generating simulation data or using benchmark datasets is standard practice. The main challenges lie in the proposed extensions: efficiently implementing layers for non-separable Hamiltonians (which might involve implicit solvers or complex generating function parameterizations) and integrating these structures effectively into GNNs and RNNs requires significant engineering effort and carries higher research risk. However, the overall research plan starts with a highly feasible core and progresses towards more challenging aspects, making the project practical to initiate and pursue incrementally."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of standard ML models when applied to physical systems – the lack of adherence to fundamental conservation laws. Success would lead to more reliable, stable, and physically plausible models for scientific simulations (e.g., molecular dynamics, astrophysics), potentially accelerating discovery. Furthermore, exploring the benefits of the symplectic inductive bias in classical ML tasks (video prediction, time series) could lead to methodological advancements in designing robust and data-efficient AI systems more broadly. The work strongly aligns with the goals of the physics-informed ML community and has the potential to make substantial contributions to both scientific computing and machine learning methodology."
