        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of leveraging physics principles (specifically, geometric conservation laws like symplecticity from Hamiltonian mechanics) to create novel ML methods (SympNNs). It aligns perfectly with the research idea by elaborating on symplectic architectures, Hamiltonian splitting, and applications in both physics and classical ML. Furthermore, it situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging related concepts like HNNs and symplectic integrators while proposing a distinct architectural approach focused on layer-wise symplecticity, aiming to address challenges highlighted in the review (e.g., architectural design, non-separable systems)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (including data, algorithmic framework, and validation plan), and expected outcomes are well-defined and presented logically. The core concept of using Hamiltonian splitting and constraints to enforce layer-wise symplecticity is explained with relevant equations. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise parameterization of the symplectic layers and how exact symplecticity will be maintained during training alongside expressivity, especially compared to very recent works cited in the literature review. The connection to classical ML tasks like video prediction could also be slightly more elaborated mechanistically. However, these points do not significantly obscure the overall proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the field of Hamiltonian/symplectic neural networks is active (as shown in the literature review), the specific approach of structuring *layers* as symplectic maps using Hamiltonian splitting combined with constrained optimization appears distinct from methods focusing primarily on learning the Hamiltonian function (HNNs) or using specific numerical integrators. It offers a potentially new architectural perspective. However, given the very recent related work (e.g., He & Cai 2024, Maslovskaya & Ober-Bl√∂baum 2024, Xiong et al. 2022), the novelty might be more in the specific implementation strategy and synthesis rather than being entirely groundbreaking. The proposal could benefit from more explicitly highlighting its unique contributions relative to these recent papers."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, grounded in established principles of Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic geometry. The use of Hamiltonian splitting and the symplectic condition (\\nabla f^T J \\nabla f = J) is theoretically correct. The proposed methodology, including the loss function with regularization and the use of constrained optimization, is appropriate. However, the practical implementation of creating layers that are both strictly symplectic (especially via splitting, which is often simpler for separable Hamiltonians) and sufficiently expressive for complex tasks presents challenges that are not fully detailed. The claim of handling non-separable systems effectively needs more substantiation compared to existing methods like NSSNNs. While the core ideas are sound, the rigor of the proposed implementation details could be strengthened."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard ML resources and publicly available datasets. The required expertise (ML, Hamiltonian mechanics) is reasonable for a specialized research group. Deep learning frameworks allow for custom layer implementation, and constrained optimization techniques exist. However, significant implementation challenges exist in designing and efficiently training layers that strictly enforce symplecticity while maintaining expressivity. Constrained optimization can be complex and computationally expensive. Integrating these layers into diverse architectures (GNNs, Transformers) requires careful engineering. While achievable, these technical hurdles present moderate risks to straightforward execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of standard deep learning models in scientific domains: the lack of adherence to fundamental physical conservation laws. Enforcing symplecticity promises more robust, physically plausible, and potentially data-efficient models for crucial applications like molecular dynamics, fluid simulation, and climate modeling. The potential extension to classical ML tasks (e.g., improving temporal consistency in video prediction) adds breadth. Success would represent a major advancement in physics-informed ML, providing a principled architectural approach with high potential for scientific discovery and industrial relevance (e.g., robotics, energy systems)."
