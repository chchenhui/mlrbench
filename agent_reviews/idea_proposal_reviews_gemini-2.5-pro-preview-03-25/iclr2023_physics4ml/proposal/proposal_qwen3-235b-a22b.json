    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of leveraging physics principles (Hamiltonian mechanics, symplecticity) for novel ML methods. The core idea of symplectic neural networks aligns perfectly with the provided research idea summary. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates and cites numerous relevant papers from the literature review (e.g., 2407.00294, 2106.11753, 2010.12636, 2406.04104, 2305.05540, 2405.16183), grounding the proposed work in the current state-of-the-art and addressing identified challenges. It explicitly discusses applications in both scientific domains (as requested) and classical ML tasks (video prediction, sequence modeling), fulfilling a key aspect of the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, objectives (developing symplectic NNs using Hamiltonian splitting), and methodology (symplectic map condition, loss function structure) are explained logically. The significance and potential impact are clearly stated. The structure flows well from background to expected outcomes. The inclusion of the mathematical definition of a symplectic map enhances clarity. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise parameterization techniques for ensuring layers are symplectic while maintaining expressivity, but the overall concept and plan are understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation, although it operates within a rapidly developing field. The literature review confirms that symplectic and Hamiltonian NNs are active research areas. The novelty lies in the specific proposed approach: combining Hamiltonian splitting methods for layer decomposition with the enforcement of symplectic structures, the explicit adaptation for GNNs mimicking particle interactions, and the focused effort to extend these physics-inspired concepts rigorously to classical ML tasks beyond just mentioning the possibility. It synthesizes recent ideas (e.g., citing work on Poisson NNs for non-symplectic extensions, meta-learning for data efficiency) into a coherent research plan. While not entirely groundbreaking, it offers fresh perspectives and combinations."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in Hamiltonian mechanics, symplectic geometry, and numerical methods (symplectic integration, splitting methods). The proposed methodology, including enforcing the symplectic condition mathematically and using Hamiltonian splitting for layer design, is well-justified and supported by references to relevant literature. The proposed loss function structure is reasonable. The technical formulation for the symplectic condition is correct. While practical implementation might face challenges in balancing constraints with network expressivity (a common issue in constrained optimization), the overall approach is theoretically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core concepts (symplectic maps, Hamiltonian splitting) are established, and related work cited in the literature review demonstrates that implementing structure-preserving networks is possible. Standard deep learning frameworks can be used for implementation. The proposed validation using synthetic and simulation datasets is practical. Expertise in both ML and physics/numerical methods is required but assumed. Key challenges, such as designing expressive yet constrained layers and ensuring stable training, are acknowledged implicitly or explicitly and represent research risks rather than fundamental infeasibility. Initial experiments seem achievable with standard resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations of current deep learning models, namely their lack of physical consistency and potential instability, particularly in modeling dynamical systems. Success would lead to more reliable, robust, and data-efficient models for scientific machine learning (e.g., molecular dynamics, fluid dynamics). Furthermore, the potential extension to classical ML tasks (video, sequences) could offer new ways to enforce temporal coherence and stability. By bridging geometric physics and machine learning, the research has substantial potential to advance both fields and foster interdisciplinary collaboration, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
