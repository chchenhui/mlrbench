    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and mathematical reasoning, which is the central theme of the workshop. It explicitly tackles several key areas mentioned in the task description, including 'Measuring mathematical reasoning' (by proposing a new benchmark), 'New capabilities' (by focusing on explainability beyond just solving problems), 'Education' (by investigating integration into educational settings), and 'Applications' (mentioning education, research, and industry). The focus on explainability also implicitly relates to the 'Humans vs. machines' comparison by aiming for human-understandable outputs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (lack of transparency in AI math reasoning) is well-defined. The main idea is broken down into four distinct and understandable components: model architecture, explanation generation, evaluation benchmarks, and human-AI collaboration. The expected outcomes and potential impact are clearly articulated, leaving little room for ambiguity. The proposal is concise and easy to grasp."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While research on LLMs for mathematical reasoning and explainable AI (XAI) exists separately, this proposal focuses specifically on integrating step-by-step, natural language explanation generation directly within LLMs tailored for mathematical tasks. Creating dedicated benchmarks that include human-understandable explanations alongside problems is also a novel contribution. While it builds on existing concepts (LLMs, attention, XAI), the specific combination and application to produce verifiable reasoning steps in mathematics offer a fresh perspective compared to simply solving problems or providing generic explanations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant technical challenges. Designing LLM architectures and attention mechanisms is standard, but developing a module that reliably generates accurate, faithful, and truly human-understandable step-by-step explanations for complex mathematical reasoning is a major hurdle. Ensuring the explanation correctly reflects the model's internal process is non-trivial. Creating a comprehensive benchmark with high-quality explanations requires substantial effort and resources. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation, especially the explanation generation part, pushes the boundaries of current LLM capabilities and XAI techniques, making it challenging but not impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds excellent significance and potential impact. Addressing the lack of transparency and explainability in AI's mathematical reasoning is crucial for building trust and enabling reliable deployment in critical areas like scientific discovery, engineering, and finance. The potential to enhance mathematics education through explainable AI tutors is particularly impactful. Success in this area could lead to major advancements in human-AI collaboration, improve AI's reasoning capabilities through better error analysis, and contribute significantly to the broader field of trustworthy AI."
