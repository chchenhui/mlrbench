    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the intersection of LLMs and mathematical reasoning, focusing on understanding how models 'comprehend' mathematics through explainability. It proposes a 'new capability' (hybrid KG-LLM system) to improve reasoning and transparency. Furthermore, it explicitly mentions target applications like education and science, which are highlighted topics in the workshop call. The goal of making reasoning steps transparent aligns well with the theme of evaluating the extent of machine comprehension in mathematics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated. The motivation (black-box nature of LLMs in math reasoning) is well-defined, and the proposed solution (dynamic KG construction integrated with LLMs) is explained conceptually. The key components (nodes, edges) and intended benefits (explainability, enhanced reasoning, error detection) are listed. While the high-level concept is clear, specific details about the dynamic interaction mechanism between the LLM and the KG could be further elaborated for perfect clarity, but it's well-defined for a research idea summary."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While combining LLMs and KGs has been explored in other contexts, the specific proposal of dynamically constructing a mathematical reasoning graph *during* the problem-solving process, driven by the LLM to explicitly represent each step for explainability, is innovative. This contrasts with approaches using static KGs or relying solely on LLM's internal states or chain-of-thought prompting for reasoning. The focus on using the KG structure itself as the primary medium for explainability in mathematical reasoning is a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Integrating LLMs with dynamic KG construction requires careful engineering. Ensuring the KG accurately reflects the LLM's reasoning, handling potential LLM errors or hallucinations during graph updates, and managing the computational cost of dynamic graph operations are significant hurdles. Defining appropriate explainability metrics beyond accuracy also requires careful consideration. While challenging, it builds upon existing technologies (LLMs, KGs) and seems achievable within a research context, albeit requiring considerable effort and potentially new techniques for robust integration."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Addressing the lack of explainability and trustworthiness in LLM-based mathematical reasoning is a critical problem. Success in this area could unlock the reliable use of LLMs in high-stakes domains like education (personalized tutoring with understandable feedback), scientific research (verifying complex derivations or proofs), and potentially finance or engineering. Improving the transparency of complex reasoning processes would be a major advancement, fostering trust and enabling better human-AI collaboration in mathematics and related fields."
