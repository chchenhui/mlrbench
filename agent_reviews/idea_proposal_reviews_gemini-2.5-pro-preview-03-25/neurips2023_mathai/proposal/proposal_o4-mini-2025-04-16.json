        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on LLMs and mathematical reasoning, particularly the questions around comprehension, capabilities, and applications (education, science). It perfectly embodies the research idea of using dynamic KGs for explainable math reasoning in LLMs. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, referencing key works like GCR (Luo et al., 2024) and relevant benchmarks (U-MATH, MathBench, etc.), while explicitly aiming to tackle challenges like explainability and multi-step reasoning identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the hybrid architecture, KG construction, dynamic updates (including action types and prompt examples), graph-constrained decoding (with formal definition), and the overall algorithmic pipeline (with pseudocode). The experimental design is thorough, and implementation details are specified. The structure is logical, flowing smoothly from motivation to methods, evaluation, and impact."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While leveraging existing concepts like LLMs for math, KGs in reasoning (KG-GPT, RoG), and graph-constrained decoding (GCR), its core contribution – having the LLM dynamically construct and update a problem-specific KG by emitting explicit graph operations as reasoning steps – appears innovative. This dynamic, LLM-driven graph manipulation for explainability and faithfulness distinguishes it from prior work focusing on static KG retrieval or path planning. The integration of these specific components in a dynamic loop is a fresh approach."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations (LLMs, KGs, GNNs, constrained decoding). The proposed methodology is coherent and technically well-grounded, utilizing established techniques like SBERT for retrieval and GCR for decoding. The inclusion of specific action types for graph updates and pseudocode enhances rigor. The experimental design is robust, featuring relevant recent benchmarks, appropriate baselines (including ablations), comprehensive metrics covering both accuracy and explainability, and plans for statistical analysis. Technical formulations like the GCR equation are correctly presented."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires substantial computational resources (8x A100 GPUs), access to large LLMs, and expertise across LLMs, KGs, and GNNs. Key challenges include effectively fine-tuning the LLM to generate structured graph operations, integrating diverse knowledge sources into the background KG, ensuring the scalability of dynamic graph updates and constrained decoding, and conducting rigorous human evaluation for explainability metrics. While the plan uses existing tools, the integration complexity and achieving the ambitious performance targets introduce manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of explainability, reliability, and robustness in LLM-based mathematical reasoning. These limitations hinder trust and deployment in critical areas. By aiming to produce transparent, verifiable reasoning traces via dynamic KGs, the research has the potential for major impact. Success could lead to advancements in educational technology (intelligent tutors), automated theorem proving (bridging informal/formal methods), scientific discovery (verifiable modeling), and the broader field of trustworthy and explainable AI."
