        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's theme of Bayesian decision-making and uncertainty. It directly addresses the call to explore how frontier models like LLMs can enhance Bayesian methods, specifically by providing stronger priors for sequential experimental design. It targets critical applications (scientific discovery) where uncertainty quantification and adaptive decision-making are essential, fitting squarely within the workshop's scope and target audience interests (Bayesian optimization, sequential experimental design, UQ)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main idea (two-stage methodology), proposed techniques (LLM prompting, prior generation, sequential design with GPs/BNNs, continual adaptation), evaluation plan (specific benchmarks), and expected outcomes are all clearly defined and immediately understandable. Minor details on the exact mechanism for translating LLM outputs to calibrated priors could be elaborated, but the overall concept is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly original and innovative. While using Bayesian methods for experimental design is established, systematically leveraging LLMs to generate informative, domain-specific priors *for* sequential experimental design is a novel approach. The integration involves parsing LLM knowledge into formal probabilistic structures and includes a continual adaptation loop via re-prompting, representing a significant departure from traditional prior elicitation methods and pushing the boundary of combining LLMs with Bayesian workflows."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technologies. LLMs can be prompted for domain knowledge, and Bayesian sequential design frameworks (GPs, BNNs, acquisition functions) are well-established. However, the crucial step of reliably parsing potentially noisy or qualitative LLM outputs into well-calibrated, quantitative prior distributions poses a significant research challenge. Ensuring the robustness and accuracy of this translation is key to the method's success and requires careful methodological development and validation. The computational cost of frequent LLM calls also needs consideration, though likely less than the cost of physical experiments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant with substantial potential impact. It addresses the critical problem of inefficient experimentation in science and engineering due to weak priors or high costs. By potentially accelerating convergence and reducing experimental burden in fields like chemistry and materials science, it could lead to major advancements in scientific discovery. Methodologically, it offers a powerful new paradigm for incorporating vast codified knowledge (from LLMs) into rigorous Bayesian decision-making frameworks, impacting both ML research and its application."
