    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of enhancing Bayesian methods (specifically BO) with frontier models (LLMs) by incorporating prior knowledge. The proposal meticulously expands on the research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology, and evaluation plan. It also situates itself well within the provided literature, acknowledging related work (LLAMBO, AutoElicit) and addressing the key challenges identified (reliability, interpretability, etc.). All sections consistently reinforce the central theme and objectives."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a strong motivation and background, clearly listing objectives, detailing the methodology step-by-step (problem formulation, prompting, parsing, integration, evaluation), and outlining expected outcomes. The language is precise, technical concepts are explained adequately, and the experimental design is unambiguous. It is immediately understandable with minimal room for misinterpretation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the core idea of using LLMs for prior elicitation in Bayesian contexts (including BO) is emerging and being explored by others (as indicated by the provided literature review, including papers like AutoElicit and several hypothetical ones directly on LLM priors for BO), this proposal offers a specific, integrated framework. The novelty lies less in the fundamental concept and more in the proposed implementation details (specific prompting strategies, parsing mechanisms, refinement loop) and the comprehensive empirical validation plan across different domains against relevant baselines. It represents a valuable contribution to an active research area rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations of Bayesian Optimization and Gaussian Processes. The proposed methodology leverages established LLM techniques (structured prompting, CoT, few-shot) and standard BO practices. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant benchmarks, baselines (acknowledging SOTA like LLAMBO), metrics, and ablation studies. The proposal also realistically acknowledges key technical challenges, such as the reliability of LLM outputs and interpretability. The technical formulations provided are correct. Minor refinements might be needed for the optional refinement loop, but the core approach is well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing technologies (LLMs, BO libraries) and standard computational resources typically available in research settings. The outlined steps (prompt engineering, parser development, integration, experimentation) are logical and achievable. The scope, including synthetic and real-world tasks, is ambitious but manageable. The main risk, concerning the effectiveness and reliability of LLM-generated priors, is inherent to the research question but doesn't render the project infeasible; rather, it's a central point of investigation. The plan appears realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical bottleneck in Bayesian Optimization – the difficulty of specifying informative priors – which hinders its application in complex, expensive real-world problems like scientific discovery (a key theme of the task description). Automating prior elicitation using LLMs could drastically improve BO efficiency and democratize its use. Success would represent a substantial contribution to both the BO and LLM communities, potentially accelerating research in various scientific domains. The alignment with the workshop's goals is excellent."
