    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of enhancing Bayesian methods (specifically BO) using new tools like LLMs to handle uncertainty and prior knowledge integration. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes perfectly reflect the provided research idea. It also fits well within the context established by the literature review, focusing on a topic (LLM-guided prior elicitation for BO) that is clearly current and relevant according to the cited papers."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, significance, methodology outline (LLM prompting, BO framework, evaluation metrics, experimental phases), and expected outcomes are presented logically and are easy to understand. However, it could benefit from slightly more detail on the specific mechanism for translating the LLM's natural language output or suggestions into concrete, quantitative parameters for the GP prior (e.g., how kernel types or hyperparameter ranges are formally extracted and validated). Despite this minor lack of detail, the overall proposal is well-defined."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The proposal suffers significantly in terms of novelty, primarily due to the provided literature review. The review lists numerous very recent papers (2024-2025, including several pre-prints with specific titles like 'Bayesian Optimization with Prior Elicitation via Large Language Models' and application-specific variants) that appear to address the exact same research idea: using LLMs to elicit or generate priors for Bayesian Optimization by processing natural language descriptions. The proposal does not articulate any specific methodological innovation, unique perspective, or significant extension beyond what seems to be already actively explored and published in the field according to the literature context provided. It essentially describes the general concept that is the subject of the cited works."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but lacks rigor in key areas. It builds upon established foundations (Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian Processes). The core idea of leveraging LLM knowledge for priors is conceptually plausible. However, the methodology lacks detail on how the LLM output will be reliably translated into valid and *informative* GP priors. It doesn't address the 'Quality and Reliability' challenge explicitly mentioned in the literature review's key challenges section. There's no discussion of how to handle potentially noisy, incorrect, or non-quantitative suggestions from the LLM, nor how to validate the generated priors before using them. The evaluation plan using standard metrics and comparison is sound, but the core mechanism of prior generation lacks sufficient methodological detail and rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Access to LLMs (via APIs or open-source models) and BO libraries is common in ML research. Benchmark experiments are straightforward. Real-world applications (HPT, materials, drug discovery) are feasible assuming access to relevant problem descriptions and evaluation functions/data. The main challenge lies in the practical implementation of the LLM-to-prior generation step â€“ significant prompt engineering and output processing might be required to get consistently useful priors, which could be more effort-intensive than implied. However, the overall plan is generally realistic with manageable technical risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research addresses an important problem: improving the efficiency and accessibility of Bayesian Optimization, particularly for expensive-to-evaluate functions where informative priors are crucial. Success in this area could lead to faster scientific discovery and engineering design optimization, as highlighted in the proposal. It aligns well with the workshop's focus on advancing Bayesian methods. While the novelty is low, empirically demonstrating a robust and effective method for LLM-based prior elicitation across different domains would still be a valuable contribution to the field, offering practical insights even if the core concept is known."
