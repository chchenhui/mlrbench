    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of enhancing Bayesian methods (specifically BO) using frontier models (LLMs) to incorporate prior knowledge and improve efficiency. It fully elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the motivation, LLM's role in eliciting priors (structural and parametric), and evaluation strategy. Furthermore, it situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging related approaches like LLAMBO and AutoElicit, and addressing key challenges identified in the review, such as prior quality and interpretability. The proposed LLM-PEBO framework directly tackles the problem of prior specification highlighted as a key challenge in BO."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the objectives. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the proposed LLM-PEBO framework, including problem processing, the two-stage prior elicitation pipeline (structural and parametric), BO integration, and the feedback mechanism. The experimental design is comprehensive and unambiguous, specifying benchmarks, real-world applications, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Expected outcomes, impact, limitations, and future work are also clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the proposal immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality within the rapidly evolving field of LLM-enhanced BO. While using LLMs to aid BO is not entirely new (as evidenced by cited works like LLAMBO), this proposal focuses specifically and systematically on *prior elicitation* from natural language descriptions, distinguishing between structural (kernel, relevance) and parametric (length scales, variances) priors. This structured elicitation pipeline, combined with the proposed feedback mechanism to refine priors based on initial BO results, offers a fresh perspective compared to methods that might use LLMs more directly within the optimization loop. However, the literature review includes several (potentially hypothetical) papers with very similar titles/summaries, suggesting the core idea might be concurrently explored or recently published, making the novelty good but perhaps not entirely groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established Bayesian Optimization principles (GPs, acquisition functions) and leverages the known capabilities of LLMs for natural language understanding. The proposed methodology, breaking down prior elicitation into structural and parametric components, is logical within the GP framework. The inclusion of a feedback loop to refine priors is a sensible addition to address potential LLM inaccuracies. The experimental design is rigorous, including diverse tasks, strong baselines (like LLAMBO), multiple relevant metrics, and ablation studies. The technical formulations are appropriate for a proposal. The main uncertainty, acknowledged by the authors, lies in the practical reliability and accuracy of LLM-generated priors, which is the core research question being investigated."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required components – large language models (accessible via APIs or open-source models), Bayesian Optimization libraries, and computational resources for experiments – are readily available in typical ML research environments. The implementation steps (prompt engineering, output parsing, integration with BO framework, feedback loop) are complex but achievable. The experimental plan is ambitious, requiring significant computational effort for evaluation across multiple benchmarks and applications, but it is well-defined and realistic for a dedicated research project. The primary risk revolves around the effectiveness of prompt engineering and the inherent variability/reliability of LLM outputs, but mitigating this is part of the proposed research."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in Bayesian Optimization: the specification of informative priors, which directly impacts sample efficiency, especially for expensive black-box functions common in scientific discovery and engineering. By proposing a method to leverage readily available LLMs to translate qualitative domain knowledge into quantitative priors, the research has the potential to make BO more effective, efficient, and accessible to non-experts. Success could lead to accelerated scientific discovery, reduced experimental costs, and democratized access to advanced optimization techniques, aligning perfectly with the goals outlined in the workshop task description."
