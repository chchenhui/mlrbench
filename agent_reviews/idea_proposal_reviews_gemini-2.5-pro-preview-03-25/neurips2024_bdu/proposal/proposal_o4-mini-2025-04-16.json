    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of enhancing Bayesian methods (specifically BO) with frontier models (LLMs) to incorporate prior knowledge and improve decision-making under uncertainty. The proposal operationalizes the research idea precisely, focusing on LLM-guided prior elicitation for BO. It explicitly acknowledges and positions itself relative to the recent works mentioned in the literature review (AutoElicit, LLAMBO, LLANA), planning to compare against them. The objectives, methodology, and evaluation strategy are all tightly linked to the provided context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology, evaluation, and impact. The research objectives are stated concisely. The methodology section clearly outlines the problem formulation, the steps for LLM-based prior elicitation (prompting, parsing, hyperprior construction), the overall algorithm, and a detailed experimental plan. Technical concepts are used precisely, and the language is unambiguous. The inclusion of a prompt example and structured output format further enhances clarity. It is immediately understandable what the research aims to achieve and how."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core idea of using LLMs to elicit priors for Bayesian Optimization is not fundamentally new, as evidenced by the provided literature review which lists several very recent papers (2024-2025) exploring this exact concept (e.g., AutoElicit, LLAMBO, LLANA, and papers 5-9). A survey paper on the topic is even mentioned. The novelty primarily lies in the proposed specific implementation ('LLM-BO-Prior' framework with structured prompting/parsing) and the emphasis on a systematic, comprehensive evaluation across diverse task types (synthetic, HPO, scientific) and against multiple relevant baselines, including the latest LLM-based methods. It aims to provide a robust framework and comparative analysis rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in well-established Bayesian Optimization principles (Gaussian Processes, acquisition functions, importance of priors). The proposed methodology is technically robust: the pipeline for prior elicitation is logical, using structured LLM output is practical, the method for constructing hyperpriors from ranges is mathematically defined, and the overall BO algorithm is standard. The experimental design is comprehensive and rigorous, including appropriate task categories, strong baselines (including expert and recent LLM methods), standard evaluation metrics, and a plan for statistical analysis. Technical formulations are correct and clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible. It relies on readily available resources: LLM APIs (like GPT-4), standard Python libraries for BO (GPyTorch, BoTorch), and typical computational resources (CPU cluster). The technical steps involved – prompt engineering, JSON parsing, integrating priors into BO frameworks, running experiments – are standard practices in ML research. Potential risks, such as LLM performance variability, are acknowledged as part of the research investigation. Obtaining expert priors and implementing baselines are manageable challenges. The plan is realistic and implementation appears straightforward."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is significant and has clear impact potential. Automating the elicitation of informative priors for BO addresses a key bottleneck, potentially making BO more efficient and accessible, especially for complex, expensive scientific discovery problems. This aligns perfectly with the goals outlined in the task description. Success could accelerate research in fields like materials science and drug discovery. Furthermore, the work contributes valuable insights into the reliability and utility of LLMs for extracting structured scientific knowledge and integrating it into principled decision-making frameworks like BO. While the core idea exists in recent literature, a systematic and robustly evaluated framework would still be a valuable contribution to this active research area."
