    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding pre-training data's role in emergent capabilities, specifically tackling the question of which data subsets are most important. The methodology closely follows the research idea, detailing the steps for identifying data clusters, perturbing representations, and measuring impact. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself against the gaps identified in the literature review, aiming to provide causal links and representation-level insights missing in prior work like Du et al. (2024) and Wei et al. (2022)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed and unambiguous. The methodology is presented in a logical, step-by-step manner (Data Clustering, Subspace Construction, Perturbation & Causal Mediation, Experimental Setup, Evaluation) with sufficient technical detail (e.g., PCA equations, perturbation formulas) to understand the proposed approach. The rationale, significance, and expected outcomes are clearly articulated, making the proposal easy to follow and comprehend."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While techniques like PCA, representation perturbation, and causal mediation analysis exist individually, their synthesis to probe the influence of specific *pre-training data clusters* on *emergent reasoning abilities* by manipulating *representation subspaces* is a novel approach. It moves beyond correlational studies or holistic analyses (like overall loss) to offer a more fine-grained, potentially causal understanding at the representation level. The explicit aim to link data subsets to specific subspaces and then to capabilities distinguishes it from the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is methodologically sound and rigorous. It builds upon established techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction and representation analysis, and intervention-based methods for probing. The use of PCA to define data-associated subspaces is a reasonable hypothesis to test. The perturbation methods (ablation, amplification) are clearly defined. The inclusion of control experiments (random subspace ablation) strengthens the design. While applying causal mediation analysis terminology requires careful interpretation (as it's an intervention on the mediator/representation, not the original treatment/data), the underlying principle of measuring the effect flowing through specific representation components is sound. The evaluation plan includes appropriate metrics and statistical analyses."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on accessible pre-trained models (LLaMA-7B open weights), standard datasets (GSM8K, BIG-Bench, text corpora proxies), and established computational techniques (PCA, model inference, embedding extraction). While computationally intensive (requiring significant GPU resources for activation collection and experiments), it is within the realm of typical FM research. The main challenges are research risks rather than feasibility blockers, such as ensuring PCA subspaces effectively capture distinct data influences and managing the complexity of large-scale experiments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the field: understanding the origins of emergent abilities in foundation models, specifically the role of pre-training data. Successfully identifying which data subsets contribute to crucial capabilities like reasoning would have major impacts on efficient model development (targeted data curation), AI safety (mitigating undesirable behaviors by removing problematic data influences), and fundamental theoretical understanding (bridging scaling laws and mechanistic explanations). The potential contributions are substantial and align perfectly with the goals of the workshop."
