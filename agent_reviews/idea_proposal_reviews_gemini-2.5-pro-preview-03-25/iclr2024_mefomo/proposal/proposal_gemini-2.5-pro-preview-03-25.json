    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for understanding pre-training data influence ('Understanding the data' topic) and emergent phenomena ('Scale-driven capabilities' topic). The methodology is a direct operationalization of the research idea (probing data influence via representation perturbation). It explicitly aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the literature review (identifying critical subsets, perturbation techniques, measuring impact, causality, data curation). The objectives and significance sections clearly connect the proposed work back to the goals outlined in the task description and the core concepts from the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to specific objectives, a detailed methodology, and expected outcomes. Key concepts like 'representation perturbation', 'cluster directions', 'ablation', and 'steering' are explained well. The methodology section provides specific techniques (e.g., Difference of Means, CAVs, specific perturbation equations) and outlines a clear experimental plan, including controls. The objectives are specific and measurable. There is minimal ambiguity, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While techniques like representation analysis (e.g., CAVs) and representation perturbation/steering exist in interpretability and model control literature, the novelty lies in the specific application and synthesis of these methods to systematically quantify the influence of *pre-training data subsets* on *emergent abilities*. It proposes moving beyond correlational studies or costly retraining experiments by using targeted interventions within the representation space based on identified data cluster directions. This specific framing and methodological approach to link pre-training data types to high-level emergent skills via representation manipulation offers a fresh perspective compared to existing work cited, which focuses more on the phenomenon of emergence itself or loss dynamics."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous. It builds on the reasonable assumption that representations encode data properties relevant to capabilities. The methodology employs established techniques for finding directions (probes, CAVs) and perturbing representations (ablation, steering). The inclusion of control conditions (random/orthogonal directions, non-targeted clusters) significantly strengthens the experimental design. However, there are some points impacting full soundness: 1) Reliance on proxy pre-training data introduces uncertainty. 2) Methods for finding directions often assume linear separability or representation, which might be a simplification. 3) The causal link between perturbing a derived representation direction and the effect of the actual data subset during training is indirect, an acknowledged approximation. 4) Emergent abilities might result from complex interactions not fully captured by perturbing single directions. Technical formulations provided are correct."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It plans to use publicly available models (LLaMA 2, Pythia) and datasets (Pile, SlimPajama, standard benchmarks), mitigating access issues. The computational requirements (inference, linear model training, running benchmarks) are manageable with standard research lab resources (GPU clusters). The proposed techniques (activation extraction, vector math, simple classifiers, model hooking) are technically achievable using existing ML libraries. The plan to start with mid-sized models (7B) is practical. The main challenge, acknowledged in the proposal, is the use of proxy data, but this is a common and accepted practice. Potential risks exist (e.g., difficulty finding clear directions, perturbations causing instability), but the overall plan is realistic."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and critical gap in our understanding of foundation models: how specific aspects of the vast pre-training data contribute to the emergence of complex capabilities. This is central to the workshop's theme. Successfully developing the proposed methodology and generating the 'data influence map' would be a major contribution to FM science. The potential impact extends to practical applications like more efficient data curation for pre-training (potentially reducing compute/data needs), better model control, and informing efforts in AI safety and alignment by understanding how data shapes behavior-relevant representations."
