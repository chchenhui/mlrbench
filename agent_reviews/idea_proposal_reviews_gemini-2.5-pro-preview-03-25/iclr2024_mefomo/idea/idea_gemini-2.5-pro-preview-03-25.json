        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme of understanding Foundation Models. It directly addresses key topics listed under 'Pre-Training', specifically 'Understanding the data' (investigating important data subsets) and 'Generalization, transfer, and representation learning' (analyzing learned representations). Furthermore, it connects pre-training data to 'Emergent phenomena' by focusing on how data influences emergent abilities like reasoning. The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of developing a better understanding of FMs to guide future development and mitigation strategies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core hypothesis, and proposed methodology (identify clusters, perturb representations, measure impact) are understandable. It specifies the target phenomena (emergent abilities), potential methods (representation engineering, causal mediation analysis), and evaluation benchmarks (GSM8K, BIG-Bench). Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise techniques for identifying data clusters within potentially unlabeled pre-training corpora and the exact mechanisms for mapping these clusters to representation components for perturbation, but the overall research direction is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While analyzing representations and data influence are existing research areas, the proposed approach of systematically linking pre-training data *clusters* to specific representation *components* and then perturbing/ablating these components to causally probe their effect on *emergent abilities* is a relatively novel combination. It moves beyond standard influence functions or data attribution by focusing on the representational level and its connection to high-level capabilities, offering a fresh perspective on understanding data's role in shaping complex model behaviors."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Accessing pre-trained models and their representations is possible for open models. Evaluating on downstream tasks is standard. However, reliably identifying meaningful data clusters in massive pre-training datasets (especially if metadata is limited) is difficult. Furthermore, precisely mapping these clusters to specific, manipulable components within the high-dimensional representation space and performing targeted perturbations/ablations using techniques like representation engineering or causal mediation analysis is complex and computationally intensive. Success depends heavily on the effectiveness of these representation analysis and manipulation techniques at scale."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Understanding how specific types of pre-training data contribute to the emergence of advanced capabilities like reasoning is a fundamental challenge in FM research. Successfully identifying critical data subsets and their representational correlates could lead to major advancements in efficient data curation for pre-training, targeted development of desired abilities, mitigation of unwanted behaviors stemming from problematic data, and a deeper theoretical understanding of how FMs learn complex skills. The potential impact on the field is substantial."
