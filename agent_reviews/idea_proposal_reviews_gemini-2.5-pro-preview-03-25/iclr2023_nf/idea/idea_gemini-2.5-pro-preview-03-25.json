        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly asks 'What representation can we use for neural fields in order to extract high level information from them and solve downstream tasks? What novel architectures do we need to extract such information from these representations?'. The proposed idea directly addresses this by suggesting auxiliary prediction heads as an architectural modification to neural fields for extracting high-level semantic information (object class, material type, etc.) directly. It also aligns with the goal of expanding neural field applications to areas like robotics and simulation, mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (difficulty in extracting high-level info from standard neural fields). The core proposal (augmenting with auxiliary heads trained concurrently) is well-defined and easy to understand. Specific examples (semantic labels, material properties) and expected outcomes (enriched representations for downstream tasks) are provided, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Using auxiliary heads or multi-task learning is a well-established technique in deep learning. However, its specific application to neural fields for direct, continuous querying of diverse high-level attributes (semantic, geometric, physical) directly from coordinates or intermediate features is a relevant and timely contribution within the neural fields community. While related concepts like semantic NeRF exist, this proposal frames it as a more general mechanism ('auxiliary prediction heads') applicable to various attributes. It's more of a smart adaptation and extension of existing ideas to a specific context rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Adding auxiliary prediction heads to existing neural field architectures (typically MLPs) is technically straightforward. Concurrent training is standard practice in multi-task learning. The main challenges would be: 1) Acquiring or generating suitable supervised data (e.g., per-point semantic labels, material properties) aligned with the neural field's input coordinates, which might be difficult for complex real-world scenes. 2) Potential optimization difficulties in balancing the primary reconstruction loss and auxiliary losses, although standard techniques can likely mitigate this. Overall, implementation is practical with current ML frameworks and knowledge."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a well-recognized limitation of basic neural fields â€“ their lack of explicit high-level understanding. Enabling direct querying of semantic or physical properties would make neural fields much more useful for downstream tasks requiring structured information, such as robotic interaction planning, scene graph generation, material-aware simulation, and detailed scene analysis. This could broaden the applicability of neural fields beyond pure reconstruction and rendering, aligning with the workshop's goal of exploring applications in diverse fields."
