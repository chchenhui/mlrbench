        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core MFM-EAI challenges outlined in the task description, such as effective system architectures, bridging high-level reasoning and low-level control, and augmenting agent capabilities. The proposed HiMAC architecture is a direct and detailed elaboration of the two-tiered MFM-HRL system described in the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates the cited literature, using PaLM-E [2] as context for MFM-EAI and leveraging HRL concepts from [1, 3, 4] to justify the hierarchical control component. The identified challenges [Challenges 1-5] from the literature review are explicitly targeted in the objectives and methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The HiMAC architecture, including the roles of the frozen MFM and the HRL controller (high-level and low-level policies), is explained precisely with clear descriptions of inputs, outputs, and objectives (including mathematical formulations). The training process, self-supervised bootstrapping mechanism, and experimental design (tasks, baselines, metrics) are articulated with high clarity, leaving little room for ambiguity. The language used is precise and technical, suitable for a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality and innovation. While utilizing existing components like MFMs and HRL, the specific architectural integration – using a *frozen* MFM to provide structured semantic guidance (maps, affordances, goals) to an HRL agent's high-level policy – is a novel approach within the MFM-EAI context. This contrasts with end-to-end models like PaLM-E [2] or standard HRL approaches [1, 3, 4] that don't typically leverage MFMs in this structured, hierarchical manner. The proposed self-supervised bootstrapping mechanism using MFM-generated pseudo-instructions further adds to the novelty. The proposal clearly distinguishes its approach from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in MFMs for perception and HRL for control. The rationale for combining them to bridge the semantic-control gap is well-argued. The proposed methodology, including the two-tier architecture, the use of established RL algorithms (SAC, PPO), pre-training low-level skills, and the detailed experimental plan, is technically robust. The mathematical formulations for the RL objectives are correct. Minor potential weaknesses exist, such as the assumption that a frozen MFM can reliably produce actionable affordance maps without fine-tuning, but the overall approach is well-justified and technically coherent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The required components (MFMs, HRL algorithms, simulators like Habitat/AI2-THOR) are available. However, integrating these complex systems and training the HRL agent effectively, especially the high-level policy coordinating skills based on MFM outputs, will require substantial computational resources, engineering effort, and expertise in both MFM integration and HRL. Debugging and tuning HRL systems are notoriously difficult. While the plan is realistic and includes sensible steps like pre-training skills, the inherent complexity and potential integration hurdles make the feasibility good but not excellent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly tackles a critical and timely problem in the MFM-EAI field: effectively grounding the high-level understanding of MFMs in low-level robotic actions [Challenge 1]. By aiming to improve sample efficiency [Challenge 2] and generalization [Challenge 3] through a structured MFM-HRL approach, the research has the potential to lead to major advancements in creating more capable, adaptable, and autonomous embodied agents. Success would provide valuable insights into MFM-EAI architectures and could serve as a blueprint for future systems in areas like assistive robotics and automated logistics, strongly aligning with the goals of the MFM-EAI workshop."
