    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core questions posed in the task description, such as effective system architectures for MFM-based agents, balancing high-level decision-making with low-level control, and training/evaluation in open-ended environments. The proposed hierarchical architecture (MFM + HRL) perfectly matches the research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review (bridging semantics/control, sample efficiency, generalization, sim-to-real transfer) and positions itself relative to the cited works (PaLM-E, H2O2)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology section details the proposed architecture (Semantic Planner, Hierarchical Controller), training phases (Self-supervised pre-training, Joint HRL), and experimental design (benchmarks, baselines, metrics, real-world validation). The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of the low-level hidden state H_t^{LL} used in the high-level policy's state representation, and the reliance on a 'Fig. 1' which is not provided. However, these do not significantly impede overall understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While utilizing existing components like MFMs (CLIP/GPT-4V) and HRL algorithms (DDPG, SAC), the core novelty lies in their specific integration: using a frozen MFM to generate semantic affordances and goal representations that directly structure the state space and potentially rewards for an HRL controller. This hierarchical decoupling contrasts with end-to-end MFM approaches (like PaLM-E) and standard HRL (like H2O2) which lack MFM grounding. The proposed self-supervised training loop using MFM-generated pseudo-labels for HRL is also a novel element in this context."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in MFMs, HRL, and self-supervised learning. The proposed two-tiered architecture is logical, leveraging the strengths of MFMs for perception/semantics and HRL for control learning. The choice of specific algorithms (Transformer, DDPG, SAC) is appropriate. The training methodology, including reward shaping and curriculum learning, is well-reasoned. Technical formulations for rewards are provided, although specific state representations could be more detailed. The approach directly addresses challenges identified in the literature, lending it credibility."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology (MFMs, simulators, RL libraries, robots). However, the implementation presents significant engineering challenges. Integrating MFMs with HRL systems is complex, training hierarchical policies can be unstable and sample-intensive (despite efforts to improve efficiency), and robust self-supervised pseudo-label generation requires careful design. Sim-to-real transfer remains a notoriously difficult problem, and achieving the targeted 70% efficiency is ambitious. Success requires substantial computational resources, expertise in both MFMs and HRL, and potentially access to robotics hardware. The scope is broad, making timely completion challenging but manageable with adequate resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical bottleneck in Embodied AI: effectively grounding high-level semantic reasoning from powerful MFMs into low-level robotic actions. Success would enable robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in unstructured environments based on natural language instructions, representing a major advancement for applications like home assistance and industrial automation. The work also promises theoretical insights into hierarchical representation learning that bridges semantics and control. The potential contributions are substantial and clearly articulated."
