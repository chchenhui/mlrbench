    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core questions posed in the MFM-EAI task description, such as effective system architectures, balancing high-level MFM capabilities with low-level control, and training/evaluation strategies. The proposal meticulously elaborates on the research idea, detailing the two-tiered MFM+HRL architecture, the use of semantic affordances/goals, and the self-supervised training approach. Furthermore, it explicitly grounds itself in the provided literature, citing relevant works like PaLM-E and HRL papers (H2O2, HIDIO), and directly tackles the key challenges identified in the review (bridging semantics/control, sample efficiency, generalization, multimodal integration, sim-to-real)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a clear background and motivation, outlining specific research objectives, detailing the proposed methodology (architecture, training, evaluation), and discussing expected outcomes and impact. Key concepts like the MFM and HRL tiers, affordance maps, goal representations, and the different policy levels are explained clearly. The training stages and evaluation plan are well-articulated. While minor details about specific network implementations or the exact nature of the latent subgoal space could be slightly more specified, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing concepts from MFMs and HRL in a specific and well-motivated architecture. While using MFMs for perception and HRL for control are individually established areas, the proposed two-tiered structure where a frozen MFM explicitly generates semantic affordance maps and goal representations as direct input for a high-level HRL policy is a distinct approach. The integration of MFM-guided self-supervised exploration, where the MFM generates pseudo-instructions and affordances to bootstrap HRL, adds a significant layer of novelty compared to standard exploration techniques. It's not proposing a fundamentally new MFM or RL algorithm but offers a novel and well-reasoned integration strategy within the MFM-EAI landscape, clearly distinguishing itself from prior work like end-to-end models (PaLM-E) or pure HRL systems."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in both multi-modal learning and hierarchical reinforcement learning. The proposed two-tiered architecture is logically structured, leveraging the strengths of pre-trained MFMs for semantic understanding while allowing task-specific adaptation through the HRL controller. The methodology is robust, employing established techniques like imitation learning, RL (with HHER), contrastive learning, and supervised learning for different components. The technical formulations provided for the system components and loss functions are appropriate and clearly presented. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse tasks, and sim-to-real transfer assessment, indicating methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges and resource requirements. Integrating complex MFM and HRL systems, training them effectively across multiple stages, and achieving successful sim-to-real transfer are demanding tasks. The proposal acknowledges the need for substantial computational resources (multiple GPUs, distributed training) and expertise in diverse AI domains. While the use of pre-trained models, standard simulators, and established learning algorithms enhances feasibility, the complexity of the overall system and the inherent difficulties of sim-to-real transfer introduce manageable but non-trivial risks. The plan is realistic for a well-equipped research group but requires careful execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem at the intersection of MFMs and Embodied AI: bridging high-level semantic understanding with low-level physical control. This is a fundamental challenge hindering the development of truly adaptable and versatile robots. Successfully developing the proposed framework could lead to major advancements in embodied agent capabilities, particularly in terms of adaptability, sample efficiency, and the ability to follow complex instructions in open-ended environments. The potential impact spans robotics applications in homes, healthcare, and industry, and could significantly influence future research directions in MFM-EAI. The expected contributions are substantial and clearly articulated."
