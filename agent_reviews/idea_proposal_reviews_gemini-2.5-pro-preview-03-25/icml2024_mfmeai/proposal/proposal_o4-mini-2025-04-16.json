        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task description: bridging high-level MFM capabilities with low-level embodied control. The proposed two-tiered architecture (MFM + HRL) perfectly matches the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal explicitly incorporates insights and addresses challenges identified in the provided literature review (e.g., citing H2O2, PaLM-E, addressing the semantic-motor gap, sample efficiency, generalization, multimodal fusion, and sim-to-real transfer)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated. The two-tiered architecture, problem formulation (POMDP, hierarchical decomposition), training methodology (self-supervision, pre-training, fine-tuning), multimodal fusion approach, and experimental design (benchmarks, baselines, metrics, ablations) are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. While minor details could be elaborated (e.g., specifics of pseudo-instruction generation), the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While leveraging existing concepts like MFMs and HRL, the specific combination and integration strategy are novel. Key innovative aspects include: 1) The synergistic architecture combining a *frozen* MFM for semantic guidance with a dedicated HRL controller for execution. 2) The use of the MFM itself to generate self-supervised pseudo-instructions and affordances to bootstrap the HRL policy learning, particularly the high-level policy. This differs from prior work like PaLM-E (end-to-end training) or standard HRL (often relying on intrinsic motivation or task rewards alone for hierarchy discovery). The novelty is clearly articulated and distinct from the cited literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (POMDPs, HRL) and utilizes well-established methods (MFMs, PPO/SAC, imitation learning, Transformer-based fusion). The proposed methodology, including the two-tiered architecture, the phased training approach (pre-training, fine-tuning), and the self-supervision mechanism, is technically robust and well-justified. The mathematical formulations (POMDP, objective function, losses) are standard and correctly presented. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablations to validate the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology (MFMs, simulators like Habitat, RL algorithms) and methods. However, it presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating MFMs with complex HRL frameworks requires substantial engineering effort. Training HRL agents, especially in complex 3D environments, is known to be sample-inefficient and requires careful tuning. The quality and utility of MFM-generated pseudo-instructions are uncertain and may require significant prompt engineering or model selection. Sim-to-real transfer (mentioned with a WidowX arm) adds another layer of complexity and risk. Access to significant computational resources is essential. While achievable in a research setting, it requires considerable expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: enabling embodied agents to leverage the semantic power of MFMs for complex, real-world tasks. Bridging the semantic-to-motor gap is crucial for advancing general-purpose robotics (e.g., home assistants, warehouse automation). If successful, the proposed framework could lead to substantial improvements in sample efficiency, task generalization, and the ability of robots to follow high-level instructions. The potential impact on both the MFM and embodied AI research communities is high, offering a blueprint for integrating these powerful technologies."
