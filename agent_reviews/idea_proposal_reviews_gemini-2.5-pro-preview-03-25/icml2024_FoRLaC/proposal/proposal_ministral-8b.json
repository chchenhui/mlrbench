    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the task description's focus on bridging RL and control theory for stability and robustness in high-stake systems. It directly addresses the research idea of integrating Lyapunov stability with RL through joint training and constrained optimization. The objectives and methodology are consistent with the idea and fit within the themes identified in the literature review (Lyapunov-based RL). A perfect score is withheld because the specific technical formulation of the loss functions seems potentially inconsistent with rigorous Lyapunov stability criteria, slightly undermining the alignment with the goal of providing formal guarantees."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal's overall goal, motivation, and structure are clear and easy to follow. The research objectives and experimental plan are well-defined. However, the clarity suffers in the core algorithmic details. The policy optimization loss function's connection to enforcing Lyapunov decrease isn't explicitly justified, and the Lyapunov function training loss seems conceptually incorrect for learning a valid Lyapunov function (its goal appears to be making V constant, not ensuring positive definiteness and decrease). The term V_bar is undefined. These ambiguities in the crucial technical sections prevent a higher score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The proposal lacks significant novelty. The core concept of combining Lyapunov functions with RL using neural networks and constrained optimization to ensure stability is a well-established research direction, as evidenced by the provided literature review which lists numerous recent papers (2023-2025) exploring very similar ideas (e.g., Neural Lyapunov Functions, SAC-CLF, model-based approaches, constrained policy optimization). The proposal does not articulate a unique methodological contribution, theoretical insight, or specific application focus that clearly distinguishes it from this existing body of work. It largely describes a known approach rather than proposing a new one."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal's soundness is questionable due to issues in the technical formulation. While the high-level idea of using Lyapunov functions in RL is sound, the specific implementation details are problematic. The policy optimization loss L(theta) = E[R - lambda * V(s_t+1)] does not directly enforce the Lyapunov decrease condition (V(s_t+1) < V(s_t)). More critically, the Lyapunov function training loss L(phi) = E[(V(s_t) - V_bar)^2] appears fundamentally flawed for learning a function that satisfies Lyapunov stability criteria (positive definiteness and negative definiteness of its derivative/difference). This objective seems unrelated to ensuring stability and suggests a misunderstanding of Lyapunov theory, significantly weakening the claim of achieving 'provably stable' policies."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally feasible. The required components – neural networks, RL algorithms (policy gradients), simulation environments (standard control benchmarks) – are standard and readily available. Joint training paradigms are common in deep RL. The experimental plan involving simulation and comparison with baselines is practical. The main feasibility risk stems from the potential need to significantly revise the core algorithm due to the soundness issues identified. However, assuming a corrected and sound formulation is used, the research plan is implementable with standard resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research addresses a significant problem: enhancing the safety and reliability of RL for deployment in critical control systems by incorporating stability guarantees. Successfully achieving this goal would have considerable impact, as highlighted in the proposal and the task description. However, the significance score is moderated because the proposed approach lacks novelty and appears technically flawed in its current description. Therefore, while the problem area is highly significant, the potential contribution of *this specific proposal*, as written, is limited unless the methodological issues are resolved and a novel angle is introduced."
