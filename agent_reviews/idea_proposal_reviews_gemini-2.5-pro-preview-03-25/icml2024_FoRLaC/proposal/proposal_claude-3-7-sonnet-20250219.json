        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging RL and control theory by focusing on stability and robustness guarantees, which are key topics mentioned. The proposal meticulously follows the research idea of integrating Lyapunov stability into RL via joint learning. It also situates itself well within the context of the provided literature review, acknowledging the active research area while proposing a specific framework (LGRL) and algorithm (LGPO) that builds upon recent work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure, starting with motivation and objectives, detailing the methodology with mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps, and outlining expected outcomes and impact. Key concepts like Lyapunov functions, joint optimization, and the LGPO algorithm are explained well. The experimental design is also clearly specified. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise sampling strategy for Lyapunov updates or the exact policy gradient variant, but these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The literature review clearly indicates that integrating Lyapunov functions with RL for stability and safety is a very active field with numerous recent contributions exploring similar concepts (joint learning, constrained optimization, robustness). The core idea is therefore not groundbreaking. However, the proposal offers novelty in the specific combination of techniques: the particular Lagrangian formulation for joint optimization, the specific neural network structure proposed for the Lyapunov function (V_\\\\phi(x) = \\\\|x\\\\|^2 + g_\\\\phi(x)^2), and the explicit integration of adversarial robustness analysis (approximated via Taylor expansion) directly into the Lyapunov constraint. It represents a thoughtful synthesis and refinement within an established research direction."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established Lyapunov stability theory and reinforcement learning principles. The mathematical formulation of the problem, the Lyapunov conditions, and the Lagrangian approach for constrained optimization are appropriate. The proposed algorithm (LGPO) follows logically from the formulation. However, there are minor gaps: 1) Relying on sampling (\\\\\\mathbb{E}_{x \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{D}}) to enforce the Lyapunov constraint doesn't guarantee it holds universally, which is crucial for formal guarantees. 2) The robustness analysis relies on a first-order Taylor approximation, whose accuracy can be limited. 3) Convergence properties of the proposed min-max-min optimization are not discussed. These points slightly reduce the overall rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required components (neural networks, policy gradient algorithms, simulation environments) are standard in ML research. Implementing the joint optimization, Lyapunov loss, and Lagrangian updates is complex but achievable with typical research resources. The experimental plan uses standard benchmarks. Potential challenges include extensive hyperparameter tuning (common in RL and constrained optimization) and verifying the learned Lyapunov function's validity across the state space, but these appear manageable within a research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck hindering the adoption of RL in safety-critical applications â€“ the lack of formal stability and robustness guarantees. Successfully developing the proposed LGRL framework could enable the deployment of RL in domains like autonomous driving, robotics, and industrial automation, representing a major advancement. It directly contributes to the workshop's theme of bridging RL and control theory and has the potential for substantial theoretical and practical impact."
