        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core goal of reinforcing the connection between reinforcement learning and control theory. It focuses explicitly on integrating control-theoretic concepts (Lyapunov stability, robustness guarantees) into RL algorithms (policy gradients), which aligns perfectly with the listed topics like 'Performance measures and guarantees (Stability, robustness)', 'Fundamental assumptions (stability)', and bridging theory (Lyapunov analysis) with applications (autonomous vehicles, industrial automation)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation is explicitly stated, the core concept ('Robust Policy Gradient Methods' integrating Lyapunov stability constraints) is clearly articulated, and the proposed two-step implementation process is outlined. The target domain and the intended contribution (bridging guarantees and flexibility) are unambiguous. Minor details regarding the specific algorithms for learning Lyapunov functions or solving the constrained optimization are not fully specified, but this is expected for a research idea summary."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea has notable originality. While research on safe RL and combining RL with control concepts (like Lyapunov stability or Control Barrier Functions) exists, the specific proposal of integrating learned Lyapunov functions as constraints directly within a policy gradient framework ('Robust Policy Gradient Methods') offers a potentially fresh perspective and implementation strategy. It builds upon existing trends but proposes a specific, coherent framework rather than just incremental improvements or replicating known methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Learning accurate and verifiable Lyapunov functions from data, especially for high-dimensional nonlinear systems common in deep RL, is notoriously difficult. Ensuring these learned functions provide meaningful stability guarantees is non-trivial. Furthermore, solving policy gradient optimization subject to potentially complex, state-dependent constraints derived from these learned functions can be computationally expensive and may face convergence issues. Significant research effort and potentially strong assumptions or approximations might be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Providing formal stability and robustness guarantees for deep RL policies is a critical bottleneck hindering their deployment in safety-critical, high-stakes applications (like autonomous systems and industrial control), which are explicitly mentioned as target areas in the task description. Successfully bridging the gap between data-driven RL flexibility and control-theoretic rigor would represent a major advancement in making RL more reliable and trustworthy for real-world problems."
