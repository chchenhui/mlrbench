        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for contributions connecting reinforcement learning and control theory, focusing on fundamental aspects like stability and robustness guarantees, which are the core elements of this idea. It directly addresses listed topics such as 'Performance measures and guarantees: Stability, robustness', 'Fundamental assumptions: non-linear systems, stability', 'Computational aspects: Efficient algorithms', 'Models: nonlinear control', and 'Target applications: autonomous vehicles, robots, industrial processes'. The idea's goal of bridging control theory's stability frameworks with RL's adaptability perfectly matches the workshop's aim to 'reinforce the connection between reinforcement learning and control theory' and foster 'new perspectives'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (lack of stability guarantees in RL), the main technical approach (jointly training policy and Lyapunov networks via constrained optimization), the expected outcomes (provably stable policies), and the potential impact are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The methodology involving Lyapunov conditions as constraints is specific and understandable. It clearly outlines what the research intends to achieve and how."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While the high-level concept of integrating Lyapunov stability with RL is an active and recognized research area (not entirely groundbreaking), the proposal suggests a specific approach (joint training, constrained optimization). Significant research exists on control-theoretic RL and learning Lyapunov functions. The novelty would likely lie in the specific architectural choices, the formulation of the constrained optimization problem, the theoretical analysis of the resulting stability guarantees for the learned components, or the specific application domains and empirical results. It's innovative compared to standard RL but builds upon existing directions within the RL+Control community."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents challenges. Neural networks can approximate complex functions, including policies and Lyapunov candidates. Constrained optimization techniques for RL are available. Standard control benchmarks exist for validation. However, learning a valid Lyapunov function that guarantees stability across a significant portion of the state space, especially for complex nonlinear systems, is notoriously difficult. Ensuring the learned function satisfies the Lyapunov decrease condition robustly during and after training is a major challenge. While feasible as a research project, achieving strong, provable guarantees might require simplifying assumptions or yield local stability results. The practical implementation and training stability could require significant effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the lack of formal stability and safety guarantees is one of the most critical barriers to deploying RL in real-world, high-stakes applications like autonomous systems and industrial automation. Successfully developing methods that provide such guarantees, even under certain assumptions, would be a major advancement. It directly tackles a fundamental limitation of current RL methods and could significantly increase trust and adoption of RL in safety-critical domains, aligning perfectly with the potential impact described."
