    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the research idea of a neuro-symbolic architecture for tool synthesis. It fits well within the workshop's scope ('Frontiers of AGI research' like tool-augmented LLMs, 'Classic AGI Attempts' like symbolic AI, and 'Fundamental Limitations of LLMs' like reasoning and adaptability). The methodology incorporates concepts (neuro-symbolic integration, ILP, program synthesis) and acknowledges challenges highlighted in the literature review."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (including the three stages, specific techniques like ILP/Sketch, and algorithmic workflow), and experimental design are well-defined. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for the LLM generating reliable formal specifications or examples for the symbolic engine, but overall clarity is high."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While components like neuro-symbolic AI, LLM tool use, ILP, and program synthesis exist, their integration into a framework where an LLM identifies functional gaps and directs a symbolic engine to synthesize *new* tools on-the-fly appears novel. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work (like Toolformer relying on existing tools) cited implicitly and explicitly. The specific architecture combining LLM specification with symbolic synthesis/verification for dynamic tool repertoire expansion is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established theoretical foundations (LLMs, symbolic reasoning, ILP, program synthesis, formal verification). The proposed methodology using LLMs for specification and symbolic engines (ILP/Sketch/SyGuS) for synthesis, coupled with verification (Z3), is logical. However, the critical step of reliably translating LLM intent into correct formal specifications or generating effective examples (E^+/E^-) for the symbolic engine lacks detailed justification on how potential challenges will be overcome. The inclusion of PPO for refining tool usage adds complexity but is plausible."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the core technologies exist, integrating the LLM and symbolic components seamlessly, ensuring the LLM generates usable specifications, and scaling the symbolic synthesis (ILP/program synthesis can be computationally expensive) are substantial hurdles. The experimental plan is reasonable, but achieving robust performance, especially on complex real-world tasks and demonstrating significant generalization, requires considerable effort and potentially further technical breakthroughs. The overall system complexity poses a risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current LLMs – their static toolkits – which is a major barrier to achieving greater adaptability and autonomy, key aspects of AGI. Enabling dynamic tool synthesis could lead to major advancements in LLM problem-solving capabilities. Success would have substantial implications for AI research and high-impact applications in science, robotics, and autonomous systems."
