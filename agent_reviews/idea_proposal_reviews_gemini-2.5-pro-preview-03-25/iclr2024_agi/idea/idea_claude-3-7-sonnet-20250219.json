    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses Topic 1 ('Frontiers of AGI research', specifically 'AI agents' and 'multi-agent AI'). It also implicitly tackles Topic 4 ('Fundamental Limitations of LLMs') by proposing a method to overcome reasoning deficits, a key limitation discussed. The focus on advanced reasoning capabilities is central to the 'How Far Are We From AGI' theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (specialized agents, dynamic allocation, deliberation, meta-learning, orchestrator), and overall goal are understandable. However, the specifics of how these components interact, particularly the deliberation process and the meta-learning mechanism, lack detail, leaving some ambiguity about the precise implementation. Minor refinements regarding the operational mechanics would improve clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While multi-agent systems and specialized agents are established concepts, the proposed framework integrates dynamic agent allocation, a structured deliberative process involving critique and refinement, and meta-learning specifically to enhance complex reasoning in AI for AGI-level tasks. This specific combination and application, focusing on diverse reasoning types and knowledge domains coordinated for advanced reasoning, offers a fresh perspective compared to standard multi-agent approaches or single large models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building and coordinating a diverse set of specialized agents, designing effective dynamic allocation and deliberation protocols, and implementing a stable meta-learning layer for collaborative dynamics are complex engineering and research tasks. While the individual components draw on existing techniques (MAS, RL, meta-learning), integrating them into a robust, scalable system requires considerable effort, resources, and potentially further research breakthroughs in agent coordination and communication."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the complex reasoning limitations of current AI models is a critical bottleneck on the path toward AGI. Developing systems that can integrate multiple perspectives and specialized knowledge domains to solve complex problems could lead to major advancements. Success in this area would represent a substantial step forward in AI capabilities, potentially enabling breakthroughs in science, decision-making, and other complex fields, directly contributing to the AGI discussion."
