        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses Topic 1 ('Frontiers of AGI research', specifically 'knowledge-enhanced AI') and Topic 4 ('Fundamental Limitations of LLMs', specifically 'reasoning, planning'). The motivation explicitly links the work to overcoming LLM limitations for AGI, fitting the workshop's central theme 'How Far Are We From AGI'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main idea, and the 5-step methodology are presented logically. The concept of integrating hierarchical knowledge graphs to enhance reasoning is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific graph embedding techniques or the exact hybrid architecture, but the overall research direction is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. Integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs is an established research direction (Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs). The specific focus on *hierarchical* KGs and their explicit use for multi-step *reasoning and planning* offers some novelty compared to KG use for simple fact retrieval. However, it builds heavily on existing concepts rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Techniques for KG construction, graph embedding, hybrid model design, and LLM fine-tuning exist. However, constructing large-scale, high-quality hierarchical KGs is challenging and resource-intensive. Training complex hybrid models also requires significant computational resources and expertise. While challenging, it is implementable within the scope of current ML research capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Enhancing the reasoning and planning capabilities of LLMs is crucial for progress towards AGI and addresses a widely recognized limitation. Success in this area could lead to more capable AI systems for complex problem-solving, planning, and understanding, representing a meaningful contribution to the field."
