    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key workshop themes like UI generation, RLHF, personalization, and human evaluation. It elaborates comprehensively on the research idea of adaptive UI generation via feedback. Crucially, it accurately summarizes the cited literature (Gaspar-Figueiredo's work on UI *adaptation*) and clearly articulates the research gap it aims to fill (moving from adaptation to *generation*, integrating implicit/explicit feedback for generation). All sections, from objectives to methodology and significance, consistently build upon this foundation."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, making it easy to follow. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the proposed architecture, data collection, individual components (preference learning, generative model, RL agent), and the experimental plan. The RL formulation (state, action, reward) is conceptually outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for weighting implicit vs. explicit feedback or the exact mapping of RL actions to generative model controls, but these are acceptable at the proposal stage and do not significantly obscure the core concepts."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using existing techniques like RL, generative models, and feedback mechanisms, its core contribution lies in integrating these for *adaptive UI generation* based on continuous, dual-source user feedback (implicit and explicit). This contrasts with the cited literature focusing primarily on *adapting* existing UIs. Applying RLHF concepts, largely developed in NLP, to the structured domain of UI generation, particularly incorporating continuous implicit signals alongside explicit feedback into the generative loop, represents a fresh perspective and a significant extension of prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established RL, generative modeling, and HCI principles. The proposed methodology, including the POMDP formulation for RL, the consideration of suitable generative model architectures (Transformers, VAEs), and the detailed experimental design with baselines and standard evaluation metrics (SUS, TLX, performance), is technically robust. The reward function formulation is conceptually sound. While acknowledging significant inherent challenges (e.g., complex state/action spaces, preference modeling from noisy data, credit assignment), the proposed approach is coherent and technically well-justified for tackling the problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Integrating the complex components (RL agent, generative model, preference module, interaction environment) and effectively training the RL agent, especially with real user data, will require significant expertise in multiple domains (ML, HCI, software engineering) and substantial effort. Data collection through user studies is standard but time-consuming. The plan is realistic in its phased approach (simulation then real users) and scope, but the technical complexity means successful execution requires careful planning, skilled researchers, and potentially iterative refinement. The risks associated with training stability and preference modeling accuracy are non-trivial."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical limitation of static, non-personalized UIs, a major challenge in HCI. Success would represent a substantial advancement towards truly user-adaptive interfaces, with high potential to improve user experience, productivity, and accessibility across various applications. The research contributes novel methods to AI (applying RLHF to UI generation, integrating diverse feedback) and HCI (adaptive systems, evaluation methods). The potential practical applications in UI design tools, personalized software, and accessibility are clear and substantial."
