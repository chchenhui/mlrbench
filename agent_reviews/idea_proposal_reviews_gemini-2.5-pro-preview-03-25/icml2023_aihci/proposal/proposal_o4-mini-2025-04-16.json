    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key topics from the workshop call (UI generation, RLHF, personalization, human evaluation, HITL, tools/datasets). It elaborates comprehensively on the core research idea of adaptive UI generation via RL and user feedback. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (especially Gaspar-Figueiredo et al. on RL for adaptive UIs and general RLHF concepts), positioning the work within the current research landscape and aiming to tackle identified challenges like integrating feedback types and personalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. It presents a logical structure with distinct sections for introduction, objectives, methodology, evaluation, and impact. The research objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology breaks down the approach into understandable components (Data Collection, Preference Learning, RL Adaptation). Key concepts like the reward function, state/action representation, and learning algorithm (PPO) are defined, including mathematical formulations. The evaluation plan is detailed. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise architecture of the generative model and policy network, the exact feature engineering process for the reward model, and the specifics of the action space ('high-level macro actions'), but the overall plan and rationale are readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing work in RL for adaptive UIs (Gaspar-Figueiredo et al.) and RLHF, it introduces several novel elements. The primary novelty lies in the proposed integration: a unified *online* framework for continuous adaptation, a specific Bayesian approach to model user preference posteriors for personalization, and using this posterior uncertainty to drive exploration via Thompson sampling. This combination, particularly the Bayesian personalization guiding exploration, appears distinct from the cited works which focus more on per-user agents or comparing reward sources. The emphasis on integrating implicit/explicit signals within this specific Bayesian RL framework also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established methodologies like RL (PPO, GAE), Bayesian inference, and standard HCI evaluation techniques (SUS, NASA-TLX, controlled studies). The proposed composite reward function incorporating implicit/explicit feedback and a novelty penalty is well-reasoned, although its empirical effectiveness requires validation (which is planned). The use of Bayesian posteriors for personalization and Thompson sampling for exploration is theoretically well-founded. The evaluation plan is rigorous, including both lab and field studies with appropriate metrics and statistical analysis. Minor points like the Gaussian reward assumption could be further justified, but the overall technical approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating a generative UI model, real-time interaction logging, Bayesian preference updates, and an online RL agent into a cohesive, responsive system is technically complex. Building a reliable simulation environment is non-trivial. Conducting the planned user studies (especially the 2-week field study) requires substantial resources and logistical planning. While the individual components rely on existing technologies, their seamless integration and tuning for real-time performance pose considerable risks. Success depends heavily on strong engineering execution and potentially iterative refinement. The ambition level makes it challenging but not impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of creating truly personalized and adaptive user interfaces, a long-standing goal in HCI with potential benefits for usability, accessibility, and user engagement. By proposing a novel integration of modern RLHF techniques with HCI principles for continuous online adaptation, it has the potential to make major advancements at the intersection of AI and HCI. The planned release of an open-source toolkit and dataset would be a substantial contribution to the research community, aligning well with the workshop's goals. Success could influence both academic research and industrial practices in UI design."
