    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on AI/HCI intersection, specifically UI generation, RLHF, personalization, and human evaluation. It systematically elaborates on the core research idea of adaptive UI generation via preference learning. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (Gaspar-Figueiredo et al., RLHF concepts), positioning itself as a next step and addressing identified challenges like feedback integration and evaluation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to detailed methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. Research objectives are specific and measurable. The framework components, data collection procedures, algorithmic choices (PPO, Transformers, pairwise ranking), and evaluation metrics are articulated precisely, including mathematical formulations where appropriate. There is minimal ambiguity, making the research plan readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality by proposing the integration of RLHF, primarily explored in NLP, into the domain of dynamic and generative UI adaptation. While RL for UI adaptation exists (as per the literature review), the specific combination with RLHF for reward modeling based on explicit user rankings, coupled with a Transformer-based generative model conditioned on learned preferences, represents a novel approach in this area. The multi-modal feedback fusion and contextual exploration strategies further contribute to its innovation beyond incremental improvements."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on solid theoretical foundations, leveraging well-established techniques like PPO for RL, pairwise comparison for RLHF reward modeling, Transformers for generation, and standard HCI evaluation metrics (SUS, NASA-TLX). The methodology is rigorous, outlining clear steps for data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Technical formulations are provided and appear correct. The inclusion of baselines and ablation studies strengthens the experimental design. Minor areas like the specific state/action space definition and the fixed weighting in the reward signal might require further empirical justification, but the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. The required technologies (RL frameworks, Transformer models, web development for UI testing) are available. Generating synthetic data and implementing the models are achievable. However, collecting data from 500 participants requires significant logistical effort and resources. Training complex RL agents with learned reward models and integrating them with a generative UI model can be challenging and computationally intensive, potentially requiring substantial tuning. While feasible with adequate resources and expertise, the scope presents moderate implementation risks and challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in HCI: creating truly personalized and adaptive user interfaces that evolve with user needs and preferences. Success would represent a major advancement over static or rule-based adaptive systems. The potential impact is substantial, including enhanced usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction across various applications. The expected contributions (novel framework, open-source dataset/benchmarks, design guidelines) would be valuable to both the AI and HCI research communities."
