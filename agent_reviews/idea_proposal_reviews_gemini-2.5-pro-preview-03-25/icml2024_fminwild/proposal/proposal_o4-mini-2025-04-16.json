    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of hallucination and reliability in FMs deployed 'in the wild,' as highlighted in the workshop task description. The proposed multi-level contrastive learning approach perfectly matches the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself clearly against existing methods (RAG, post-hoc detection, other CL approaches like Iter-AHMCL and Jiang et al.) and addressing key challenges identified in the review, such as mitigation during training and knowledge integration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, motivation, and research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the data collection, model architecture, the three distinct contrastive loss functions (with mathematical formulations), the joint training objective, and the algorithmic steps. The experimental design is thorough, outlining datasets, baselines, metrics, ablations, and human evaluation. The structure is logical, making it easy to follow the proposed research plan. Minor details like negative sampling strategies could be elaborated, but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While RAG and contrastive learning for hallucination reduction are existing concepts (as shown in the literature review, e.g., Jiang et al., Iter-AHMCL, BÃ©chard & Ayala), the specific combination of *three distinct levels* of contrastive learning (token, statement, and source-reliability) integrated within a RAG framework during fine-tuning appears novel. Particularly, the source-reliability loss, directly contrasting output embeddings with evidence embeddings, offers a fresh perspective on enforcing factual grounding. The novelty lies in the integrated, multi-granularity approach aimed at *preventing* hallucinations during training, rather than solely detecting or correcting them post-hoc or using simpler CL schemes."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in transformer models, retrieval-augmented generation, and contrastive learning (InfoNCE, margin loss). The rationale for each contrastive level (token discrimination, statement veracity, source alignment) is logical and well-justified. The methodology is detailed, technically correct (equations appear standard and appropriate), and includes a comprehensive experimental plan with relevant baselines (including recent work from the lit review), diverse datasets, multiple evaluation metrics, ablation studies, and human evaluation. The approach is methodologically robust."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. It relies on existing technologies (FMs, RAG, CL) and standard ML infrastructure. However, constructing the multi-domain hallucination dataset with high-quality (x, y^+, y^-) pairs, especially plausible-but-false y^-, could be labor-intensive and requires careful design, although leveraging existing benchmarks and synthetic data mitigates this. Fine-tuning large FMs with multiple complex loss terms will be computationally expensive and require careful hyperparameter tuning (\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta, \\tau, \\Delta). While challenging, these aspects are within the scope of typical ML research projects and do not represent fundamental roadblocks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and pressing problem: hallucination in foundation models, which is a major barrier to their reliable deployment in critical real-world applications (healthcare, finance, legal), directly aligning with the workshop's focus. Successfully reducing hallucinations fundamentally during training, rather than relying solely on post-hoc fixes, would be a major contribution to AI safety and trustworthiness. The potential impact on improving FM reliability and enabling safer deployment is substantial. The research directly tackles core issues of reliability and responsibility outlined in the task description."
