    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of FM reliability and hallucination highlighted in the workshop task description. The methodology is a direct and detailed expansion of the multi-level contrastive learning concept outlined in the research idea. Furthermore, it effectively situates the proposed work within the context of recent research (Iter-AHMCL, ReDeEP, RAG-HAT, etc.) cited in the literature review, clearly identifying the gap (lack of multi-level CL for hallucination) it aims to fill. It incorporates relevant benchmarks (Bi'an, ReEval) and addresses key challenges mentioned in the literature review, such as integrating external knowledge (via RAG) and developing better mitigation strategies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives (token, statement, source-reliability levels), and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of data collection, the multi-level framework with specific loss functions, RAG integration, and a comprehensive experimental design including baselines, metrics, and domains. The structure is logical and easy to follow. While the exact mechanism for generating hallucinated data or the specifics of the RAG revision process could be slightly more detailed, these are minor points that do not detract significantly from the overall clarity. The technical formulations are presented clearly."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While contrastive learning and RAG are established techniques, and prior work has applied CL to hallucination (e.g., Iter-AHMCL, Hallucination Augmented CL), the proposed *multi-level* approach (simultaneously targeting token, statement, and source-reliability levels) combined specifically for hallucination reduction appears novel. The source-reliability contrastive loss, designed to explicitly train preference for retrieved evidence over parametric knowledge, is a distinct contribution. The proposal clearly differentiates its approach from existing single-level or model-level CL methods cited in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, RAG) and cites relevant, recent literature. The proposed methodology, including the specific loss functions (NT-Xent, pairwise contrastive, margin loss) for each level, is technically well-defined. The experimental design is robust, featuring strong baselines, appropriate metrics, and relevant domain-specific evaluations. Minor points requiring further clarification or validation include the precise operationalization of confidence scores (s_{\\text{parametric}}, s_{\\text{retrieval}}) for the source-reliability loss and the empirical challenge of effectively balancing the three loss components (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3). However, the overall approach is methodologically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The required resources (annotated data, especially domain-specific; compute power for FM training/tuning; domain expertise) are significant but standard for FM research. The core technologies (CL, RAG, FMs) are available. However, creating the high-quality hybrid dataset with reliable annotations will be time-consuming. Tuning the three interacting contrastive losses (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3) might be complex and require extensive experimentation. Achieving the target inference latency (<500ms) while performing RAG retrieval and reliability scoring might require significant optimization efforts. The claim about edge deployment seems optimistic given the complexity and needs more justification."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses FM hallucination, a critical bottleneck for reliable real-world deployment, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, directly aligning with the workshop's focus. Successfully reducing hallucination rates (targeting 10-20% reduction) would represent a major advancement, enhancing trust and enabling safer AI adoption. The potential contributions include a novel multi-level mitigation framework, insights into hallucination mechanisms across different granularities, and potentially a valuable benchmark dataset. The research has clear potential for substantial impact on the field."
