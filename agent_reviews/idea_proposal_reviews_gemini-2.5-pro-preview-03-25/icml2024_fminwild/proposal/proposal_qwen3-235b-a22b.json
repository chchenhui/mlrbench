    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of reliability (specifically hallucination), adaptivity, and efficiency in foundation models deployed 'in the wild'. The methodology section meticulously elaborates on the multi-level contrastive learning idea outlined in the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning its multi-level approach as a novel extension to existing contrastive learning (Iter-AHMCL, HACL) and RAG-based hallucination mitigation techniques (ReDeEP, REFIND, RAG-HAT), clearly articulating its relationship to prior work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The introduction sets the context effectively, the methodology details the three levels of contrastive learning with corresponding loss functions, and the expected outcomes and impact are well-explained. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanism for integrating the three contrastive losses (e.g., weighting, joint optimization), the exact nature and creation process of the 'specialized hallucination detection dataset' (used for detection or training contrastive pairs?), and the specifics of how RAG integrates *during* the contrastive training phases. However, these points do not significantly obscure the core concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While contrastive learning and RAG are established techniques for addressing hallucinations (as shown in the literature review), the core novelty lies in the proposed *multi-level* structure (token, statement, source-reliability) applied *during* training/fine-tuning as a preventative measure. This specific combination and hierarchical application, particularly the source-reliability contrastive learning component, offers a fresh perspective compared to existing single-level or post-hoc approaches. It represents a significant conceptual step beyond simply applying existing methods individually."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, grounded in established principles of contrastive learning and retrieval-augmented generation. The rationale for each level of the framework is logical, and the use of standard loss functions (InfoNCE, Hinge Loss) is appropriate. The proposal correctly identifies relevant prior work. However, some aspects lack full justification or detail: the assumption that a high-quality, large-scale dataset with factual/hallucinated pairs *and* reliable source provenance can be readily curated is strong; the potential complexities and interactions arising from optimizing three different contrastive objectives simultaneously are not discussed; and the technical details of integrating RAG within the contrastive training loop require further elaboration. The provided loss functions are standard but their specific adaptation and interplay in this multi-level context could be more detailed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the underlying technologies (LLMs, contrastive learning, RAG) exist, curating the required multi-faceted dataset (factual/hallucinated pairs with source provenance) at scale is a major undertaking and potential bottleneck. Training such a complex model, integrating three contrastive losses potentially with a standard LM objective and RAG, will be computationally very expensive and likely difficult to tune for stability and optimal performance. Success depends heavily on access to substantial compute resources and expertise in both large model training and dataset engineering. The risks associated with dataset quality and training complexity are considerable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical problem of hallucinations in foundation models, a major barrier to their trustworthy deployment in high-stakes, real-world applications (healthcare, finance, legal), directly aligning with the workshop's central theme. Successfully reducing hallucinations during training, rather than relying solely on post-hoc detection, would represent a major advancement in AI reliability and responsibility. The potential impact on enabling safer and more dependable AI systems in critical sectors is substantial."
