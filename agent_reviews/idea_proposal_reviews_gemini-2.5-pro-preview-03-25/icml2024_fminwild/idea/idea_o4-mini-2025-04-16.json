        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses multiple core themes: 'Reliability and Responsibility' (tackling hallucination, ensuring reliability outside training distribution via KG grounding), 'Real-world Adaptation' (specifically adapting FMs for the clinical health domain), and 'Practical Limitations' (aiming for sub-second response times and providing provenance/traceability). The focus on making FMs safer and more reliable for deployment in a high-stakes environment like healthcare fits squarely within the workshop's goal of exploring FMs 'in the wild'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (FM limitations in healthcare), the proposed solution (dynamic KG grounding via GNNs and attention biases), the methodology (two-stage fine-tuning: supervised RAG + RLHF), and the expected outcomes (reduced errors, low latency, provenance) with specific benchmarks (MedQA, emrQA). The components and their interactions are explained concisely, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While individual components like RAG, KG grounding, GNNs, and RLHF exist, the specific combination proposed is innovative. Using a GNN to dynamically identify relevant KG subgraphs at inference time and encoding this structured knowledge as attention biases for an FM in the clinical domain offers a fresh perspective. The dynamic and continually updated nature of the KG adds another layer of novelty compared to static RAG approaches. It's a novel synthesis and application of existing techniques rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Access to pre-trained FMs and GNN frameworks is readily available. However, constructing, maintaining, and *continually updating* a comprehensive clinical KG is a significant undertaking requiring substantial domain expertise and resources. Fine-tuning large models (FM + GNN) and implementing RLHF also demand considerable computational power and careful experimental design. Integrating the GNN output efficiently as attention biases might require specific model architecture considerations. Achieving sub-second latency for the entire pipeline (query -> KG retrieval -> GNN -> FM generation) will require significant optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of FMs in clinical settings is a critical challenge. Hallucinations or incorrect information from AI in healthcare can have severe consequences. By proposing a method to ground FMs in verified knowledge, reduce errors, and provide provenance, this research could lead to major advancements in developing deployable and trustworthy clinical decision support systems, potentially improving patient care and clinician confidence in AI tools."
