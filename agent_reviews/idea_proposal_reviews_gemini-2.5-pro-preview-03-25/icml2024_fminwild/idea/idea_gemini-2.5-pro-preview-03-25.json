        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on 'Foundation Models in the Wild', and one of its key themes (Question 4) explicitly addresses 'Practical Limitations in Deployment', including 'system constraints, computational costs, data acquisition barriers, response time demands'. The proposed idea directly tackles computational costs and response times by suggesting a context-adaptive parameter allocation method to improve efficiency based on input complexity and system constraints. This directly addresses the core challenges mentioned in the workshop description for deploying FMs in real-world scenarios."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (high cost/latency of FMs, limitations of static methods) is clearly stated. The main concept (dynamic, context-aware parameter subset activation) is well-defined. The proposed mechanism (lightweight gating based on query and system constraints) and the target components (layers, heads, experts) are specified. The expected outcomes (reduced FLOPs/latency, adaptability) are also clearly articulated. The idea is concise and easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While concepts like conditional computation (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts) and dynamic network pruning/early exiting exist, this proposal integrates input context *and* system constraints (latency budget, memory) into a unified gating mechanism for selecting diverse components (not just experts, but potentially layers/heads). This explicit consideration of real-time system constraints for dynamic parameter allocation adds a novel dimension compared to typical input-dependent conditional computation or static pruning methods. It's an innovative combination and refinement of existing ideas tailored for resource-aware deployment."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Designing and training an effective, low-overhead gating mechanism is crucial and non-trivial; it must be fast enough not to counteract the efficiency gains. Integrating this dynamic routing into existing complex FM architectures and inference frameworks requires significant engineering effort. Ensuring performance (accuracy) is maintained across different activated subsets and managing the trade-off between efficiency and quality will require careful tuning and validation. However, the underlying concepts (gating, conditional computation) are established in ML, making the approach plausible with sufficient effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. The computational cost and latency of large FMs are major barriers to their widespread deployment 'in the wild', particularly on edge devices or in interactive applications. An effective method for dynamically adapting resource usage based on context and constraints could drastically improve the practicality and economic viability of using FMs. Success in this area would represent a major advancement in efficient AI deployment, directly impacting how FMs are integrated into society and various applications, aligning perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on real-world utility."
