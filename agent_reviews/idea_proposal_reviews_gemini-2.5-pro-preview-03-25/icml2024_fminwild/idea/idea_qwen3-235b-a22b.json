        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Foundation Models in the Wild' and specifically targets 'Practical Limitations in Deployment' (Question 4), focusing on system constraints (edge devices), computational costs, and response time demands. The emphasis on efficiency and adaptivity for real-world scenarios is central to the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (FM limitations on edge), the proposed solution (EfficientEdge framework), its core components (compression, early stopping, RL controller), the mechanism (dynamic adaptation based on resources/context), target metrics (latency/energy reduction, accuracy), and potential applications. The connection to the workshop's specific question (Q4) is explicitly stated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like model compression, early stopping, and RL for optimization exist, the proposed integration into a cohesive framework ('EfficientEdge') that *dynamically* adapts FM inference on edge devices based on *real-time* resource availability and input context using an RL meta-controller offers a fresh perspective. The novelty lies in the specific combination, application to FMs on edge, and the adaptive control mechanism."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The underlying techniques (quantization, pruning, early stopping, RL) are established. However, integrating them seamlessly, training an effective RL meta-controller for real-time, multi-objective optimization (accuracy, latency, energy) across diverse inputs and device states presents moderate implementation challenges. Achieving the ambitious 50% reduction targets while maintaining 95%+ accuracy across various FMs and tasks might require significant tuning and experimentation, but the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Enabling efficient FM inference on resource-constrained edge devices addresses a critical bottleneck hindering their widespread real-world deployment ('in the wild'). Success would democratize access to advanced AI capabilities in crucial areas like mobile health, offline education, agriculture, and disaster response, particularly in low-resource settings. It directly tackles a major practical challenge highlighted by the workshop."
