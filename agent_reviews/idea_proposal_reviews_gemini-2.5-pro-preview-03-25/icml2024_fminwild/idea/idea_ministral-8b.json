    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme of 'Foundation Models in the Wild'. It directly addresses the first fundamental question regarding 'Real-world Adaptation' by proposing a framework to adapt FMs for specific domains like drug discovery, education, and clinical health. It also touches upon the second question ('Reliability and Responsibility') by aiming to reduce hallucination and bias, and the third question ('Safety, Ethics, and Fairness') by considering responsible deployment. However, it doesn't explicitly detail how it tackles the fourth question concerning 'Practical Limitations' like computational costs or system constraints, although adaptive inference might implicitly relate to efficiency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The overall goal and motivation are clear. The proposed methodology is broken down into three steps. However, the description lacks specific technical details, particularly regarding the 'Adaptive Inference' mechanism. It's unclear how model parameters would be adjusted based on 'real-time feedback' â€“ the nature of the feedback, the update mechanism, and the computational implications are not defined. 'Domain-Specific Pre-Training' is also slightly ambiguous, as the description mentions fine-tuning existing FMs, which is typically distinct from pre-training. More elaboration is needed for a complete understanding of the proposed technical approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea combines several techniques, but the individual components vary in novelty. Domain-specific fine-tuning (step 1) is a very common and established approach for adapting FMs. Continuous evaluation and iteration (step 3) are standard ML practices. The potential novelty lies mainly in the 'Adaptive Inference' component (step 2), which suggests dynamic adjustments during inference based on real-time feedback. Depending on the specific mechanism (which is undefined), this could range from moderately novel (e.g., dynamic prompt/adapter selection) to highly novel (e.g., efficient real-time parameter updates). As described, the overall novelty is satisfactory but not groundbreaking, heavily relying on the unspecified details of adaptive inference."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Domain-specific fine-tuning is feasible but requires substantial computational resources and access to high-quality, domain-specific datasets, which can be a barrier (related to workshop Q4). Evaluation and iteration are standard. The feasibility of 'Adaptive Inference' is uncertain due to the lack of detail. Real-time parameter adjustments during inference can be technically complex, computationally expensive, and potentially introduce latency issues, conflicting with practical deployment constraints (workshop Q4). Obtaining meaningful 'real-time feedback' in complex domains like healthcare also poses practical challenges. Overall, parts are feasible, but the core adaptive component's practicality is questionable without further specification."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant problem: improving the adaptability and reliability of foundation models for real-world, domain-specific applications. This directly aligns with the workshop's core focus. Successfully enhancing FM adaptability in critical sectors like healthcare and education would have a substantial positive impact, improving decision-making and outcomes. Reducing hallucination and bias through domain adaptation is also a critical research direction. The potential impact is high, contributing significantly to the practical and responsible deployment of FMs."
