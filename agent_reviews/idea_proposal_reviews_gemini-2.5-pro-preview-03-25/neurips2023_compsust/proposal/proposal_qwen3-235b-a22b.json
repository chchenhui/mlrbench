    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the CompSust-2023 workshop's themes of bridging the 'theory-to-deployment' gap, tackling 'promises and pitfalls' (data scarcity, bias, interpretability, real-time needs), focusing on SDGs, and fostering collaboration (NGO partnerships). It systematically elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the multimodal approach, ML techniques, community focus, and edge computing aspects. Furthermore, it explicitly addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review (data scarcity, interpretability, ethics, real-time processing, multimodal integration) and positions itself relative to cited works (e.g., mentioning DisasterNets as a baseline). The objectives and methodology directly reflect the requirements and context provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically. Key concepts like multimodal data fusion, transfer learning, interpretability methods (attention, uncertainty), edge computing, and community engagement are explained. Technical details like equations for normalization, Grad-CAM, MC dropout, adversarial loss, MAML, and pruning are included. However, some areas could benefit from minor refinement: the specifics of the GNN architecture for social media, the details of the 'late fusion' approach (referenced Fig. 1 is not provided), and slightly more context for some technical choices could enhance clarity further. Overall, it is highly understandable with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, primarily through the integration and application of existing techniques into a comprehensive framework tailored for a specific, challenging context. While individual components (multimodal fusion, transfer learning, interpretability, edge computing, community engagement) have been explored in the literature (as shown in the review), the novelty lies in their synergistic combination within a framework explicitly designed to bridge the theory-to-deployment gap for EWS in low-resource, climate-vulnerable regions. The specific hybrid architecture (CNN-BiLSTM + Transformer + GNN), the combined use of adversarial domain adaptation and MAML for data scarcity, the strong emphasis on community-centered design with feedback loops, and the commitment to producing an open-source toolkit and benchmark dataset contribute to its innovative character. It offers fresh perspectives on deploying ML for disaster response, distinguishing itself from prior work focusing on narrower aspects."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon established ML principles (deep learning architectures, transfer learning, interpretability methods) and references relevant literature. The methodology outlines appropriate techniques for data handling, modeling (CNN-BiLSTM for spatio-temporal satellite data, Transformers for sensor time-series, GNNs for social networks), transfer learning (adversarial loss, MAML), interpretability (Grad-CAM, MC Dropout), and edge deployment (pruning, TF Lite). Evaluation metrics are well-chosen (technical and deployment-focused). However, the soundness could be slightly improved by providing more justification for specific architectural choices (e.g., why late fusion?), discussing potential challenges in integrating and training the complex hybrid model, and elaborating on how potential data biases identified in the literature review will be specifically mitigated beyond participatory design. The technical formulations are present and appear correct but are concise."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The ambition is high: collecting diverse, reliable multimodal data (satellite, weather, IoT, social media, surveys) across three distinct, low-resource regions (Bangladesh, Nepal, Mozambique) requires substantial logistical coordination, strong sustained partnerships (NGOs, local governments), potential high costs (IoT deployment), and navigating ethical/data sharing agreements. Training the complex hybrid model and effectively implementing advanced transfer learning (MAML) requires significant technical expertise. Deploying and maintaining edge devices (Raspberry Pis) and ensuring meaningful community participation/feedback in these settings pose practical hurdles. While technically plausible with current tools, the sheer scope, reliance on external partners, and logistical complexity in resource-constrained environments make successful execution challenging within a typical project timeframe and budget. The target impact (e.g., 20% fatality reduction) is also very ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical global challenge of natural disasters exacerbated by climate change, focusing on highly vulnerable populations and directly contributing to multiple UN SDGs (1, 11, 13). By tackling the theory-to-deployment gap in ML for disaster response, it aligns perfectly with the core aims of Computational Sustainability and the specific themes of the CompSust-2023 workshop. The potential impact includes improved early warnings, reduced loss of life, enhanced community resilience, and potentially influencing policy (UN Global Assessment Report). The proposed contributions (integrated framework, open-source toolkit, benchmark dataset) could have a lasting effect on the field. The focus on low-resource settings, ethical considerations, and community integration further amplifies its importance."
