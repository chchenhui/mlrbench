    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the CompSust workshop's theme of 'Promises and Pitfalls from Theory to Deployment' by focusing on an ML-based Early Warning System (EWS) for disaster response. It incorporates key elements from the research idea, such as multimodal data integration, transfer learning for data scarcity, interpretability, edge computing, and community engagement. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (e.g., WaveCastNet, SENSE, DisasterNets for ML models; Soden et al. for ethics) and tackles the key challenges identified in the review (data scarcity, interpretability, ethics, real-time processing, multimodal integration). The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes consistently reflect the goal of bridging the gap between ML theory and practical, sustainable deployment in disaster management."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology, evaluation, and impact. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides good detail on data sources, preprocessing, the proposed ensemble model architecture (ConvLSTM, Transformer, GBDT, Bayesian averaging), algorithmic steps, community engagement strategy, and evaluation plan. Mathematical notations are used appropriately, although some details like the exact specification of the surrogate model or the GLCM/SAR features could be slightly more explicit. Overall, the proposal is easy to understand, with only minor areas potentially benefiting from further refinement."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components (ConvLSTM, Transformers, GBDTs, transfer learning, edge AI, community engagement) exist in the literature, the novelty lies in their specific integration into a holistic framework designed explicitly to bridge the theory-to-deployment gap for disaster EWS in low-resource settings. The proposed ensemble architecture combining spatio-temporal, sequential, and tabular models via uncertainty-aware Bayesian Model Averaging appears innovative for this application. Furthermore, the strong emphasis on integrating technical development with a structured community-centered deployment methodology, including interpretability via surrogate models and ethical considerations based on cited work, represents a fresh perspective compared to purely algorithm-focused research. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by tackling the end-to-end deployment challenge."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon established ML techniques (ConvLSTM, Transformers, GBDTs, transfer learning, Bayesian methods, MC dropout, surrogate models, quantization) and relevant theoretical foundations. The choice of models for different data modalities is well-justified. The methodology for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training (including transfer learning), ensemble creation, interpretability, and edge deployment is logical and technically coherent. The multi-stage evaluation plan is comprehensive, incorporating relevant metrics for accuracy, timeliness, fairness, interpretability, and computational cost. While the combination of methods is ambitious, the overall approach is robust and well-justified, with technical formulations being mostly correct and clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Accessing, cleaning, and integrating diverse multimodal data (satellite, meteorological, social media, IoT) from specific low-resource pilot regions can be difficult and time-consuming. The technical complexity of developing, training, and integrating the ensemble model, implementing transfer learning effectively, ensuring robust uncertainty quantification, optimizing for edge deployment, and building a reliable surrogate model requires significant expertise and computational resources. Furthermore, establishing genuine community partnerships, conducting co-design workshops, and implementing a real-time feedback loop requires substantial effort and careful management. The 6-month pilot deployment phase seems potentially short for thorough validation across different scenarios. While achievable with significant resources and a dedicated team, the ambitious scope introduces considerable risks related to data availability, technical integration, and practical deployment logistics."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of improving disaster EWS, particularly for vulnerable populations, directly contributing to multiple UN SDGs (1, 11, 13) and the core mission of Computational Sustainability. By focusing on the theory-to-deployment gap, it tackles a major bottleneck hindering the real-world impact of ML research. Successful execution could lead to substantial societal benefits (reduced false alarms, improved lead times, better resource allocation, enhanced resilience) and significant technical contributions (multimodal fusion, uncertainty quantification, interpretable edge AI). The project's potential to create a replicable blueprint for community-engaged, ethically-grounded ML deployment further enhances its significance for the CompSust field and beyond."
