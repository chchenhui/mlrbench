    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the CompSust workshop's theme of 'Promises and Pitfalls from Theory to Deployment' by focusing on bridging this gap in disaster management. It incorporates all key elements from the research idea (multimodal data, ensemble ML, transfer learning, interpretability, community-centered deployment, edge computing, SDGs). Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and proposes solutions for the key challenges identified in the literature review (data scarcity, interpretability, ethics, real-time processing, multimodal integration). The methodology and expected outcomes directly reflect the goals outlined in the task and idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, motivation, and overall approach are well-defined. The methodology section systematically outlines the steps from data collection to evaluation. The use of specific techniques (CNNs, NLP, Ensemble methods, SHAP/LIME) adds clarity. However, some implementation details could be slightly more specific (e.g., precise ensemble configurations, specific edge computing strategy, concrete methods for integrating community knowledge). Despite these minor points, the proposal is generally easy to understand with a logical structure."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While individual components like using ML for disaster warning, multimodal data integration, transfer learning, or community engagement exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the novelty lies in the proposed *integrated framework*. It synthesizes these elements into a holistic system specifically designed to bridge the theory-to-deployment gap in low-resource, disaster-prone settings, with a strong emphasis on community involvement, interpretability for decision-makers, and ethical considerations. The focus on creating a deployable, sustainable, and community-centric system, rather than just a predictive model, provides a fresh perspective aligned with the CompSust goals."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established ML techniques (CNNs, NLP, ensemble methods, transfer learning) and standard methodologies for data processing and evaluation. The rationale for choosing specific approaches (e.g., transfer learning for data scarcity, interpretability methods for trust) is well-justified. The inclusion of simulation studies, field trials, and comprehensive evaluation metrics (performance, interpretability, ethics/fairness) demonstrates methodological rigor. While the seamless integration of all components presents a challenge, the overall technical approach is well-founded and aligns with current best practices discussed in the literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Accessing diverse, high-quality, real-time data (especially commercial satellite imagery and deploying IoT networks) in low-resource settings can be difficult and costly. Implementing the wide range of proposed ML techniques, including edge computing, requires significant technical expertise and computational resources. Meaningful community engagement and conducting effective field trials are logistically complex and resource-intensive. The overall scope is ambitious, requiring substantial funding, time, and personnel. While technically possible, practical execution faces considerable hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of improving disaster resilience in vulnerable communities, directly contributing to multiple SDGs (1, 11, 13). By focusing on the theory-to-deployment gap, it tackles a core challenge within computational sustainability. Successful implementation could lead to tangible benefits like reduced loss of life, improved resource allocation, and enhanced community preparedness. Furthermore, it has the potential to generate valuable insights and best practices for deploying ML responsibly and effectively in other high-stakes, resource-constrained sustainability domains."
