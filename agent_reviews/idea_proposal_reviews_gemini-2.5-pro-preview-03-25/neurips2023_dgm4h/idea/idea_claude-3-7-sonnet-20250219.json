        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key themes of the workshop call: leveraging recent advancements in generative models (specifically diffusion models), combining multiple data modalities, tackling data scarcity/missingness (robustness to missing modalities, focus on rare diseases), aiming for explainable methods, and targeting under-explored application areas (rare diseases). It proposes a generative approach tailored to health applications, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, problem statement, and core components of the proposed method (multimodal diffusion, hierarchical architecture, shared latent space, adaptive training, domain-specific attention) are well-defined. The goals (robustness, accuracy for rare diseases, explainability) are explicit. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise implementation details of the attention mechanism or the diffusion process adaptation, but the overall concept is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While multimodal learning and diffusion models exist separately, their specific application to healthcare diagnostics with the proposed hierarchical architecture, shared latent space diffusion, domain-specific attention, and adaptive masking for robustness represents a fresh approach. Combining these elements to specifically target robustness to missing modalities and improved performance on rare diseases within a generative framework offers significant innovation beyond standard applications."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Training multimodal diffusion models requires substantial computational resources. Accessing and integrating diverse, high-quality multimodal clinical datasets (imaging, EHR, notes) is often difficult due to privacy regulations, data heterogeneity, and institutional barriers. Designing effective domain-specific attention and validating the model, especially for rare diseases and explainability, requires significant effort and expertise. While achievable in a well-resourced research setting, it's not straightforward."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in current medical AI, namely the effective integration of multimodal data, robustness to real-world data imperfections (missing modalities), and performance on underrepresented cases (rare diseases). Success could lead to major advancements in diagnostic accuracy and reliability, potentially enabling earlier or more accurate diagnoses, especially in complex scenarios. The focus on robustness and explainability also increases the potential for clinical translation and trust."
