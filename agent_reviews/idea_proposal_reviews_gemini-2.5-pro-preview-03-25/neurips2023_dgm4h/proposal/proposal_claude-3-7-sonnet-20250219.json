    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for using advanced generative models (specifically diffusion models) for health applications, tackling key challenges like multimodality, missing data, data scarcity (rare diseases), explainability, and robustness. It faithfully implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea. Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant recent works (MedM2G, MedCoDi-M, DiffMIC, etc.) and explicitly aiming to address the key challenges identified in the review (data scarcity, modality integration, missing data, explainability, validation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and outlines the proposed solution. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the architecture (modality-specific encoders, integration module, conditional diffusion model) with relevant mathematical formulations, the adaptive training strategy, and the approach for diagnostic prediction and explainability. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While leveraging existing concepts like diffusion models for medical data and multimodal fusion, it introduces several novel elements: 1) The specific hierarchical architecture combining modality-specific encoders with a unified latent space diffusion model tailored for robust diagnostics. 2) The integration of medical domain knowledge via a knowledge graph-enhanced attention mechanism, weighted by disease prevalence statistics. 3) The specific combination of adaptive training techniques (curriculum modality masking, rare disease oversampling, consistency regularization) within this framework. 4) Applying gradient-based attribution for modality-specific explainability in this context. The combination of these elements to simultaneously address robustness to missing data and improved performance on rare diseases represents a significant novel contribution beyond incremental improvements."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (diffusion models, transformers, attention mechanisms) and cites relevant prior work. The proposed methodology, including the hierarchical architecture, cross-modal attention, diffusion process formulation, and adaptive training strategies (masking, consistency loss), is technically plausible and well-justified. Mathematical formulations are provided and appear correct. Minor gaps exist in the detailed specification of certain components, such as the precise construction and integration of the knowledge graph relevance matrix and the strategy for tuning multiple loss terms, but the overall approach is robust and logically coherent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial computational resources for training complex diffusion models and large encoders, access to multiple large-scale medical datasets (requiring agreements and ethical considerations), and potentially specialized clinical expertise for knowledge graph development and explainability validation. Curating a suitable rare disease cohort could be particularly challenging. The model architecture itself is complex, involving multiple interacting components and loss functions, which will require careful implementation, extensive tuning, and robust engineering. While achievable within a well-resourced research setting, the complexity and data requirements introduce moderate risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical, unsolved problems in medical AI: robust handling of multimodal data, resilience to missing information (a major real-world issue), improving diagnostic accuracy for underserved rare diseases, and providing interpretable predictions crucial for clinical trust. Success would represent a major advancement in developing practical AI tools for healthcare. The potential impact includes improved diagnostic capabilities, enhanced clinical decision support, reduced healthcare costs (by potentially avoiding unnecessary tests), greater equity in care, and valuable methodological contributions to generative modeling and multimodal learning in medicine. The expected outcomes, if achieved, would be substantial."
