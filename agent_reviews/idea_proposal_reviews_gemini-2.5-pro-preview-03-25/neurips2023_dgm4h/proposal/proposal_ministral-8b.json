        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop task (deep generative models, diffusion models, health applications, multimodality, data scarcity, interpretability, robustness, validation, rare diseases). The methodology builds logically on the research idea, proposing a multimodal diffusion model to tackle the identified challenges. It effectively incorporates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as multimodal generation, diffusion models in medicine, handling missing data, and explainability. All sections of the proposal consistently reinforce the central theme and objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The background, objectives, and significance are clearly articulated. The methodology section provides a logical breakdown of the approach. However, some areas lack specific detail. For instance, the mechanism for incorporating 'domain-specific knowledge' via attention is vague. The mathematical formulations present standard diffusion equations but don't explicitly detail how the multimodal conditioning or shared latent space integration modifies these equations. The experimental design mentions evaluation aspects but lacks specifics on datasets (beyond 'diverse'), baselines, and concrete setups. The link between proposed interpretability metrics (mAP, AUC-ROC) and feature attribution maps needs clarification."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several recent advancements (multimodal architectures, diffusion models, domain-specific attention, adaptive training) into a specific framework for robust healthcare diagnostics. While individual components exist in the literature (as shown in the review), their integration into a hierarchical multimodal diffusion model tailored for handling missing modalities adaptively in the diagnostic context appears novel. It's not proposing a fundamentally new generative mechanism but rather a novel synthesis and application of existing techniques to address specific healthcare challenges like robustness and interpretability in multimodal settings. The distinction from prior work like MedM2G or MedCoDi-M lies in the specific architectural choices, the focus on adaptive training for missing modalities, and the explicit goal of diagnostic robustness."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on established theoretical foundations (diffusion models, multimodal learning, attention). The proposed methodology (hierarchical architecture, modality masking for robustness) is logical and well-justified based on the problem statement and literature. The experimental plan covers key aspects like accuracy, robustness, and explainability using generally appropriate metrics. Minor weaknesses include the lack of precise mathematical formulation for the multimodal conditioning within the diffusion process and the underspecified mechanism for incorporating domain knowledge via attention. However, the overall approach is technically coherent and grounded in relevant research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning data acquisition. Collecting diverse, multimodal clinical data, especially for rare diseases and underrepresented populations, is extremely challenging due to privacy regulations, data access restrictions, and curation effort. The proposal acknowledges the need but doesn't provide a concrete plan or evidence of access to such data, which is a critical bottleneck. Assuming data availability, the technical implementation (model building, training) is feasible with sufficient computational resources (diffusion models are demanding) and expertise, although complex. The evaluation plan is standard but requires careful execution, especially for interpretability assessment."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and timely challenges in healthcare AI: effectively utilizing multimodal data, overcoming data scarcity (particularly for rare diseases/minorities), improving robustness to real-world data imperfections (missing modalities), and enhancing model interpretability for clinical trust. Success in this research could lead to substantially more reliable and accurate diagnostic tools, potentially improving patient outcomes and promoting equitable healthcare. It directly aligns with the workshop's goal of advancing generative models for practical health applications with clinical relevance."
