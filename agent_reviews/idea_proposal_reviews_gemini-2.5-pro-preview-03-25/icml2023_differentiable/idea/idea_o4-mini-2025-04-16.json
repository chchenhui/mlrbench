        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for 'Continuous relaxations of discrete operations and algorithms (e.g., ... shortest-path)' and 'Weakly- and self-supervised learning with differentiable algorithms'. The SoftSP idea directly proposes a continuous relaxation (entropy-regularized softmin) for the non-differentiable shortest-path problem (Bellman recursion) and suggests using weak supervision (partial/noisy trajectories) for learning. It addresses a core scenario where vanilla automatic differentiation fails due to discrete steps, fitting the workshop's scope precisely."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (non-differentiability of shortest paths), the core technical proposal (entropy-regularized softmin relaxation of Bellman recursion using log-sum-exp), the mechanism (smooth values, path distributions, closed-form gradients), the implementation strategy (auto-diff block), the learning approach (weak supervision), and the evaluation plan are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. Minor implementation details are omitted, but the research concept itself is perfectly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While entropy regularization and softmin/log-sum-exp relaxations are known techniques in machine learning (e.g., related to softmax, optimal transport), applying this specific relaxation to the Bellman recursion for shortest paths to derive differentiable path lengths w.r.t edge weights, framing it as 'SoftSP', and proposing its use for end-to-end learning with weak supervision and integration into RL offers a novel contribution. It's a creative application and formulation of existing principles to solve a specific, relevant problem in differentiable algorithms, rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly practical and implementable. The core mathematical operation (log-sum-exp) is well-understood and numerically stable. Implementing this as a custom differentiable block within standard auto-diff frameworks (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) is straightforward for experienced ML researchers. Deriving the closed-form gradients is achievable. Training using SGD with weak supervision is standard. The proposed evaluation domains (grid mazes, traffic networks, RL integration) are common and feasible, although RL integration might require more effort. No extraordinary resources or unavailable technology seem necessary."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Making shortest-path planning differentiable allows for end-to-end learning of graph parameters (e.g., costs in robotics or traffic) from data, which is a valuable capability currently hindered by non-differentiability. Integrating differentiable planning modules into larger deep learning systems, particularly in reinforcement learning (potentially leading to better exploration or sample efficiency) and imitation learning, could enable new architectures and learning paradigms. It addresses a fundamental gap between classical algorithms and gradient-based learning."
