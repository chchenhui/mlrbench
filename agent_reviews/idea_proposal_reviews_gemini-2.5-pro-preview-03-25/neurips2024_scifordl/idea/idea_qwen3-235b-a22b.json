    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It proposes using empirical experiments (dataset distillation, intervention studies) following the scientific method (hypothesis testing about biases) to understand deep learning mechanisms (specifically, inductive biases of different architectures). This directly addresses the workshop's core goal of promoting empirical analysis to validate/falsify hypotheses and understand inner workings, fitting explicitly mentioned topics like 'inductive biases of learning algorithms' and the call for work shedding light on mechanisms rather than just SOTA performance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (lack of understanding of inductive biases), the core methodology (using dataset distillation as a probe), the experimental setup (comparing CNNs, Transformers, hybrids on structured datasets, intervention studies), and the specific research questions and expected outcomes (framework for bias assessment, empirical validation, design insights). Minor details like the exact nature of the 'structured patterns' or specific intervention techniques could be elaborated, but the overall concept is immediately understandable and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While dataset distillation (DD) is an existing technique and studying inductive biases is a known research area, the proposed use of DD *as an analytical probe* to systematically compare architectural biases by examining the content of the distilled datasets is a fresh perspective. Typically, DD focuses on efficiency or summarization. Applying it to reveal *what* information different architectures prioritize (local vs. global/semantic) and linking this to robustness through intervention experiments on the distilled data constitutes a novel approach to studying inductive biases empirically."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Dataset distillation algorithms, standard architectures (CNNs, Transformers), and suitable structured datasets (either existing or synthetically generated) are available. Analyzing the relatively small distilled datasets is computationally tractable. However, dataset distillation itself can be computationally intensive, especially for complex models or large original datasets. Careful experimental design is needed to ensure the distilled datasets meaningfully reflect the intended biases and are not artifacts of the distillation process itself. These challenges require attention but seem surmountable, making the overall idea feasible with moderate effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the inductive biases of different deep learning architectures is a fundamental and critical problem for model selection, generalization, robustness, and trustworthy AI. Providing a novel, systematic empirical framework to investigate and compare these biases could lead to major advancements in our understanding of *why* certain architectures excel at specific tasks. The expected outcomes (empirical validation of hypotheses, actionable insights for architecture design) directly address important gaps between theory and practice, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of high-impact research on DL mechanisms."
