    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions using the scientific method (hypotheses, controlled experiments) to understand deep learning, focusing on empirical analyses to validate/falsify theories rather than SOTA performance. The idea directly proposes such a framework (visualization, perturbation experiments, hypothesis testing) to investigate a specific topic mentioned in the call ('in-context learning in transformers', 'interpretability'). It perfectly matches the workshop's goal of promoting scientific understanding over performance metrics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (gap in understanding ICL mechanisms) is well-stated. The main components of the proposed framework (enhanced visualization, systematic perturbation, quantitative analysis) are outlined. The focus on testing falsifiable hypotheses is explicit. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the 'enhanced attention visualization tools' and the exact nature of the perturbation experiments, but the overall research direction and methodology are clearly understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While attention visualization and perturbation studies exist individually, the proposal to combine them into a systematic experimental framework specifically designed for rigorous, hypothesis-driven scientific exploration of ICL mechanisms is innovative. The emphasis on falsifiable hypotheses distinguishes it from many descriptive interpretability studies. It's not proposing entirely new techniques but rather a novel application and integration focused on scientific validation within the ICL context."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Transformer models are readily available, attention data can be extracted, and designing context perturbation experiments is practical. Standard quantitative methods can be used for analysis. Developing 'enhanced' visualization tools might require specific expertise and effort, but building upon existing visualization techniques is achievable. The required computational resources are likely standard for ML research involving transformer analysis. The overall plan seems implementable with current technology and methods."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the mechanisms behind in-context learning in transformers is a critical open problem in deep learning. Providing empirical evidence through controlled experiments to validate or refute theories about how attention enables ICL would be a major contribution. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of furthering fundamental understanding, potentially leading to significant advancements in theory and practice, even without directly aiming for SOTA performance."
