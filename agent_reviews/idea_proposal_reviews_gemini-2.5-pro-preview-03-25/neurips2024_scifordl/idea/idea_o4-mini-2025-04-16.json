    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the call for using the scientific method (controlled experiments via prompt perturbations) to understand deep learning mechanisms (specifically in-context learning). It fits explicitly mentioned topics like 'in-context learning in transformers' and '(mechanistic) interpretability'. The goal is to validate/falsify hypotheses about ICL mechanisms (retrieval vs. abstraction) through empirical analysis, precisely matching the workshop's focus on understanding rather than solely improving SOTA performance or proving theorems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (understanding ICL), the main approach (systematic prompt perturbations correlated with performance and internal model metrics like attention/representations), and the expected outcomes (sensitivity profiles, theoretical guidance, practical recommendations) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. Minor details like the specific synthetic/real-world tasks could be elaborated, but the core concept and methodology are immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While studying ICL and using prompt perturbations are established areas, the proposed systematic suite of diverse perturbations (order, noise, syntax, domain shifts) combined with the analysis of internal mechanisms (attention, representations) across different model scales and architectures specifically to *distinguish* between different ICL hypotheses (retrieval vs. abstraction) offers a fresh and structured approach. It synthesizes existing techniques in a novel way to tackle a specific mechanistic question, going beyond simple robustness checks."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Perturbing prompts, running LLMs, measuring performance, and accessing attention/representations are standard practices. Synthetic tasks can be designed, and suitable real-world benchmarks exist. The main challenge lies in the potentially large scale of experiments required (multiple perturbations, tasks, models, scales) which demands significant computational resources, but it does not present fundamental technical barriers. The analysis correlating performance with internal metrics is complex but achievable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of in-context learning is a critical open problem in the LLM field. Disentangling whether ICL relies on retrieval, pattern matching, or implicit algorithm execution has profound implications for interpretability, model robustness, prompt engineering, and the future design of more capable and reliable models. The potential findings could lead to major advancements in both theoretical understanding and practical applications of LLMs."
