        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on AI for children's healthcare, specifically pediatric disease detection using LLMs, which is listed as a key technology. It highlights the importance of early diagnosis, timely interventions, and potential benefits for low-resource settings, all mentioned as motivations in the task description. Furthermore, the proposal includes the creation of a new dataset, which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest for the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, problem statement (homogeneity assumption in current AI), proposed solution (developmental stage-aware LLM), key components (multimodal input, multi-task learning, age-stratified data), and expected impact are well-defined. The concept of integrating developmental stage-specific data is central and understandable. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific LLM architecture or the exact mechanism for integrating domain knowledge, but the overall research direction is clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While using LLMs in healthcare is established, the specific focus on *developmental stage awareness* within pediatric AI for early disease detection is innovative. Combining multimodal inputs, multi-task learning (disease risk + developmental milestones), and explicit modeling of developmental stages represents a fresh approach compared to treating pediatric data monolithically. The proposed creation of a developmental stage-annotated dataset also adds to the novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning data. Acquiring large-scale, diverse, age-stratified pediatric datasets with multimodal information (clinical notes, growth metrics, parental observations) and reliable developmental stage annotations is extremely difficult due to privacy regulations (HIPAA/GDPR), data fragmentation, and the cost/effort of annotation. Training/fine-tuning LLMs and implementing multi-task, multimodal learning is technically achievable but computationally intensive. Collaboration with clinical experts is crucial but adds complexity. The feasibility hinges heavily on overcoming the data acquisition and annotation bottleneck."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Early detection of pediatric diseases like autism and developmental delays is critical for timely intervention and improving long-term outcomes. Addressing the limitations of current AI models by incorporating developmental context could lead to major advancements in pediatric diagnostics. The potential to democratize access to early diagnosis, especially in low-resource settings, and reduce health disparities addresses a critical global health challenge. Success would represent a major contribution to pediatric AI and healthcare."
