        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses 'AI for Children' with a specific focus on 'pediatric healthcare' and 'early diagnosis of childhood diseases'. It proposes a 'New Method' (Multimodal Temporal Transformers) applied to a critical problem in child health, aiming to improve outcomes and potentially bridge gaps in 'low-resource countries'. The use of advanced AI techniques like transformers fits the workshop's interest in cutting-edge methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main technical approach (multimodal transformers, longitudinal data, specific modalities, federated learning), target population (children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders), and expected outcomes (>90% sensitivity, improved access) are explicitly stated and easy to understand. There is minimal ambiguity in the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using transformers for temporal data or multimodal analysis isn't entirely new, applying temporal transformers to longitudinal, naturalistic multimodal data (video/audio cues like facial expressions, vocal intonation, motor coordination, social engagement) specifically for *early* detection (by 24 months) of neurodevelopmental disorders is innovative. The integration with federated learning for privacy in this specific context adds another layer of novelty. It combines existing advanced techniques in a novel configuration for a challenging and specific problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. The primary challenge lies in acquiring large-scale, diverse, longitudinal, ethically sourced, and accurately annotated multimodal datasets of young children in naturalistic settings across different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Ensuring data quality and consistency is difficult. Training complex multimodal transformers and implementing federated learning effectively requires substantial computational resources and expertise. Achieving the ambitious >90% sensitivity target reliably is a major hurdle requiring rigorous validation. While technically plausible, the data acquisition and validation aspects present considerable practical difficulties."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Early detection of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and ADHD drastically improves intervention effectiveness and long-term outcomes. Current diagnostic methods often involve delays and accessibility issues. A scalable, objective, AI-based tool could revolutionize early screening, reduce diagnostic wait times, improve equitable access globally (especially in underserved regions), and facilitate timely interventions, potentially transforming the lives of many children and families."
