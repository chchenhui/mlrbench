    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses AI for child psychology and healthcare, utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal AI (vision, speech), focuses on early detection relevant to pediatrics, and explicitly mentions applicability in low-resource settings â€“ all key themes highlighted in the workshop call. It fits squarely within the scope of 'AI for Children: Healthcare, Psychology, Education'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the motivation (unrecognized childhood anxiety), the proposed solution (EmpathAI Kids), its core components (LLM, vision, speech), the interaction modality (gamified dialogue), the data captured, the analysis approach (classifier), and the validation plan. The objectives and expected outcomes are explicitly stated, leaving minimal ambiguity about the core concept."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While conversational agents and multi-modal emotion recognition exist, the specific application of combining an LLM with lightweight, edge-deployed vision and speech analysis within a gamified conversational agent *specifically for unobtrusive, early detection of childhood anxiety* is innovative. It moves beyond standard screening questionnaires towards capturing subtle behavioral cues during naturalistic interaction, offering a fresh approach to a known problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core technologies (LLMs, basic speech/vision analysis) are available. However, key challenges include: 1) Acquiring sufficient high-quality, ethically sourced, labeled pediatric anxiety data for training and validation. 2) Ensuring robust privacy preservation and child safety, especially with multi-modal data collection. 3) Achieving the high target accuracy (>80%) based on subtle, unobtrusive cues is ambitious. 4) Requires strong interdisciplinary collaboration (AI, psychology, pediatrics, ethics). While not impossible, these hurdles require considerable effort and resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Childhood anxiety is a critical mental health issue, and early detection can drastically improve outcomes. This tool addresses the limitations of traditional screening (accessibility, subtlety). If successful, it could provide a scalable, accessible method for early warning, enabling timely interventions, reducing long-term psychological burden, and potentially bridging healthcare gaps, especially in low-resource settings. It addresses a critical problem with the potential for major advancements in pediatric mental health screening."
