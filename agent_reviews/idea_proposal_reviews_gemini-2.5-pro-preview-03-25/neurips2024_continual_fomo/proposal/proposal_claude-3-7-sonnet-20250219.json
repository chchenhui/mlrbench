    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the workshop task description, such as scalable continual learning (CL) for foundation models (FMs), catastrophic forgetting, computational costs, domain shifts, and the integration of structured knowledge sources (specifically knowledge graphs). The methodology section provides a detailed elaboration of the research idea, outlining the dynamic knowledge graph (DKG), knowledge-infused adapters (KIAs), and cross-attention retrieval (CAKR). Furthermore, the proposal effectively positions itself within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging prior work like K-Adapter while clearly differentiating its novel contributions (dynamic KG, integrated retrieval for CL). It explicitly aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the literature review summary."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from introduction and motivation to a detailed methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. Key components like DKG, KIA, and CAKR are defined, and the overall workflow is understandable. Mathematical formulations are provided for core concepts. The experimental plan is well-defined with specific datasets, baselines, and metrics. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for subgraph extraction from raw data and the exact dimensional interplay within the KIA formula involving CAKR output, but these do not significantly obscure the main ideas. The rationale behind the approach is clearly explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While adapters and knowledge graph infusion are known concepts (e.g., K-Adapter), the core novelty lies in the combination and specific application to *scalable continual learning* for FMs. Key innovative aspects include: 1) The *dynamic* nature of the knowledge graph, designed to evolve incrementally with new data streams. 2) The tight integration of the DKG with adapters via a *cross-attention retrieval mechanism* (CAKR) specifically during the CL update process. 3) The explicit focus on *scalability* through sparse retrieval and graph consolidation tailored for large FMs. This approach differs significantly from static knowledge infusion (K-Adapter), inter-adapter communication (Linked Adapters), or methods focused solely on KG embedding updates (Incremental LoRA)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established principles: parameter-efficient adaptation using adapters, knowledge representation using KGs, attention mechanisms for information retrieval, and knowledge distillation to mitigate forgetting. The proposed methodology, combining these elements into the DKGIA framework, is logical and theoretically grounded. The mathematical formulations for adapter updates, loss functions, similarity measures, and attention are generally correct and clearly presented. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics for evaluation. Potential weaknesses lie in the practical implementation of robust knowledge extraction and the heuristics needed for KG consolidation/pruning, but the overall technical approach is well-justified and aligns with current research directions."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core components (FMs, adapters, attention) are well-understood. However, integrating a *dynamic* KG system that efficiently updates, prunes, and allows for sparse retrieval synchronized with adapter training requires significant engineering effort and careful system design. Ensuring the scalability of the DKG and the efficiency of the CAKR mechanism, especially for very large FMs and extensive knowledge bases, is non-trivial. While the use of standard benchmarks and the parameter-efficient nature of adapters enhance feasibility compared to full retraining, the added complexity of the dynamic KG component introduces manageable risks and requires substantial resources (compute for KG processing, expertise in KGs and systems)."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations of current foundation models: knowledge obsolescence, catastrophic forgetting, and the prohibitive cost of retraining. Enabling efficient and effective continual learning for FMs would represent a major advancement, making AI systems more adaptable, sustainable, and capable of lifelong learning. The potential impact includes substantial reductions in computational costs and environmental footprint, improved model performance in dynamic environments, and a step towards more general AI. The research directly tackles key questions highlighted in the workshop task description, positioning it at the forefront of scalable CL research."
