    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task description: scalable continual learning (CL) for foundation models (FMs) to overcome limitations of static training. The research objectives (mitigating forgetting, efficient transfer, scalability, KG integration, evaluation) perfectly match the key challenges identified in the literature review and the topics of interest for the workshop (avoiding retraining, forgetting on smaller datasets, real-world shifts, structured knowledge sources, benchmarks). The methodology directly implements the research idea of using dynamic KG-infused adapters, referencing concepts like sparse retrieval and graph consolidation mentioned in the idea. The proposal consistently uses the terminology and framing from the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The objectives, significance, and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The methodology provides a good overview and breaks down the approach into logical components (KG Embeddings, Adapter Modules). However, some technical details could be more precise. For instance, how the retrieved KG facts 'steer parameter updates' in the adapter is not fully specified (e.g., mechanism for influencing gradients). Similarly, the 'sparse retrieval mechanism' and 'graph consolidation' mention techniques (k-NN/GNNs, clustering) but lack specifics on implementation criteria (e.g., relevance definition for retrieval, similarity metric for consolidation). While generally understandable, these ambiguities slightly detract from perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While adapters and knowledge graphs have been used separately or in simpler combinations (like K-Adapter for static knowledge infusion), the core idea of using *dynamic* KGs that are incrementally updated and *selectively* infused into adapters via cross-attention specifically for *scalable continual learning* of FMs appears novel. It distinguishes itself from prior work like Linked Adapters (adapter-adapter interaction), Fast Continual KG Embedding (focus on KG embedding CL itself), and I2I (adapter initialization). The combination of dynamic KG updates, sparse retrieval, cross-attention infusion into adapters, and graph consolidation presents a fresh approach to leveraging structured knowledge for lifelong FM adaptation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, built upon established techniques like adapters, KG embeddings (Node2Vec/GCN), attention mechanisms, and CL principles. The literature review supports the relevance of these components. The methodology is plausible, outlining reasonable steps for KG construction, updates, retrieval, and adapter integration. However, the soundness score is slightly tempered because some crucial mechanisms lack rigorous definition. The effectiveness of 'steering' parameter updates via KG facts needs clearer technical formulation. The practical performance of sparse retrieval (balancing relevance and efficiency) and graph consolidation (avoiding information loss) depends heavily on implementation details not fully specified. While the overall approach is well-grounded, these specific points require further technical justification to ensure full rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant engineering challenges. The required technologies (FMs, adapters, KGs, GNNs, attention) exist, and the proposed benchmarks are standard. However, implementing and integrating the dynamic KG component (efficient updates, embedding, storage, sparse retrieval, consolidation) alongside large FMs is complex and computationally intensive. Constructing and maintaining high-quality dynamic KGs from incoming data streams is non-trivial. Significant expertise in multiple ML areas and substantial computational resources would be required. While achievable within a well-resourced research setting, the complexity and potential bottlenecks in the KG management system pose moderate risks to straightforward implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in machine learning: enabling foundation models to learn continually and efficiently adapt to new information without catastrophic forgetting or costly retraining. This is crucial for deploying FMs in dynamic real-world environments. The proposed approach, leveraging dynamic structured knowledge (KGs), offers a promising direction to tackle this challenge. If successful, the research could lead to major advancements in CL, making FMs more practical, scalable, and continuously relevant. The focus on establishing standardized benchmarks also adds significant value to the research community. The potential impact on both the theory and practice of large-scale AI models is substantial."
