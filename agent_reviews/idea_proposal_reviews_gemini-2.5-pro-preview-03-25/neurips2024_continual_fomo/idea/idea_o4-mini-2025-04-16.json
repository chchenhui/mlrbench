        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task description. It directly addresses several key topics: utilizing CL methods to avoid retraining large FMs (using adapters), tackling catastrophic forgetting on smaller datasets (KG-infused adapters for knowledge retention), addressing CL on a large scale with domain shifts and long-tailed distributions (explicitly mentioned validation), combining FMs with structured knowledge sources (core idea uses KGs), and aiming for scalability (lightweight adapters, sparse retrieval, lower compute). It fits perfectly within the scope of 'Scalable Continual Learning for Lifelong Foundation Models'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly. The motivation outlines the problem well. The main components (adapters, dynamic KGs, cross-attention retrieval, sparse mechanism, consolidation) are described, and the overall goal (efficient CL, knowledge retention) is evident. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact implementation details of the dynamic KG updates, the sparse retrieval mechanism, and the cross-attention integration, but these are acceptable for a research idea summary. The core concept is well-articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While adapters for CL and using KGs with NNs are existing concepts, the specific combination of *dynamic*, incrementally updated KGs *infused into adapters* via cross-attention for the purpose of *scalable continual learning* in FMs is innovative. The focus on dynamic graph management (sparse retrieval, consolidation) tailored to the CL adapter setting adds to the originality. It's a novel synthesis and application of existing techniques to address a specific, challenging problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Adapters are standard, KGs and embeddings are well-understood, and attention mechanisms are mature. However, implementing a *dynamic* KG that scales efficiently, including incremental updates, sparse retrieval, and consolidation alongside FM adaptation, presents moderate engineering challenges. Ensuring the KG operations don't become a new bottleneck and effectively guide adaptation requires careful design and experimentation. It's plausible but requires significant implementation effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Addressing catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining/updating foundation models is a critical challenge in modern AI. Enabling scalable continual learning, especially by leveraging structured knowledge to improve efficiency and knowledge retention, would be a major advancement. If successful, this approach could offer a practical solution for maintaining large models over time, making it highly relevant and impactful for the field."
