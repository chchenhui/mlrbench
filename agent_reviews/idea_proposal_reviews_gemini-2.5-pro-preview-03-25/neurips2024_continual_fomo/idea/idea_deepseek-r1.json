        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's theme of 'Scalable Continual Learning for Lifelong Foundation Models'. It directly addresses several key topics listed in the call for papers: mitigating catastrophic forgetting in FMs fine-tuned on smaller datasets, combining FMs with structured knowledge sources (specifically KGs), and implicitly touches upon avoiding retraining and handling domain shifts via KG metadata. The focus on reducing forgetting while maintaining efficiency (<5% additional compute) directly targets the scalability aspect central to the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The core idea of using a dynamic KG to identify and isolate 'knowledge-anchored' parameters while adaptively updating others is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, proposed mechanism (parameter isolation, sparse activation via adapters/prompts), and expected outcomes are stated. However, crucial technical details lack precision. For instance, the exact mechanism for 'jointly maintaining and aligning' the KG with the FM's latent space, how parameters are precisely identified as 'knowledge-anchored' based on the KG, and the specifics of the KG expansion and task routing are ambiguous and require further elaboration for a complete understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using KGs with neural models or parameter isolation techniques for CL are not entirely new concepts in themselves, the proposed synthesis is innovative. Specifically, using a *dynamic* KG to actively guide parameter-level plasticity (freezing critical parts identified via KG alignment, activating adaptable parts like adapters) within large FMs for the purpose of *scalable* CL represents a fresh approach. The integration of KG structure for task routing within this CL framework also adds to the novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. While individual components like parameter freezing, adapters/prompts, and KG embeddings exist, dynamically maintaining a large KG, ensuring its continuous alignment with a large FM's evolving latent space, and performing KG-guided parameter identification/routing efficiently presents substantial technical hurdles. The claim of achieving a 30-50% forgetting reduction with less than 5% additional compute seems highly optimistic, as KG operations (updates, queries, alignment) can be computationally intensive, potentially undermining the scalability goal. Significant research and engineering effort would be needed to realize this efficiently."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Catastrophic forgetting is a fundamental bottleneck for the practical deployment of FMs in dynamic, real-world scenarios requiring continuous adaptation. Developing scalable CL methods that preserve core knowledge while efficiently incorporating new information is critical for enabling truly lifelong learning AI systems. If successful, this approach could lead to major advancements in areas like personalized AI, domain-adaptive systems (e.g., medical diagnosis), and robotics, making FMs more practical and sustainable."
