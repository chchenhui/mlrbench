        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of scalable continual learning (CL) for foundation models (FMs). It explicitly tackles several key topics mentioned in the call: avoiding retraining large FMs (by updating a KG), addressing catastrophic forgetting (via external knowledge), handling domain shifts/long-tail data (mentioned as evaluation targets), and specifically exploring the combination of FMs with structured knowledge sources (the central proposal). The motivation clearly outlines problems like static training, resource intensity, and forgetting, which are central to the workshop's premise."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with good clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem space (challenges in CL for FMs) and the proposed solution's rationale (using KGs). The main idea (KG-CL) is well-articulated, describing the key components (FM, dynamic KG interface, GNNs, adapters) and the proposed mechanism (retrieval-augmented learning, alternating training). The expected outcomes and evaluation strategy (metrics like backward transfer, efficiency) are also specified. While the core concept is clear, some finer implementation details (e.g., specific GNN architecture, precise graph update mechanism) could be further elaborated, leaving minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using knowledge graphs (KGs) with NNs or employing retrieval augmentation are not entirely new concepts, the proposed KG-CL framework offers a novel synthesis. Specifically, the integration of a *dynamic* KG updated via retrieval-augmented learning, the use of GNNs to propagate these updates within the CL context for FMs, and the alternating training strategy represent a fresh approach compared to typical CL methods focusing solely on model parameters (regularization, replay) or architecture modifications. It distinctively leverages external structured knowledge as an active component in the continual learning loop for large models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea has good feasibility, although with moderate challenges. The core components (FMs, KGs, GNNs, adapters, contrastive learning) are existing technologies. The proposed alternating training scheme is plausible. However, practical implementation faces hurdles: 1) Scalability and efficiency of managing and updating a large, dynamic KG, especially under rapid data influx. 2) Complexity of effectively integrating the FM, KG, and GNN components to ensure seamless information flow and representation alignment. 3) Designing robust mechanisms for encoding diverse incoming information into meaningful graph structures. While challenging, these seem surmountable within a dedicated research effort, making the idea largely feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds good significance. It addresses a critical and timely problem: enabling foundation models to learn continually and efficiently without costly retraining, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Success could lead to more sustainable, adaptable, and up-to-date AI systems, particularly in dynamic domains like healthcare or finance. The potential to reduce the computational cost and carbon footprint of updating large models is a major benefit. By bridging structured knowledge and continual learning for FMs, it could open valuable avenues for research and practical deployment, offering substantial impact."
