    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task description: adapting foundation models in federated settings while tackling privacy, efficiency, and heterogeneity issues. The proposed FedePT framework aligns perfectly with the research idea, elaborating on federated prompt tuning, dynamic aggregation, and privacy mechanisms. It explicitly builds upon the cited literature (FedBPT, FedDTPT), acknowledging prior work while proposing specific improvements, particularly the dynamic aggregation strategy for non-IID data, which is a key challenge mentioned in both the task and literature review. All objectives and methods are consistent with the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, significance, methodology, and experimental design are presented logically and concisely. The FedePT framework is explained in detail, including the mathematical formulation for prefix tuning, local updates, the novel dynamic aggregation weights, and privacy mechanisms (secure aggregation, DP). The pseudocode provides a clear algorithmic summary. The experimental plan is specific regarding datasets, baselines, metrics, and hyperparameters. There are no significant ambiguities, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While federated prompt tuning itself is an emerging area with existing work cited (FedBPT, FedDTPT), this proposal introduces a specific, novel dynamic aggregation mechanism based on weighting client updates by their divergence from the mean update. This directly targets the key challenge of data heterogeneity in a way distinct from uniform averaging or the methods mentioned in the cited literature (e.g., attention/clustering in FedDTPT). The combination of gradient-based prefix tuning (as opposed to some black-box methods cited), this specific dynamic aggregation, and integrated privacy mechanisms constitutes a fresh approach within the federated prompt tuning space. It's not entirely groundbreaking, but offers a clear, well-justified novel component."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations: federated learning principles (client-server architecture, local training, aggregation), prompt tuning techniques (prefix tuning), secure aggregation protocols, and differential privacy mechanisms (Gaussian noise addition). The proposed methodology is technically well-defined, with clear mathematical formulations for the prompt tuning process, loss function, local updates, dynamic aggregation weights, and DP noise addition. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant non-IID scenarios, standard benchmarks, appropriate baselines, and a wide range of metrics to evaluate performance, efficiency, and privacy. The technical details appear correct and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on standard machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, HuggingFace), established techniques (prefix tuning, FedAvg structure, DP), and widely used benchmarks (GLUE, SQuAD). Simulating the federated environment, including non-IID data splits and secure aggregation (or its simulation), is standard practice in FL research. The chosen foundation models (BERT-base, GPT-2 small) are manageable in terms of computational resources for research purposes. The scope is well-defined, and the experimental plan is realistic. No extraordinary resources or unavailable technologies are required, making successful execution highly likely."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: enabling the efficient and privacy-preserving adaptation of powerful foundation models in decentralized settings. As highlighted in the task description, this is crucial for deploying these models in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance where data cannot be centralized. By focusing on lightweight prompt tuning and tackling data heterogeneity and privacy, the research has the potential to significantly lower the barriers to entry for using foundation models, democratize access, and inform best practices for balancing utility, efficiency, and privacy in FL. Successful outcomes would represent a substantial contribution to the field."
