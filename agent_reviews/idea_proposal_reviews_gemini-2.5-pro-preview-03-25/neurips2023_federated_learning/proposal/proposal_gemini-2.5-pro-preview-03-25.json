    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the task description, such as adapting foundation models via FL, handling data heterogeneity, ensuring privacy, and improving efficiency (specifically mentioning prompt tuning). It systematically expands on the research idea, providing concrete methodological details. Furthermore, it correctly positions itself relative to the cited literature (FedBPT, FedDTPT, Fed-BBPT) by acknowledging their focus on black-box settings and explicitly targeting the white-box, gradient-based scenario, thereby addressing a relevant gap and the key challenges identified."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, problem statement, and objectives are articulated precisely. The methodology section provides a detailed step-by-step description of the FedTune framework, the specific prompt tuning techniques to be explored, the novel aggregation strategies (PWA, USCA, SWA), the integration of privacy techniques (SecAgg, DP), and a comprehensive experimental plan. The structure is logical, and the language is unambiguous, making the proposal easy to understand. Minor details regarding specific algorithm parameters or protocol choices are understandably left for the implementation phase but do not detract from the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While Federated Prompt Tuning itself is emerging (as shown in the literature review), this proposal's novelty lies in several key areas: 1) Focusing specifically on the *white-box*, gradient-based FPT setting, which is less explored for heterogeneity robustness compared to the black-box approaches cited. 2) Proposing *novel, specific aggregation strategies (PWA, USCA, SWA)* tailored to handle data heterogeneity within this white-box FPT context, going beyond standard FedAvg or generic FL heterogeneity methods like FedProx. 3) Planning a systematic comparison of different prompt/PEFT methods within this robust FL framework under non-IID conditions. 4) Integrating and evaluating standard privacy techniques (SecAgg, DP) specifically for FPT, including a privacy-utility trade-off analysis. The novelty is clearly articulated and justified against the backdrop of existing work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations in Federated Learning, Foundation Models, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), Differential Privacy, and Secure Aggregation. The proposed FedTune framework follows standard FL procedures. The novel aggregation strategies (PWA, USCA, SWA) are well-motivated heuristics based on plausible ideas (performance weighting, update clustering, similarity weighting) to combat heterogeneity. While theoretical convergence guarantees for these specific aggregation methods are not provided (common at the proposal stage), the overall approach is logical. The experimental design is rigorous, including appropriate baselines, datasets, non-IID simulation methods, and evaluation metrics. Technical formulations for standard components like local updates and DP appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on standard, widely available resources: pre-trained models (RoBERTa, ViT), benchmark datasets (GLUE, CIFAR), ML frameworks (PyTorch), and FL simulation libraries (Flower, FedML). Simulating non-IID data is a standard technique. The core technical challenge lies in implementing the FedTune framework and the novel aggregation strategies, which is complex but well within the capabilities of typical ML research labs. Integrating DP is straightforward; integrating SecAgg might require more effort depending on the chosen protocol, but conceptual integration is feasible. The plan is realistic, and the risks (hyperparameter tuning, simulation scale) are manageable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck at the intersection of three major trends: Foundation Models, Federated Learning, and PEFT. Solving the challenge of efficiently adapting FMs on decentralized, heterogeneous, and private data would be a major contribution. The potential impact is substantial: enabling practical deployment of FMs in sensitive domains (healthcare, finance), advancing FL algorithms with novel aggregation techniques tailored for PEFT, providing valuable benchmarks, and promoting privacy-preserving AI. The research directly tackles key issues highlighted in the task description and has the potential for broad scientific and practical relevance."
