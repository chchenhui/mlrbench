    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task: applying FL to foundation models, focusing specifically on the listed topic of 'Prompt tuning in federated settings'. The objectives (Efficiency, Heterogeneity, Privacy, Scalability) directly map to the challenges discussed in the task description (computation, data access, privacy, heterogeneity) and the research idea. The methodology incorporates concepts like lightweight parameter tuning and secure aggregation mentioned in the idea and builds upon the cited literature (FedBPT, FedDTPT etc.) by proposing extensions like dynamic aggregation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, research design, algorithmic steps, evaluation metrics, and experimental setup are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The significance and expected outcomes are also clearly stated. However, the core novel component – the 'dynamic prompt aggregation mechanism that weights contributions based on client data diversity and quality' – lacks specific detail on how 'diversity and quality' will be measured and translated into weights (wc). This minor ambiguity slightly reduces the perfect clarity score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates satisfactory novelty. Federated prompt tuning itself is an active area of research, as evidenced by the 2023/2024 literature review (FedBPT, FedDTPT). The core novelty lies in the proposed 'dynamic prompt aggregation mechanism' based on data diversity and quality, aiming to improve handling of heterogeneity, and the plan to benchmark multiple prompt tuning techniques (prefix tuning, LoRA, FedBPT) within this FL framework. While not groundbreaking, this specific aggregation approach and the comparative benchmarking offer a novel contribution beyond existing cited works, which focus on specific techniques (often black-box or discrete)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established principles of federated learning (local training, aggregation, global update), prompt tuning (lightweight parameter adaptation), and privacy techniques (secure aggregation, DP). The overall framework is logical. However, the soundness score is slightly limited because the crucial 'dynamic prompt aggregation mechanism' based on 'data diversity and quality' is not mathematically formulated or rigorously defined. The justification for how these factors will be measured and why they are expected to improve aggregation over simpler weighting schemes (e.g., by data size) needs further theoretical backing or empirical evidence cited."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Simulating FL environments, using standard datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet, NLP benchmarks), employing pre-trained foundation models (BERT, T5), and implementing known prompt tuning techniques (prefix tuning, LoRA) are all achievable with current tools and knowledge. Secure aggregation protocols exist. The main feasibility challenge lies in the practical implementation and validation of the novel dynamic weighting mechanism. Defining and reliably measuring 'data diversity and quality' across clients and integrating this into the aggregation step requires careful design but seems achievable within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of federated learning and foundation models: enabling efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation of large models on decentralized data. Success would lower barriers to using foundation models in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, democratize access to powerful AI, and contribute valuable insights into handling data heterogeneity in FL for large models – a key challenge highlighted in the task description."
