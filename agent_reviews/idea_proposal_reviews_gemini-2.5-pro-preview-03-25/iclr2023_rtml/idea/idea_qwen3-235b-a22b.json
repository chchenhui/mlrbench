    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned, including 'Explainable and interpretable methods for large-scale AI', 'Novel methods for building more trustworthy large-scale machine learning models', and ensuring 'robustness' especially 'under domain shifts or maliciously tailored attacks'. The motivation explicitly links to the task's concerns about 'black boxes', lack of faithful explanations, and the need for trustworthy AI in high-stakes domains. The proposed modular, causal approach aims to build trustworthiness directly into the model, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (modular architecture with embedded causal reasoning), training objective (multi-objective loss), and evaluation plan are well-defined. Concepts like 'disentangled, causal reasoning' and 'lightweight causal graphs' are introduced clearly in context. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanisms for embedding causality or constructing the lightweight graphs, but these are acceptable details for a research idea summary. Overall, the proposal is understandable and its components are logically connected."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While modularity, causality, and interpretability are existing research areas, the proposed integration—embedding modular, disentangled causal reasoning directly into the architecture of large-scale models *by design* rather than applying post-hoc methods—is innovative. Using lightweight causal graphs for pruning within this specific framework also adds to the novelty. It offers a fresh perspective compared to standard interpretability techniques or typical modular network designs, focusing on inherent, causal explainability for robustness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Designing and training modular architectures is achievable. However, embedding robust and scalable *causal reasoning* within large models is technically demanding. Discovering or defining accurate causal chains, ensuring disentanglement, and integrating this effectively with high-dimensional data and complex model functions are non-trivial research problems. Training with the multi-objective loss requires careful balancing. While conceptually sound, translating the causal component into a practical, scalable implementation for large models requires considerable research effort and may face hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of trustworthiness, interpretability, and robustness in large-scale AI models, which is a central theme of the task description. Developing models that are inherently interpretable and robust, especially under shifts and attacks, would be a major advancement for deploying AI in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law. The modular aspect allowing fine-grained diagnosis further enhances its potential impact on fairness, accountability, and reliability. Success would represent a substantial contribution to the field of trustworthy AI."
