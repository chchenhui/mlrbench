        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions on 'Machine unlearning to mitigate the privacy, toxicity, and bias issues within large-scale AI models', which is the core focus of this proposal. It directly addresses the concerns outlined in the task regarding privacy risks (data leakage, sensitive content), bias, and toxicity in large-scale models (LLMs). Furthermore, it aims to provide verifiable privacy guarantees and focuses on efficiency, both relevant aspects mentioned in the task description concerning trustworthy large-scale AI."

        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core problem, proposed approach (combining PEFT and gradient influence), and key steps (identification, isolation, removal/perturbation, refinement) are well-defined. The goals, such as scalability, low computational overhead compared to retraining, formal privacy guarantees, and the creation of a benchmark/toolkit, are specific. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise gradient tracing method, the exact mechanism for removing/perturbing PEFT modules to achieve unlearning without impacting general knowledge excessively, and the specifics of achieving formal differential unlearning guarantees via this method, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While machine unlearning, PEFT, and gradient-based influence estimation are existing concepts, their proposed integration for scalable LLM unlearning is innovative. Specifically, using PEFT modules not just for adaptation but as targeted containers for data influence that can be selectively manipulated or removed for unlearning presents a fresh perspective. This contrasts with methods that might require broader model retraining or fine-tuning. The combination aims to achieve targeted unlearning with high efficiency, which is a novel approach in the context of massive LLMs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents research challenges. PEFT methods are mature and efficient. Gradient-based influence estimation is computationally intensive but potentially manageable when focused on smaller PEFT modules rather than the entire LLM. Access to LLMs and computational resources is standard for this research area. Key challenges include: 1) Precisely isolating the influence of specific data points within compact PEFT modules without significant leakage or collateral damage to general capabilities. 2) Effectively removing or neutralizing this influence by manipulating the modules. 3) Validating the claimed <5% computational overhead compared to retraining. 4) Rigorously establishing formal privacy guarantees (like differential unlearning) through this specific mechanism, which requires careful theoretical and empirical work. While plausible, successful implementation requires overcoming these non-trivial technical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and urgent problem of removing problematic data (sensitive, biased, toxic) from deployed LLMs, which is essential for building trustworthy AI systems and complying with regulations like GDPR. Current methods like full retraining are often infeasible for state-of-the-art LLMs due to cost. A scalable, efficient, and precise unlearning method, as proposed, would be a major advancement. Success would provide practical tools for developers, enhance user trust, mitigate ethical risks, and potentially set a standard through the proposed benchmark, significantly impacting the field of responsible AI and LLM deployment."
