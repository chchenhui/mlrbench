    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for machine unlearning in LLMs to mitigate privacy, toxicity, and bias issues, emphasizing efficiency and verifiable guarantees (differential unlearning). The methodology clearly implements the research idea by combining PEFT and gradient-based influence estimation. It explicitly references and builds upon relevant works cited in the literature review (Fast-NTK, S3T, LMEraser, SalUn), positioning itself within the current research landscape and addressing the highlighted challenges like efficiency and utility preservation. All sections, from objectives to experimental design, consistently reflect the core goals outlined in the task and idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology, experiments, and impact. The objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The methodology is broken down into distinct, understandable stages (A-D), with key concepts like PEFT decomposition, influence estimation (including formula), targeted unlearning strategies, and differential unlearning clearly explained. The experimental design is detailed, specifying models, datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies, leaving little room for ambiguity. The language is precise and technical where necessary, but remains accessible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing a specific combination of existing techniques applied in a new way. While PEFT for unlearning (Fast-NTK, S3T, LMEraser) and gradient-based influence (SalUn) exist, the core novelty lies in: 1) Applying gradient-based influence estimation *specifically to the PEFT modules (LoRA adapters)* to identify targeted components for unlearning within LLMs. 2) Integrating formal differential unlearning guarantees within this specific PEFT-adapter-influence framework. This synthesis is distinct from prior work that might use different PEFT methods, apply influence globally, or lack formal privacy guarantees integrated in this manner. It's not a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift but offers a fresh, well-motivated approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations: PEFT for capturing fine-tuning information, gradient-based methods for influence estimation, and established techniques for differential privacy (noise injection, RÃ©nyi-DP). The methodology is logical and technically described, including mathematical formulations for influence and updates. The experimental plan is rigorous, including relevant baselines, comprehensive metrics, and ablation studies. A minor weakness is the underlying assumption that PEFT modules capture the *majority* of the influence of the data-to-be-forgotten, which might not fully hold if significant information resides in the frozen base model parameters. However, this is a reasonable and testable hypothesis for initiating the research. The technical formulations presented are correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It leverages standard frameworks (PyTorch, HuggingFace), libraries for PEFT (LoRA implementations exist), and differential privacy (Opacus). The required resources (LLMs, compute) are standard for LLM research, and the proposal aims specifically to *reduce* computational overhead compared to retraining. The technical steps (gradient calculation, module modification, fine-tuning) are complex but well-established procedures in ML research. The experimental plan is detailed and realistic. The main risks are empirical (achieving the desired performance/privacy/efficiency trade-offs) rather than fundamental roadblocks to implementation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: enabling efficient, effective, and provably private data deletion from large language models. This directly tackles critical concerns regarding privacy compliance (GDPR/CCPA), AI ethics (bias, toxicity), and the trustworthiness of widely deployed AI systems, as highlighted in the task description. Success would provide a valuable tool for practitioners, facilitate regulatory compliance, enhance LLM safety, and advance the field of trustworthy ML. The inclusion of formal differential unlearning guarantees adds significant weight, moving beyond heuristic approaches. The plan to release benchmarks further amplifies its potential impact on the research community."
