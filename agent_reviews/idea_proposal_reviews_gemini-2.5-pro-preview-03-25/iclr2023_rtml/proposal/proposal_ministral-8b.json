        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on trustworthy AI, specifically machine unlearning for mitigating privacy/bias issues in large-scale models using efficient methods like PEFT. The objectives and methodology perfectly reflect the research idea, proposing the integration of PEFT and gradient-based influence for scalable unlearning. It incorporates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as computational efficiency, preserving model utility, and the need for privacy guarantees. All components (introduction, objectives, methodology, outcomes) consistently build upon the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, and the overall methodology follows a logical progression. The use of PEFT, gradient tracing, and evaluation metrics is understandable. However, some aspects could benefit from refinement. Specifically, the exact mechanism for 'isolating data-specific influences into modular PEFT components' based on gradients, and the subsequent 'selective removal or perturbation' process, lacks detailed explanation. Furthermore, how 'formal privacy guarantees, such as differential unlearning,' will be achieved methodologically is not specified, leaving some ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory originality. It combines existing techniques – Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and gradient-based influence estimation – for machine unlearning in LLMs. The literature review shows that both PEFT (Fast-NTK, S3T, LMEraser) and gradient-based methods (SalUn) have been explored for unlearning. The novelty lies in the specific proposed integration: using gradient tracing to identify influences and then isolating these influences within PEFT modules for targeted removal or perturbation. While not groundbreaking, this specific modular approach applied to LLMs offers a potentially distinct and scalable strategy compared to prior work, representing an incremental innovation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has weaknesses. It builds on established techniques like PEFT and gradient analysis, which are theoretically grounded. The methodology of using gradients to identify influential data and fine-tuning is plausible. However, the core assumption that data-specific influence can be effectively *isolated* into low-rank PEFT modules needs strong empirical validation and lacks theoretical backing within the proposal. More significantly, the objective to provide 'formal privacy guarantees, such as differential unlearning,' is stated without outlining a specific mechanism (e.g., noise injection calibrated to sensitivity). Achieving formal differential privacy/unlearning guarantees is non-trivial and typically requires more rigorous algorithmic design than simply perturbing modules based on gradients. This claim weakens the overall soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard LLMs, publicly available datasets, and established techniques like PEFT and gradient computation, which are accessible with adequate computational resources common in LLM research. Implementing the core components seems practical. However, challenges exist: efficiently computing gradients for influence on large models, empirically validating the effectiveness of isolating influence in PEFT modules, carefully balancing unlearning with performance preservation, and potentially scaling to the very largest models. Achieving the *formal* privacy guarantees, as mentioned under Soundness, presents a significant feasibility challenge beyond empirical unlearning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: enabling efficient and reliable unlearning in large language models to address critical privacy and ethical concerns (e.g., GDPR compliance, bias mitigation). The prohibitive cost of retraining LLMs makes scalable unlearning methods essential. If successful, the research could provide a valuable tool for deploying LLMs more responsibly, contributing significantly to trustworthy AI. The expected outcomes, including a potential benchmark contribution and a practical toolkit, would have substantial impact on both the research community and industry practitioners."
