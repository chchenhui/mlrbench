        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of trustworthy large-scale models by focusing on machine unlearning to mitigate privacy, toxicity, and bias issues in LLMs, a specific topic highlighted in the task description. The methodology closely follows the research idea, elaborating on the integration of PEFT and gradient-based influence estimation. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and builds upon the concepts and challenges identified in the provided literature review, citing relevant recent works (e.g., PEFT-based unlearning, gradient methods) and addressing key challenges like efficiency, utility preservation, and formal guarantees. The objectives and significance sections clearly connect the proposed work to the broader goals outlined in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and easy to follow. The introduction effectively sets the context and defines the problem. The research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the proposed approach (influence estimation, LoRA-U, knowledge preservation, validation, implementation, experiments), including relevant technical formulations. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. While the interaction between LoRA-U and gradient ascent could be slightly more detailed, the overall presentation is highly coherent and unambiguous, making the proposal readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several recent techniques in a novel way for LLM unlearning. While individual components like PEFT for unlearning (Fast-NTK, S3T, LMEraser) and gradient-based methods (SalUn, MOLLM) exist in the literature review, the specific combination of gradient-based influence estimation to guide a custom PEFT mechanism (LoRA-U, potentially combined with gradient ascent) appears innovative. The focus on adapting differential unlearning guarantees specifically for this PEFT-based approximate unlearning framework also adds to the novelty. It represents a significant synthesis and extension of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm, but the proposed framework and LoRA-U variant offer clear distinctions from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon well-established theoretical foundations like influence functions, PEFT (LoRA), gradient-based optimization, and differential privacy. The methodology is logically structured, employing reasonable approximations (e.g., stochastic estimation, layer-wise aggregation) for scalability. The technical formulations are generally correct. The plan to use standard techniques like MLM and RLHF for knowledge preservation is appropriate. A potential weakness lies in the challenge of rigorously deriving and proving *formal* differential unlearning guarantees for an approximate unlearning method based on PEFT, which may require careful theoretical treatment or specific assumptions. However, the overall approach is technically well-grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current technologies (open-source LLMs, PEFT libraries) and established methods. Targeting 7B/13B models is achievable for a well-resourced research group. The methodological steps (gradient computation, PEFT, fine-tuning) are standard, although computationally intensive at the LLM scale. Key challenges include the significant computational resources required for thorough influence estimation, training, and comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks and forget sets. Achieving the targeted formal guarantees might also prove theoretically complex. While the plan is realistic, successful execution demands substantial computational budget, time, and expertise, making it good but not excellent in feasibility without guaranteed resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in AI: the need for efficient and reliable methods to remove unwanted data (private, toxic, biased) from deployed LLMs. Success would have major practical implications for regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR's right to be forgotten), ethical AI development, model maintenance costs, and environmental sustainability by avoiding full retraining. The potential to establish a standard benchmark and provide open-source tools further enhances its impact. The research directly contributes to the critical area of trustworthy AI, as highlighted in the task description, and could significantly advance the state-of-the-art in responsible LLM deployment."
