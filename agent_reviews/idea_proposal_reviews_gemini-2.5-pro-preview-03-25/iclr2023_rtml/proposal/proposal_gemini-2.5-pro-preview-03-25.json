    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the task description (trustworthy LLMs, privacy, bias, unlearning). It faithfully expands on the research idea (PEFT + influence for scalable unlearning). It effectively incorporates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning the proposed work within the current research landscape and explicitly aiming to tackle the key challenges identified (efficiency, utility preservation, formal guarantees)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The experimental design is detailed and comprehensive. Minor ambiguities exist, particularly regarding the precise mechanism of 'influence-guided PEFT module training' in Strategy A (Section 3.1), which could benefit from further elaboration on how influence scores directly guide PEFT parameter allocation or updates. Overall, the proposal is well-structured and clearly communicates the research plan."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While the use of PEFT for unlearning has been explored in recent works (cited as [1, 2, 3]), this proposal offers a novel framework (PEFT-Unlearn) that synthesizes PEFT with specific manipulation strategies (nullification vs. gradient ascent specifically on PEFT parameters) and optional refinement. The explicit integration of influence estimation to potentially guide PEFT application (Strategy A) and the dedicated investigation into approximate differential unlearning guarantees within this PEFT-based framework contribute to its novelty. It represents a thoughtful combination and extension of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established techniques like PEFT (LoRA), gradient ascent, and influence analysis. The proposed methodology, including the different strategies for PEFT training and unlearning manipulation, is logical and technically plausible. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering relevant models, datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics across efficacy, utility, and efficiency. The discussion on formal guarantees acknowledges the difficulty and focuses realistically on approximate guarantees. The technical descriptions are generally correct. The inclusion of several fictional/future-dated arXiv IDs in the references is a minor flaw in diligence but doesn't undermine the core technical soundness of the proposed approach itself."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing LLMs, standard PEFT libraries (like LoRA), and common evaluation benchmarks. The proposed experiments, while extensive, are generally implementable with appropriate computational resources (typical for LLM research). Data preparation (identifying forget sets) is achievable using existing methods or datasets. The main challenges lie in simultaneously achieving high unlearning efficacy, minimal utility degradation, significant efficiency gains (<5% overhead target is ambitious), and meaningful formal guarantees, but investigating these trade-offs is a core part of the research. The scope, including benchmark creation, is large but feasible for a dedicated research effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in AI safety and trustworthiness: the need for efficient and effective methods to remove problematic data (privacy violations, bias, toxicity) from deployed LLMs. A successful outcome would provide a practical solution for regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR's 'right to be forgotten'), reduce the prohibitive costs of retraining, enhance model reliability, and foster public trust. The potential contributions to the scientific understanding of unlearning, practical AI development, and societal well-being are substantial."
