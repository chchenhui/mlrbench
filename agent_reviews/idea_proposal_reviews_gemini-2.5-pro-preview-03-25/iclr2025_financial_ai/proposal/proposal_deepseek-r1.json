    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description (Workshop on Financial AI focusing on Generative AI, time-series, datasets, responsible AI, and applications like fraud detection), the research idea (combining diffusion models and knowledge graphs for constrained financial time-series generation), and the literature review (building upon existing diffusion models, KG integration methods, and addressing identified challenges like constraint adherence and temporal dependencies). It comprehensively addresses all requirements and demonstrates a deep understanding of the context and prior work, with no inconsistencies."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated, the methodology is detailed with logical steps (data, KG, model architecture, training, evaluation), and includes relevant technical details like equations for the diffusion process and loss function, and specific model components (GAT, cross-attention). The rationale is well-articulated, and the structure is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities, such as the exact implementation of the rule-checking module (CR) or details on proprietary data access, are present but do not significantly detract from the overall excellent clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models for finance and KG integration in generative models exist separately (as shown in the literature review), the specific novelty lies in the proposed hybrid architecture: integrating a knowledge graph via a GNN (specifically GAT with cross-attention) directly into the diffusion model's denoising steps to enforce complex financial constraints (regulatory, market dynamics) during time-series generation. This specific mechanism for knowledge-guided conditioning within the diffusion process for financial time-series appears distinct from the cited works and offers a fresh approach to constraint adherence."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (diffusion models, GNNs) and established methods. The proposed methodology (GNN-conditioned diffusion, cross-attention, combined loss function) is technically plausible and well-justified. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant metrics, baselines from the literature, and ablation studies. Minor weaknesses include the potential difficulty in creating a truly comprehensive financial KG and defining a robust, differentiable constraint regularization term (CR), which could require further refinement, but the core technical approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology (diffusion models, GNNs, standard ML libraries). Using public datasets mitigates access issues. However, constructing a comprehensive and accurate financial knowledge graph represents a significant practical challenge requiring substantial domain expertise and effort, which might be underestimated. Training complex conditional diffusion models can also be computationally intensive. While the core ML components are implementable, the KG construction and potential resource needs introduce moderate implementation challenges and risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in financial AI: the lack of high-quality, privacy-preserving, and compliant training data. Successfully generating realistic synthetic financial time-series that adhere to domain constraints would be a major advancement. The potential impact includes democratizing financial AI research, enabling safer innovation within regulatory boundaries (responsible AI), and improving downstream applications like fraud detection and risk management. The work strongly aligns with the workshop's themes and addresses key challenges identified in the literature."
