    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme. It directly addresses 'Generative AI with applications in finance', 'financial datasets' (through synthetic data generation), 'practical financial applications' (personalized planning and portfolio optimization fall under investment strategies/quantitative finance), and 'responsible AI integration'. It aligns perfectly with the workshop's topics of interest."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It outlines the motivation, the core components (GANs for data augmentation, Generative Models for planning, RL for optimization), and expected outcomes. However, the specific types of Generative Models (beyond GANs) for planning and the precise mechanism for integrating RL with the generated scenarios could be slightly more detailed for perfect clarity. Overall, it is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using GANs for financial data, Generative Models for scenarios, or RL for portfolio optimization are individually explored areas, the proposed *integration* of these specific techniques (GANs -> Generative Models -> RL) for the purpose of *personalized* financial planning represents a novel approach. It combines existing concepts in a fresh way to tackle a specific application."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Generating high-quality, realistic synthetic financial data using GANs that captures complex dependencies and market dynamics is difficult. Training and integrating GANs, other Generative Models, and RL agents effectively requires substantial computational resources, expertise, and potentially large amounts of seed data. Ensuring the 'responsibility' aspect (privacy, fairness, robustness) adds another layer of complexity. Implementation requires considerable effort and careful validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Personalized financial planning and effective portfolio optimization are crucial challenges in finance. Successfully using Generative AI to enhance these could democratize access to sophisticated financial advice, improve financial well-being for individuals, and offer financial institutions competitive advantages. Addressing responsible AI in this sensitive domain is also highly important and timely."
