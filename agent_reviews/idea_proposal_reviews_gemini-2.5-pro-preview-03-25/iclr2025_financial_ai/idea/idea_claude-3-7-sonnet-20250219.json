    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme and topics. Financial fraud detection is explicitly listed as a topic of interest. The idea addresses key challenges in financial AI (imbalanced data, evolving threats) and proposes innovative solutions (novel ensemble, dynamic weighting, XAI, active learning), aligning well with the workshop's focus on 'Advances', 'Innovations', and 'Responsible AI' (through the XAI component)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, problem statement, proposed components (ensemble learning, adaptive boosting, transfer learning, anomaly detection, XAI, active learning), and core innovation (dynamic weighting, specific integration) are clearly presented. The objectives (reducing false negatives, adaptability, interpretability) are well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of the dynamic weighting mechanism and the specific transfer learning strategy, but the overall concept is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like ensemble learning, boosting, transfer learning, anomaly detection, XAI, and active learning are established techniques, their specific combination within a hierarchical framework featuring dynamic weighting tailored for evolving financial fraud patterns in imbalanced datasets offers a fresh perspective. The novelty lies primarily in the synergistic integration and adaptation of these methods rather than the invention of fundamentally new algorithms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible. The core machine learning techniques (boosting, anomaly detection, etc.) and frameworks (ensemble learning, transfer learning, active learning, XAI) are well-developed and have existing implementations. Access to suitable (potentially anonymized or synthetic) financial data is a prerequisite, which the authors seem to have considered ('synthetic and anonymized real-world datasets'). Integrating these components into the proposed hierarchical system with dynamic weighting and active learning will require significant engineering effort but is technically achievable with current technology and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and impact potential. Financial fraud detection is a critical problem with substantial economic consequences. Addressing the challenges of imbalanced data and adapting to evolving fraud tactics is paramount. A system that demonstrably reduces false negatives (as preliminarily claimed) while providing interpretability (XAI) and continuous improvement (active learning) would represent a major advancement, offering significant value to the financial industry."
