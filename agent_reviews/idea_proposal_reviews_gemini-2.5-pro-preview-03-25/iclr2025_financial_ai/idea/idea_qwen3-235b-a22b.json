        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses several key topics of interest: 'Generative AI with applications in finance', 'time-series modelling', 'financial datasets', and has clear implications for 'fraud detection' and 'risk management'. Furthermore, by focusing on privacy compliance and adherence to regulatory rules, it implicitly touches upon 'responsible AI integration in finance'. The motivation and proposed solution are highly relevant to the workshop's theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (data scarcity, privacy, realism), the core technical proposal (diffusion models guided by knowledge graphs via GNNs), the target output (synthetic financial time-series), the evaluation strategy (fidelity, constraint adherence, downstream tasks), and the potential impact are all explicitly stated and easy to understand. The mechanism of how the knowledge graph guides the diffusion process is outlined concisely. No significant ambiguities exist."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models for generation and knowledge graphs for incorporating domain knowledge exist separately, their proposed integration using GNNs specifically to guide the diffusion process for generating *constrained financial time-series* is innovative. Applying this hybrid approach to capture complex temporal dependencies and domain-specific rules (like regulatory constraints) in finance offers a fresh perspective compared to standard generative models or simpler rule-based systems."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training diffusion models is computationally intensive. The primary challenge lies in constructing a comprehensive and accurate financial knowledge graph that encodes complex rules, market dynamics, and causal relationships â€“ this requires substantial domain expertise and data engineering effort. Integrating this KG effectively via a GNN into the diffusion model's training loop is also a non-trivial research task. Accessing sufficient real data to train the initial generator model, even if the goal is synthetic data, remains a hurdle. While conceptually sound, practical implementation requires considerable resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in financial AI: the lack of accessible, high-fidelity, privacy-preserving, and realistic training data. Successfully generating synthetic data that adheres to complex domain constraints could democratize research, accelerate the development of robust financial AI models (e.g., for fraud detection, risk management), facilitate regulatory compliance testing, and mitigate privacy risks associated with using sensitive real data. The potential contribution to both the generative modeling field and practical financial AI is substantial."
