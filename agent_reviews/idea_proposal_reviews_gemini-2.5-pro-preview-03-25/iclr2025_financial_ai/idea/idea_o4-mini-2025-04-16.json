        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses several key topics of interest: 'Generative AI with applications in finance' (using diffusion models), 'time-series modelling' (generating multi-asset time series), 'financial datasets' (creating synthetic data), and 'practical financial applications' specifically 'risk management' and 'quantitative finance'. The focus on generating synthetic market scenarios for robust risk management fits squarely within the workshop's theme of 'Advances in Financial AI' and its practical applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (underrepresentation of tail events in historical data, biased risk models). The main idea concisely explains the proposed method (conditional diffusion model), inputs (multi-asset data, macro covariates), conditioning mechanism (stress intensities), output (synthetic scenarios), and application (augmenting VaR/ES). The evaluation metrics are also clearly stated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While generative models (like GANs) have been explored for financial data synthesis, the application of conditional diffusion models, specifically tailored to generate coherent multi-asset scenarios under user-defined stress conditions for risk management, is innovative. Diffusion models are a relatively recent advancement in generative modeling, and their specific application to structured, conditional financial time-series generation for stress testing represents a fresh approach compared to traditional methods or earlier generative techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate challenges. Accessing comprehensive, high-quality multi-asset financial data and relevant macroeconomic indicators is achievable but may require significant effort or cost. Training diffusion models, especially conditional ones on high-dimensional time series, is computationally intensive and requires substantial GPU resources and expertise in deep learning. However, the underlying techniques (diffusion models, time-series analysis, risk model backtesting) are established. Implementation requires a blend of ML and quantitative finance expertise but is within the capabilities of well-resourced research teams or institutions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Improving the robustness of risk management models (VaR, ES) by incorporating realistic, synthetic tail-event scenarios addresses a critical vulnerability in the financial system. Failures in tail risk assessment have historically contributed to financial instability. A successful implementation could lead to more accurate capital allocation, better regulatory compliance, and increased resilience for financial institutions. The potential to 'democratize' advanced stress-testing techniques for smaller institutions further enhances its significance."
