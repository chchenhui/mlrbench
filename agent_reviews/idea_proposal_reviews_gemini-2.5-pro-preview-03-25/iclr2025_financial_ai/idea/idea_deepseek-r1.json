        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics of interest, including 'Generative AI with applications in finance', 'time-series modelling', 'financial datasets' (via augmentation), 'forecasting', and 'risk management' (through stress-test scenario generation). The focus on improving forecasting robustness using advanced generative models fits perfectly within the scope of 'Advances in Financial AI'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation explicitly states the problem (data limitations, GAN shortcomings). The main idea clearly outlines the proposed method (temporal diffusion models), key technical components (attention, stochastic volatility modules), training strategy (adversarial with structural metrics), application (data augmentation for forecasting), and evaluation plan (benchmarks, comparison models). The expected impact is also clearly articulated. Only minor details regarding the exact implementation of specific modules might require further elaboration, but the overall concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality and innovation. While diffusion models are an active area of research, their application specifically to financial time-series, particularly with integrated stochastic volatility modules tailored for market dynamics and adversarial training focused on structural fidelity (beyond simple pointwise accuracy), represents a novel approach. It moves beyond standard GAN applications in finance and proposes a more sophisticated generative technique potentially better suited for capturing complex temporal dependencies and volatility patterns characteristic of financial data."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Diffusion models are computationally intensive to train, requiring significant resources. Implementing and tuning the proposed 'stochastic volatility modules' and the adversarial training with specific 'structural metrics' will require careful design and experimentation. Access to relevant datasets (M4 Finance is public, but proprietary datasets require access) is necessary. While challenging, the components rely on existing deep learning techniques (diffusion models, attention, adversarial training) and are implementable with current technology and expertise, albeit requiring substantial effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Addressing the limitations of financial data (scarcity, privacy, non-stationarity) for training robust forecasting models is a critical problem in quantitative finance. Success could lead to more reliable financial predictions, improved risk management through realistic scenario generation (stress tests), and facilitate privacy-preserving use of sensitive data. This directly contributes to advancing AI applications in finance and aligns with the workshop's goal of exploring impactful innovations."
