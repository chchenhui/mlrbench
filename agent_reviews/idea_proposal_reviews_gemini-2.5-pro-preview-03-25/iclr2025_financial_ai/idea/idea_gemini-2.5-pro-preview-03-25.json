        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on 'Advances in Financial AI', 'Generative AI with applications in finance', 'time-series modelling', 'risk management', 'quantitative finance', and 'responsible AI'. The proposed research directly addresses these points by applying generative models (Generative AI) to explain algorithmic trading decisions (quantitative finance, time-series modelling), aiming to improve transparency and risk management (responsible AI)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (lack of transparency in AI trading), the core concept (generative counterfactual explanations), the proposed method (conditional VAE/GAN for minimal, realistic market state perturbations), and the intended outcome (understanding agent sensitivity, improving interpretability) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It clearly explains what the research aims to achieve and the general approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While counterfactual explanations and generative models are existing concepts in XAI, their specific application to generate *realistic market state perturbations* for *algorithmic trading decisions* is innovative. Explaining high-frequency, sequential trading decisions with generative counterfactuals that respect market dynamics presents a fresh perspective compared to standard feature attribution methods often used in finance."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate technical challenges. Implementing and training conditional generative models (VAEs/GANs) on high-dimensional, noisy financial time-series data requires significant expertise and computational resources. Ensuring the 'realism' of generated market states and defining/optimizing for 'minimal' perturbations are non-trivial research problems. However, the underlying technologies exist, and simulated trading environments/data are accessible, making it achievable with dedicated effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Transparency and interpretability are critical, yet often lacking, in complex algorithmic trading systems. Providing meaningful counterfactual explanations could substantially improve risk management, facilitate debugging and model refinement, aid regulatory compliance efforts, and build necessary trust in financial AI. Addressing the 'black box' problem in such a high-stakes domain holds major potential value."
