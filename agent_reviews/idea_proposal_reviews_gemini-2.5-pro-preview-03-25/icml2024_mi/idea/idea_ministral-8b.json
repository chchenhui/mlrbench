    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme. The workshop explicitly calls for work challenging simplistic assumptions about human feedback (like rationality) for better AI alignment, which is the core motivation of this idea. It directly addresses topics listed in the call, such as 'Human-AI Alignment', 'AI Safety', 'Behavioral Economics (Bounded Rationality)', and 'Cognitive Science'. The focus on understanding human decision-making, particularly bounded rationality, to improve AI systems aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals of fostering a better understanding of human feedback models and their shortcomings for AI alignment."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. It presents a clear motivation, outlines the main idea (developing a mechanistic framework for bounded rationality), details a logical four-step methodology (data collection, model development, evaluation, application), and states expected outcomes. The concept is understandable. Minor ambiguity exists around the precise nature of the 'mechanistic model' and how 'mechanistic interpretability' applies specifically to human decision processes rather than AI models, but the overall intent and research plan are clearly conveyed."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While modeling bounded rationality itself is established in cognitive science and behavioral economics, applying these concepts specifically through a 'mechanistic interpretability framework' to understand human decision-making for the explicit purpose of improving AI alignment offers a fresh perspective. It combines insights from multiple fields (cognitive science, behavioral economics, AI alignment, interpretability) in a relevant way. It's not proposing a completely new paradigm but offers a notable and timely synthesis to address limitations in current AI alignment approaches like RLHF."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. The proposed methodology involves standard steps: human experiments (common in cognitive science), computational modeling (established techniques exist, though mechanistic models can be complex), model validation, and integration into AI systems. Each step is achievable with current knowledge and resources, although challenges exist. Developing accurate, computationally tractable mechanistic models of cognitive biases and effectively integrating them into complex AI training pipelines (like RLHF) will require significant expertise and effort, but it is not impractical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged limitation in current AI alignment research: the oversimplified assumption of human rationality. Improving AI's understanding of human cognitive biases and limitations is crucial for developing safer, more reliable, and truly aligned AI systems. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in Human-AI Alignment, AI Safety, and the development of more ethical and user-centric AI applications across various domains."
