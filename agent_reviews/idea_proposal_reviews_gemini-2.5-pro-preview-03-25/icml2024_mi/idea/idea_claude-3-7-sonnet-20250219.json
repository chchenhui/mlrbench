        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for discussing the shortcomings of current human feedback models in AI alignment (e.g., simplistic assumptions in RLHF) and exploring future directions. The idea directly addresses this by proposing a dynamic model to overcome the limitations of static feedback assumptions, incorporating cognitive states and context, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals and topics like RLHF, AI Alignment, Cognitive Science, and Behavioral Economics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation clearly defines the problem (static feedback models ignore context/cognitive states). The main idea proposes a specific approach (dynamic Bayesian model, inferring cognitive states from explicit/implicit cues). However, some details remain slightly ambiguous, such as the specific cognitive states to model, the exact structure of the Bayesian model, or how state evolution would be precisely captured. Minor refinements could enhance precision, but the core concept is well-communicated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While modeling human factors isn't new in general HCI, explicitly framing human feedback as a non-stationary process driven by dynamic cognitive states within an AI alignment (specifically RLHF) context is innovative. Most current alignment methods treat feedback more statically. The proposed combination of Bayesian inference, cognitive state modeling, and the use of implicit behavioral cues (like response times) to dynamically weight feedback for alignment purposes offers a fresh perspective compared to standard RLHF implementations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing a robust dynamic Bayesian model to infer latent cognitive states is complex. Acquiring appropriate training data, especially with reliable labels or proxies for cognitive states, could be difficult and costly. Integrating implicit behavioral cues requires careful feature engineering and data logging. Evaluating the model's effectiveness in improving alignment also poses challenges. While conceptually sound, practical implementation would require considerable effort, specialized expertise (Bayesian methods, cognitive science), and potentially controlled experimental setups."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and acknowledged weakness in current AI alignment approaches like RLHF â€“ the oversimplification of human feedback. Improving the fidelity of human feedback modeling by accounting for context and cognitive state could lead to more robust, reliable, and genuinely aligned AI systems. It has the potential to mitigate biases introduced by misinterpreting feedback and could lead to major advancements in preference learning and human-AI interaction, directly contributing to AI safety and user-centric AI."
