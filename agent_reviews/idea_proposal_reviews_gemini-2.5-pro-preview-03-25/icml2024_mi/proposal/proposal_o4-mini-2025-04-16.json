    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem highlighted in the task description (simplistic assumptions about human feedback in AI alignment, need for better models considering cognitive factors like effort). The methodology and objectives perfectly reflect the research idea (effort-aware model, bounded rationality, Bayesian inference, behavioral data). It also explicitly positions itself relative to the cited literature (e.g., standard IRL, Inverse Decision Modeling) and aims to tackle key challenges identified (modeling effort, data collection, integrating bounded rationality)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section is logically structured (Model, Inference, Data, Validation) with clear descriptions of each component. Mathematical formulations are presented and explained adequately for a proposal. The experimental plan, including metrics, baselines, and analyses, is unambiguous. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for misinterpretation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing work in IRL, Bayesian inference, and cognitive science (bounded rationality), the core idea of explicitly formalizing and quantifying cognitive effort within a utility-based preference learning model for AI alignment is innovative. Specifically, the joint hierarchical Bayesian inference of both preferences and individual effort levels, and its application to correct for effort-induced biases in feedback, represents a fresh perspective distinct from prior work mentioned (which might model suboptimality differently or focus on data sources). The novelty is clearly articulated."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations (IRL, Bayesian methods, utility theory). The proposed model (utility with effort cost, softmax choice) is plausible and well-motivated. The hierarchical Bayesian approach is appropriate for modeling individual differences. The choice of VI for scalability, complemented by MCMC for validation, is a methodologically sound plan. The data collection strategy (synthetic and human) and validation plan (metrics, baselines, ablations, statistical tests) are comprehensive and rigorous. Minor points, like the exact functional forms for effort sensitivity \\\\lambda(e) and cost C(a|s), are acknowledged implicitly via planned ablations, but their initial justification could be slightly stronger. The VI mean-field assumption is standard but an approximation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The proposed modeling and inference techniques (Bayesian models, VI, MCMC) are implementable using standard ML libraries (PyTorch, Pyro mentioned). Synthetic data generation is straightforward. Human data collection via online platforms (MTurk) with the specified tasks (pairwise comparison, ranking) and manipulations (time limits, set size) is standard practice and achievable with reasonable resources (N \\\\approx 100 is realistic). The required expertise (ML, Bayesian methods, cognitive science, experimental design) is typical for an ML research setting. Potential risks (data quality, effect size, model mismatch) are present but appear manageable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged limitation in current AI alignment approaches â€“ the failure to account for the cognitive realities of human feedback. By aiming to distinguish true preferences from effort-induced noise, the research has the potential to lead to major advancements in the robustness and reliability of AI systems aligned with human values, particularly in high-stakes domains (healthcare, education). The potential contribution to bridging cognitive science and ML for alignment is also substantial. The expected outcomes, if achieved, would represent a significant step forward for the field."
