    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging generative ML and experimental biology by proposing a closed-loop system integrating computational design and wet-lab validation. The methodology is a detailed expansion of the research idea, incorporating concepts like VAEs, Bayesian Optimization, and adaptive feedback. Furthermore, it explicitly references key papers (Calvanese et al. 2025, Doe & Smith 2024, Song & Li 2023) and addresses the challenges (false positives, feedback integration, resource optimization) highlighted in the literature review, grounding the proposed work firmly within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section breaks down the complex framework into understandable components (CVAE, BO, Uncertainty Quantification, Feedback Loop, Experimental Protocol, Evaluation Metrics), providing relevant technical details and mathematical formulations where necessary (e.g., ELBO loss, GP formulation, EI equation). The language is precise and unambiguous, making the proposed research easy to understand."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced techniques (CVAE with attention, Bayesian Optimization with a composite kernel, MC dropout for uncertainty, DPP for diversity sampling) into a cohesive closed-loop framework for protein engineering. While individual components like VAEs, BO, and closed-loop systems have been explored (as evidenced by the literature review), the specific combination, particularly the multi-objective acquisition function balancing EI, uncertainty, and DPP-based diversity, represents a sophisticated and novel synthesis. It advances beyond simpler feedback mechanisms by proposing a more principled way to select candidates for experimentation. It's not introducing a completely new paradigm but offers a significant refinement and integration of existing state-of-the-art methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established machine learning techniques (VAEs, GPs, BO) and statistical methods (DPP, MC dropout). The rationale for combining these methods is logical and well-justified for the problem of adaptive experimental design. The mathematical formulations presented appear correct and appropriate for the described methods. The proposed experimental validation plan uses standard biochemical assays suitable for the target protein properties. The methodology is detailed, demonstrating a strong theoretical and practical foundation. The reliance on recent literature further strengthens its soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The computational components (CVAE, BO, GP, DPP) are achievable with current ML tools, although their integration into a seamless closed-loop system requires significant engineering effort. The experimental plan (expression, purification, assays for 100 candidates per round) is standard but demanding in terms of resources and time, potentially requiring high-throughput capabilities. Key risks include the complexity of tuning the integrated system (especially the acquisition function weights) and the potential for slow experimental turnaround times impacting the closed-loop efficiency. The ambitious 80% efficiency gain target also adds uncertainty."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in biomolecular design: the inefficient exploration of vast sequence spaces and the gap between computational prediction and experimental validation. Developing an effective closed-loop system that optimizes experimental resource allocation would be a major advancement, potentially accelerating the discovery of novel proteins for therapeutic, industrial, and research purposes. The framework's potential to reduce costs, improve model accuracy through feedback, and generate fundamental insights into sequence-function relationships gives it substantial scientific and practical impact potential, aligning perfectly with the goals of the GEM workshop."
