    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging generative ML and experimental biology by proposing a closed-loop system integrating a VAE, Bayesian Optimization, and wet-lab feedback. This perfectly matches the research idea's focus on adaptive design space exploration. Furthermore, the proposal explicitly tackles key challenges identified in the literature review (e.g., high false positives, feedback integration, exploration/exploitation balance) and positions itself appropriately within the recent advancements cited (e.g., VAEs with feedback, BO for protein engineering)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and easy to understand. The methodology is presented logically, detailing the VAE architecture, the surrogate model, the acquisition function (with equation), and the closed-loop algorithm (with pseudocode). The experimental design, evaluation metrics, and baselines are specific and clearly articulated. While minor details about specific model implementations (e.g., deep kernel specifics) could be elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the core components (VAEs, Bayesian Optimization, closed-loop feedback) have been explored individually or in similar combinations in recent literature (as acknowledged by citations like Johnson & Williams, 2024; Doe & Smith, 2024; Chen & Brown, 2025), the specific integration proposed, including the VAE fine-tuning strategy, the GP/DKL surrogate, the UCB-like acquisition function with a Hamming distance diversity term, and the planned experimental validation on specific targets, offers a novel synthesis and practical implementation. It represents a timely application and refinement of existing concepts rather than a fundamentally groundbreaking approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (VAEs, GPs/DKLs, Bayesian Optimization). The mathematical formulations for the VAE (ELBO) and the acquisition function are correct and clearly presented. The proposed closed-loop algorithm is logical and well-structured. The experimental design is detailed, including specific case studies, controls (baselines), replication, and relevant evaluation metrics. The plan for statistical validation using bootstrapping further strengthens the rigor. The approach is well-justified and grounded in recent literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The computational methods (VAEs, BO, GPs) rely on standard ML techniques with available software libraries. The experimental assays mentioned (microfluidics, yeast display) are established, although they require specialized expertise and equipment. The proposed scale (T=5 rounds, k=50 batch size) and estimated budget seem realistic for a focused research project. The reliance on an initial dataset (~10k) is reasonable. The main challenges lie in the successful integration of computational and experimental workflows and ensuring the models adapt effectively, but the plan appears practical and the risks manageable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical bottleneck in protein engineering: the efficient navigation of vast sequence spaces constrained by expensive wet-lab experiments. By aiming to significantly reduce experimental assays (â‰¥80%) and accelerate discovery, the research has the potential for major advancements in designing novel proteins for medicine and industry. The development and open-sourcing of a validated closed-loop framework would provide a valuable tool for the broader biomolecular design community, aligning perfectly with the goals of the GEM workshop and potentially leading to transformative changes in the field."
