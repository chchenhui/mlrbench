        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core goal of the GEM workshop, which is to bridge the gap between generative ML and experimental biology for biomolecular design. The proposal explicitly outlines an integrated framework combining generative models with high-throughput wet-lab experiments in a closed loop, fitting perfectly under the workshop topics like 'Adaptive experimental design' and the 'experimental track'. It emphasizes accelerating discovery through experimental integration, moving beyond purely 'in silico' benchmarks, which aligns with the workshop's motivation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation highlights a specific bottleneck (design-test gap). The main idea clearly outlines the components (generative model, experiments, guiding mechanism) and their interaction within an active learning loop. Examples of potential models (VAE, diffusion) and guiding mechanisms (BO, RL) are provided, adding concreteness. The expected outcome and potential impact are explicitly stated and easy to understand. There are no significant ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like generative models for proteins, active learning, and high-throughput screening exist, their proposed integration into a closed-loop system specifically for optimizing protein function using experimental feedback to adaptively guide the generative process is innovative. It moves beyond static generation or simple screening by creating a dynamic learning system that iteratively refines designs based on real-world experimental data. This specific combination and application represent a fresh approach to tackling the protein engineering challenge."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily on the experimental side. Generative models and optimization algorithms are computationally feasible. However, the high-throughput synthesis and functional assaying of protein variants can be resource-intensive, time-consuming, and technically complex, depending heavily on the specific protein target and assay availability. Integrating the computational and experimental workflows smoothly requires substantial infrastructure and interdisciplinary expertise. While challenging, it is achievable with appropriate resources and collaboration, making it a good fit for ambitious research projects."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Efficient protein engineering is critical for developing new therapeutics (e.g., antibodies), industrial catalysts (enzymes), and other biotechnological solutions. The proposed approach directly targets a major bottleneck â€“ the slow and costly design-build-test cycle. Success would dramatically accelerate the discovery and optimization of functional proteins, potentially leading to major advancements in medicine, biotechnology, and synthetic biology. It addresses a critical problem with high potential rewards."
