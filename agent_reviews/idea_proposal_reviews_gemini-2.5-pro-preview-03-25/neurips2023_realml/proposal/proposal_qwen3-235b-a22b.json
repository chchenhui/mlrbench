    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging the gap between theoretical active learning (Bayesian Optimization) and real-world applications (materials discovery) by integrating domain knowledge (physics constraints). It elaborates precisely on the research idea (PC-BO integrating constraints into surrogate and acquisition function) and positions itself clearly within the context of the provided literature, citing relevant recent works and aiming to address identified challenges like systematic integration of multi-faceted constraints."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed and measurable. The methodology section provides specific details on the techniques (constrained GPs with SIREN kernels, likelihood penalties, PC-EI formulation, SQP optimization), data sources, and experimental design (baselines, metrics, ablations). The structure is logical, flowing from motivation to methods and expected outcomes. The language is precise and technical, making the proposal immediately understandable to an expert audience."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the general concept of physics-constrained BO exists in the recent literature (as shown in the review), this proposal suggests a more systematic and comprehensive approach by integrating multiple, diverse constraints (equality, inequality from different physics domains) into *both* the GP surrogate (via specific kernel modifications like SIREN and likelihood penalties) and the acquisition function (via probabilistic safety scores) simultaneously. The specific combination and systematic application of these techniques, along with the aim for a modular framework, offers a fresh perspective compared to prior work which often focused on isolated constraints or heuristic penalties."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations (BO, GPs) and incorporates recent advances in constrained ML. The proposed methods (SIREN kernel for hard constraints, likelihood penalty for soft constraints, probabilistic safety factor in EI, variational inference) are appropriate and technically justified. The mathematical formulations presented are clear and appear correct. The acknowledgment of scalability as a challenge (Objective 3) and the plan to address it add to the rigor. Minor uncertainties exist regarding the empirical performance of the specific SIREN kernel adaptation and the optimization scalability, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing ML libraries (GPyTorch, Ax) and standard optimization techniques. The use of simulated data initially, augmented by real-world datasets, is a practical approach. Implementing the proposed constrained GP models and acquisition functions requires significant expertise but is achievable within the current state-of-the-art. The main challenge identified is scalability to high dimensions (10-100D), which is explicitly targeted as a research objective. While ambitious, the plan appears realistic with manageable risks, especially given the focus on specific materials systems."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in materials discovery â€“ the inefficiency caused by exploring physically implausible candidates. Successfully developing PC-BO could lead to substantial reductions in experimental cost and time, accelerating the discovery of novel materials for important applications (energy, sustainability). The potential contributions (systematic constraint integration, modular framework, benchmarks) are valuable for both materials science and ML. The work also has broader implications for integrating domain knowledge into active learning in other scientific fields."
