    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on real-world active learning for materials design, integrating domain knowledge (physics), multi-fidelity methods, and efficient exploration. It expands logically on the core research idea of physics-constrained BO by adding adaptive and incremental learning components. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and builds upon the recent works cited in the literature review (Smith et al., Kim et al., Patel et al., Brown et al., Adams et al.), positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape and addressing identified challenges like constraint modeling and exploration/exploitation balance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The problem formulation is precise, and the methodology is broken down into logical, understandable components (surrogate model, acquisition function, incremental learning, multi-fidelity). Mathematical formulations are provided and explained. The experimental design, evaluation metrics, and baselines are explicitly stated. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the proposed work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, although it builds heavily on very recent work (as evidenced by the 2023 literature review). The core concept of physics-constrained BO/AL for materials is established. However, the novelty lies in the specific combination and refinement of techniques: 1) The adaptive acquisition function with a dynamically adjusted constraint strictness parameter (beta_i(t)) based on observed violations is a fresh approach to balancing exploration and constraint satisfaction. 2) The integration of incremental constraint learning using binary feedback within this adaptive framework adds another layer of novelty. 3) Combining these elements with a multi-fidelity strategy presents a novel integrated system. While not entirely groundbreaking, it offers innovative extensions to existing methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations of Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian Processes, and multi-fidelity modeling. The use of physics-informed kernels/mean functions and modeling constraints with GPs are established techniques. The proposed acquisition function modification is a principled extension of standard constrained BO methods. The adaptive mechanism (beta_i(t)) is heuristic but plausible and well-motivated for empirical study. The incremental learning component uses standard Bayesian updates with probit likelihood. The experimental design is robust, including relevant metrics and strong baselines from the literature. Technical formulations are correct and clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The methodology relies on extensions of existing GP and BO techniques, which are implementable using standard ML libraries (though requiring expertise). The plan to validate using existing datasets (Materials Project) and simulations mitigates risks associated with requiring immediate, expensive real-world experiments. The computational cost will be higher than standard BO due to multiple GPs and potentially complex acquisition optimization, but seems manageable for the scale of the proposed benchmark tasks. The scope is well-defined and appears achievable within a typical research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: accelerating the discovery of novel materials, which has transformative potential across many scientific and technological domains. By aiming to make active learning more resource-efficient and physically realistic (through constraint handling), it tackles a critical bottleneck in materials science. The expected outcomes (reduced experiments, improved constraint satisfaction, knowledge integration) are substantial. The framework's potential applicability beyond materials science further enhances its significance. It aligns perfectly with high-impact application areas mentioned in the workshop call."
