    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of real-world active learning and experimental design, specifically focusing on materials design and domain-knowledge integration (physics constraints), which are highlighted topics. The proposal meticulously follows the research idea, elaborating on the PC-BO framework, physics-informed surrogates, and modified acquisition functions. It also clearly builds upon and acknowledges the context provided by the recent literature review, aiming to tackle the challenges identified therein."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow, progressing from the problem statement to the proposed solution and its evaluation. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise mathematical formulation of constraints within the models or acquisition functions, but the overall concept and plan are immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The proposal's novelty is significantly limited by the provided literature review. All ten cited papers are from 2023 and cover topics extremely close, if not identical, to the proposal's core idea (Physics-Informed BO, Constrained GPs, Active Learning with Physical Constraints for materials discovery). The proposal aims to develop and evaluate a PC-BO framework using techniques (constrained surrogates, modified acquisition functions) that appear to be actively published and explored in the very recent literature cited. While the specific implementation or combination might have minor novel aspects, the fundamental concept lacks originality based on the provided context. The proposal does not sufficiently differentiate its contribution from this recent body of work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established methodologies like Bayesian Optimization, Active Learning, and Gaussian Processes. The approach of incorporating physics constraints via informed surrogate models (Constrained GPs) or modified acquisition functions is technically sound and recognized in the field, as supported by the literature review. The proposed evaluation metrics (acceleration, cost efficiency, physical plausibility, generalization) are appropriate. Mentioning collaboration with domain experts further strengthens the soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core techniques (BO, GPs, active learning) are standard, although implementing constrained versions requires specific expertise. Accessing materials databases is common practice, though data quality/availability can be a challenge (acknowledged in the literature review). The plan is realistic, outlining clear steps. Potential challenges include the computational cost of constrained models and the accurate mathematical representation of complex physical laws, but these seem manageable within a research project context, assuming necessary computational resources and expertise are available."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: accelerating the discovery of novel materials, which has wide-ranging impacts across science and engineering. By focusing on integrating physical constraints to improve efficiency and ensure the validity of discovered materials, the research has the potential for substantial impact, reducing experimental costs and time. The alignment with real-world applications like materials science makes it highly relevant, and the potential extension to other domains (drug discovery, protein design) further underscores its significance."
