        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key workshop topics, including 'Diffusion Models and Decision Making' (specifically for RL and robotic control), 'Sample Efficiency in Decision Making' (by trading reward labels for unlabeled data), and 'Exploration in Decision Making' (using generative models for sparse reward settings). It explicitly proposes using pre-trained diffusion models to provide priors and guide exploration, tackling tentative research questions posed in the task description regarding diffusion models for sample efficiency and solving sparse reward tasks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (sparse rewards challenge), the core mechanism (pre-trained diffusion model generating novel plausible sequences for intrinsic reward), and the goal (improved exploration and sample efficiency) are clearly explained. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact method for measuring alignment between agent states and generated sequences, the specifics of ensuring novelty in generated sequences, and the nature of the pre-training data, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using generative models for exploration or intrinsic motivation isn't entirely new, the specific approach of leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model to generate *plausible future state sequences* as targets for an intrinsic reward signal in sparse reward RL appears innovative. It proposes a distinct mechanism compared to using diffusion models purely as world models or goal generators, focusing on guiding exploration through the learned manifold of plausible dynamics. This represents a fresh combination and application of existing techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Pre-training diffusion models on state trajectories requires substantial datasets, which might be difficult to obtain depending on the 'related domains'. Both pre-training and generating sequences during RL training are computationally intensive. Defining and efficiently computing the 'alignment' metric for the intrinsic reward requires careful design. While the components (diffusion models, RL, intrinsic rewards) are established, integrating them effectively and scaling the approach to complex environments demands considerable engineering effort and computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Efficient exploration in sparse reward settings remains a critical bottleneck in reinforcement learning, particularly for complex tasks like robotic manipulation. If successful, using powerful generative models like diffusion models to provide structural priors and guide exploration could lead to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and the ability to solve long-horizon problems currently intractable for many RL methods. It addresses a core challenge in the field with a promising approach."
