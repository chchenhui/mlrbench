        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on using generative models (specifically diffusion models) to enhance decision-making, particularly for improving exploration and sample efficiency in sparse reward settings. The proposal meticulously elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the dual-phase system and intrinsic reward mechanism. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, referencing relevant concepts (diffusion for rewards/planning/sample efficiency) and acknowledging key challenges identified in the review (sample efficiency, exploration, integration challenges, computational cost). The research objectives directly tackle the tentative research questions posed in the task description regarding pre-trained generative models for solving long-horizon, sparse reward tasks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-defined, and highly understandable. The objectives, methodology (including the dual-phase approach and algorithmic components like the novelty measure and policy optimization), experimental design (benchmarks, baselines, metrics, ablations), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and precisely. Mathematical formulations for the diffusion loss and intrinsic reward are provided, enhancing clarity. The structure is logical and easy to follow. A minor point for improvement could be slightly more detail on the exact mechanism for generating the target sequence conditioned on the current state, but the overall concept remains exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the use of generative models in RL is explored in the literature (e.g., for reward learning, offline data augmentation, planning), the specific proposed mechanism appears novel. It leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to generate plausible *future* state sequences from the *current* state, using alignment (cosine distance) with these sequences as an intrinsic reward signal for *online exploration* in sparse reward settings. This differs from using diffusion models to learn reward functions from demonstrations, augment offline datasets, or act as direct policy components. The novelty lies in this specific formulation of diffusion-guided intrinsic motivation for exploration, offering a fresh perspective distinct from the cited prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (diffusion models, RL, intrinsic motivation) and established methods. The methodology, including the dual-phase training and the integration of intrinsic rewards into standard RL algorithms (SAC/PPO), is logical and well-justified. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges like distribution shift and computational complexity, indicating technical awareness. Minor uncertainties might exist regarding the optimal choice of the alignment metric (cosine distance vs. others) and the precise implementation of conditional trajectory generation, but the overall approach is robust and technically well-grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but presents moderate implementation challenges. Training large diffusion models requires significant computational resources (acknowledged: 4x A100 GPUs, potentially large datasets) which might not be universally available. Integrating the diffusion model inference efficiently into the RL loop (potentially needed at every step) could pose computational bottlenecks during training, impacting wall-clock time. Acquiring or generating suitable large-scale trajectory data for pre-training is another potential hurdle. While mitigation strategies for computational cost and distribution shift are mentioned, their effectiveness adds some uncertainty. Overall, the plan is realistic but requires substantial resources and careful engineering."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and persistent challenge of exploration in sparse reward reinforcement learning, a major bottleneck limiting RL's application in complex, real-world domains like robotics. By proposing a method to improve sample efficiency and exploration using priors from unlabeled data via diffusion models, the research has the potential to lead to major advancements. Successful execution could significantly broaden the applicability of RL, reduce training costs, and enable agents to tackle more complex tasks. The anticipated theoretical contributions (generative guidance framework) and practical implications (robotics, gaming, science) are substantial and clearly articulated."
