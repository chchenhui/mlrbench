    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on combining diffusion models and decision-making (RL) to enhance sample efficiency and exploration, particularly in sparse reward settings. The core idea of using diffusion-generated plausible future states as intrinsic goals perfectly matches the research idea provided. The proposal effectively situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant recent works (Huang et al. 2023, Black et al. 2023, Janner 2023, Zhu et al. 2023, etc.) and explicitly differentiating its approach. It directly tackles the tentative research questions posed in the task description regarding how pre-trained generative models can help solve long-horizon, sparse reward tasks by providing an informative learning signal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to specific objectives, detailed methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. The DGE framework, including the two phases (pre-training and RL integration), is explained precisely. Key components like the diffusion model architecture, training objective, intrinsic reward calculation, and the overall algorithm loop are articulated clearly. The research objectives and evaluation plan are specific and unambiguous. While minor details like optimal goal selection from generated trajectories could be further elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using generative models in RL or for intrinsic motivation is not entirely new, the specific approach of leveraging a pre-trained *diffusion model* to generate *plausible future state sequences* to serve as *intrinsic goals* for exploration in sparse reward RL is a novel contribution. The proposal clearly distinguishes this from related work cited in the literature review, such as using diffusion models for reward learning, policy representation, direct policy optimization, or offline data augmentation. The novelty lies in the specific mechanism proposed for guiding exploration based on diffusion-learned priors of plausible dynamics."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations in RL (SAC/PPO, intrinsic motivation) and generative modeling (diffusion models). The rationale for using diffusion models to capture plausible state sequences and guide exploration is logical and well-argued. The proposed methodology, including the two-phase structure, diffusion model training, and intrinsic reward mechanism, is technically coherent. The mathematical formulations presented for the diffusion process and loss are standard and appear correct. Potential challenges, such as the dependence on pre-training data quality and the computational cost of sampling, are acknowledged implicitly or are standard research risks rather than fundamental flaws in the approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current machine learning techniques and computational resources, but presents moderate implementation challenges. Training diffusion models, especially on sequential data, can be computationally intensive and require significant tuning. Integrating the diffusion model sampling process efficiently into the RL loop (potentially requiring frequent sampling) could be a bottleneck. Collecting a sufficiently large and diverse dataset of unlabeled trajectories for pre-training might also require considerable effort depending on the chosen environments. While the experimental plan uses standard benchmarks and metrics, the overall implementation complexity is higher than standard RL algorithms or simpler intrinsic motivation methods. The risks associated with tuning and potential computational demands lower the score slightly from excellent."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of exploration and sample efficiency in sparse reward RL, which is a major barrier to applying RL in many complex real-world domains like robotics and autonomous systems. If successful, the DGE framework could lead to substantial improvements in learning efficiency, making previously intractable problems solvable. The research directly contributes to the intersection of generative AI and decision-making, a key focus of the workshop. By proposing a novel way to leverage unlabeled data and generative priors, it has the potential to advance RL methodology significantly."
