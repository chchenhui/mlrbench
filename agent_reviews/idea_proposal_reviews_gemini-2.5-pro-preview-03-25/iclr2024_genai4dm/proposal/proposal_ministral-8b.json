        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on using generative models (specifically diffusion models) for exploration in sparse reward settings, a key topic mentioned. It faithfully elaborates on the provided research idea, detailing the dual-phase approach and intrinsic reward mechanism. Furthermore, it situates the work within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging related works (like using diffusion for reward or offline data) while proposing a distinct online exploration guidance mechanism, and aiming to tackle challenges like sample efficiency highlighted in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The introduction sets the stage well, the methodology outlines the core steps logically (pre-training, generation, intrinsic reward, RL), and the expected outcomes are clearly stated. The algorithmic steps and experimental design provide a good overview. However, some minor ambiguities exist: the exact mechanism for generating 'novel' sequences beyond standard diffusion sampling could be more explicit, and the mathematical formulation for the intrinsic reward, while present, is simple and lacks detail on sequence alignment and handling practicalities (e.g., variable lengths, state representation). Despite these points needing refinement, the overall research direction and approach are understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using generative models in RL or for intrinsic motivation isn't entirely new, the specific approach of pre-training a diffusion model on state trajectories to generate plausible future state sequences *online* as targets for intrinsic rewards appears distinct from the cited literature. Papers reviewed focus more on learning reward functions from demonstrations, offline data augmentation, or using RL to fine-tune diffusion models themselves. This proposal's focus on using the diffusion model's generative capability directly for online, novelty-driven exploration guidance in sparse reward settings represents a fresh combination of existing techniques with clear distinctions from prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, built upon established principles of diffusion models, reinforcement learning (PPO), and intrinsic motivation. The core idea of leveraging a diffusion model's ability to capture plausible state sequences for exploration guidance is theoretically grounded. However, the soundness is slightly weakened by the lack of rigor in specific parts of the methodology. The intrinsic reward formulation is quite basic (simple squared distance sum) and might be insufficient for complex sequence alignment or robust reward shaping without further refinement (e.g., addressing sequence length differences, defining 'alignment' more formally). The mechanism for ensuring 'novelty' in generated sequences also requires more technical detail. While the overall framework is plausible, these specific technical aspects need stronger justification and formulation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML/RL technology and expertise. Pre-training diffusion models and implementing PPO are standard practices. The main challenges are practical: obtaining suitable and sufficient state trajectory data for pre-training, managing the potential computational cost of generating sequences online during RL training (which might affect interaction speed), and the significant empirical effort likely required to tune the intrinsic reward mechanism (e.g., the hyperparameter alpha, the alignment method, balancing with extrinsic rewards). These challenges are common in RL research and seem manageable, making the project generally realistic."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in reinforcement learning: efficient exploration in sparse reward environments, particularly for complex, long-horizon tasks. Improving sample efficiency is a critical goal for making RL applicable to more real-world problems. If successful, the proposed method of leveraging unlabeled trajectory data via diffusion models to guide exploration could lead to substantial improvements in learning speed and performance on challenging tasks in robotics, game playing, and other domains. It directly tackles a key challenge highlighted in the task description and literature, promising impactful contributions."
