        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly focuses on 'Agentic AI for Science' with key themes including 'hypothesis generation, comprehension, quantification, and validation'. The idea directly addresses the critical need for 'robust tools and methods for validating AI outputs' and 'trustworthiness', which are central points in the workshop's mission and call. It fits squarely within Thrust 2 ('Theoretical foundation for scientific agentic AI', specifically mentioning validation, quantification, benchmarks, and hallucination) and Thrust 4 ('Open problems and challenges', including validation and reproducibility). The proposed multi-agent approach also aligns with Thrust 1 ('Design and development of agentic AI systems')."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem (difficulty in validating AI hypotheses, need for trustworthiness). The main idea outlines a specific approach (collective intelligence framework, multi-agent consensus, domain-specific validators, adversarial agents, dynamic corpus, uncertainty quantification) and its goal (reliable assessment, documented rationale). The core concepts are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity, making the proposal immediately understandable, even if implementation details require further specification."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While multi-agent systems and consensus mechanisms exist, applying them specifically as a structured, adversarial collective intelligence framework for *validating* AI-generated scientific hypotheses is a novel approach. Combining domain-specific validator agents, adversarial agents to prevent echo chambers, structured dialogue for consensus, and a dynamic validation corpus represents a fresh perspective compared to standard validation methods (benchmarks, simple metrics, limited human review). It offers a new combination of existing concepts tailored to a specific, complex problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing specialized validator agents that accurately represent different scientific disciplines and methodologies requires deep domain knowledge and sophisticated AI engineering. Implementing robust structured dialogue and consensus protocols among agents, especially with uncertainty quantification, is complex. Designing effective adversarial validators is non-trivial. Building and maintaining the dynamic validation corpus adds another layer of complexity. While conceptually sound and building on existing AI paradigms (agents, LLMs), realizing the full vision would require considerable research, engineering effort, and potentially significant computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Robust validation of AI-generated hypotheses is a critical bottleneck hindering the reliable application of AI in scientific discovery, a point emphasized in the task description. Successfully implementing this framework could substantially increase the trustworthiness of scientific agentic AI, mitigate issues like sophisticated hallucination, and accelerate scientific progress by providing reliable assessments. The focus on documenting the validation rationale also enhances transparency and reproducibility. Addressing this core challenge has the potential for major advancements in how AI contributes to science across various fields."
