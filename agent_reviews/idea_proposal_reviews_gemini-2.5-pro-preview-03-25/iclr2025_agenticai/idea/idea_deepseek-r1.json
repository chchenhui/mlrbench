        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses 'Thrust 1: Design and development of agentic AI systems for scientific discovery', specifically mentioning 'Multi-agent decomposition design' and 'Human-in-the-loop agentic systems'. The focus on hypothesis generation in scientific domains (drug discovery) perfectly matches the workshop's key focus areas and overall theme of 'Agentic AI for Science'. It also touches upon 'Thrust 4' regarding multi-agent collaboration mechanisms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation, the core components (specialized agents, meta-agent, knowledge graph, human interface), the proposed mechanisms (RL for task assignment, adaptive communication), the target application (drug discovery), and the expected outcomes. The roles and interactions of the different parts are explained concisely, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the main concept."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for science are existing concepts (as noted in the task description itself, e.g., SciAgents), the proposed combination of *dynamic* task allocation via an RL-trained meta-agent, collaboration between *domain-specialized fine-tuned agents*, *adaptive* communication protocols, and a *structured human validation interface* presents a sophisticated and novel architecture. It builds upon prior work but introduces specific innovations in the orchestration and interaction mechanisms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building and fine-tuning multiple specialized agents, creating a comprehensive cross-domain knowledge graph, developing robust adaptive communication, training an effective RL meta-agent for complex scientific task decomposition, and designing a seamless human-expert interface are all demanding tasks. Access to diverse datasets and substantial computational resources would be necessary. While the individual components exist, their integration at this scale and complexity makes implementation non-trivial, requiring considerable effort and potentially specific breakthroughs in multi-agent coordination or RL for scientific tasks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the challenge of cross-domain scientific discovery is critical for tackling complex problems like drug discovery. An AI framework that can effectively integrate expertise from different fields to generate novel hypotheses could dramatically accelerate scientific progress. The emphasis on human-AI collaboration also addresses important aspects of trust and validation in AI-driven science, aligning with the workshop's broader goals. Success could lead to major advancements and be applicable across various scientific disciplines."
