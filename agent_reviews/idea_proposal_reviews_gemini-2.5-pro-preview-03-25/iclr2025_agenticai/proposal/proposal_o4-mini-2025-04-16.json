    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Agentic AI for Science' focusing on hypothesis generation (Thrust 1). It incorporates key elements mentioned in the task, such as multi-agent decomposition, human-in-the-loop systems, theoretical foundations (game theory - Thrust 2), practical application via domain specialization (Thrust 3), and tackles open challenges like multi-agent collaboration and knowledge integration (Thrust 4). The methodology clearly builds upon the research idea's concept of specialized agents, a dynamic knowledge graph, and game-theoretic coordination. Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to extend the cited literature (AstroAgents, VirSci, SciAgents, MATRL) by addressing identified challenges like coordination, fine-tuning, and balancing cooperation/divergence."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected impact. The core components (agents, DKG, orchestrator) and their intended functions are well-defined. The research objectives are specific and measurable. However, some technical details could be slightly more precise; for instance, the exact mathematical formulations for 'Uncertainty', 'Novelty', 'LogicalCoherence', and 'Divergence' within the scoring and utility functions are described conceptually but lack full mathematical specification. Despite these minor points needing elaboration during implementation, the overall proposal is easily understandable and presents a coherent research plan."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing work in multi-agent systems for science (AstroAgents, SciAgents) and leveraging known techniques (LLMs, KGs, RAG), it introduces several novel aspects. The specific decomposition into Domain Explorer, Knowledge Retriever, Reasoning Engine, and Experimental Validator agents is tailored for the hypothesis pipeline. The core novelty lies in the proposed coordination mechanism: explicitly using game-theoretic utility functions optimized via trust-region methods (MATRL) to dynamically balance cooperation and *divergence* among agents. This sophisticated coordination, combined with the integrated Experimental Validator for cost/feasibility and the specific human-in-the-loop (RLHF) integration for tuning, distinguishes it significantly from the cited prior work, offering a fresh perspective on automated scientific discovery."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established theoretical concepts (multi-agent systems, knowledge graphs, LLMs, RAG, CoT, game theory, RLHF) and proposes using well-regarded methods (MATRL for coordination, standard KG/retrieval techniques). The methodology is generally well-defined, and the evaluation plan includes appropriate metrics, baselines, and statistical analysis. The use of MATRL provides a theoretical basis for the coordination mechanism's convergence properties. Minor weaknesses include the lack of precise mathematical definitions for some scoring components within the utility functions, which would be crucial for implementation but is acceptable at the proposal stage. The successful integration of symbolic reasoning with LLM methods over a dynamic graph remains a complex challenge but is conceptually sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It relies on integrating multiple complex components: specialized fine-tuned LLM agents, a dynamic knowledge graph, sophisticated game-theoretic multi-agent RL (MATRL), retrieval systems, and an RLHF pipeline. This integration requires substantial engineering effort and expertise. Furthermore, it necessitates significant computational resources (multi-GPU clusters), access to large, curated domain-specific datasets (chemistry, genetics), and consistent input from domain experts for the human-in-the-loop component. While the individual technologies exist, orchestrating them effectively and ensuring stable, scalable performance poses considerable risk and effort. The ambition level is high, potentially requiring more resources or a longer timeline than implicitly suggested."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in scientific research: the efficient generation of novel, testable hypotheses. By aiming to automate and improve this process using a transparent, coordinated multi-agent system, it has the potential to substantially accelerate discovery cycles across various scientific domains. The focus on improving relevance, novelty, validity, transparency, and resource efficiency tackles key limitations of current AI approaches. Success would not only provide a powerful tool for scientists but also advance the fields of multi-agent systems and AI for science, potentially establishing a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration in research. The planned open-source release further enhances its potential impact."
