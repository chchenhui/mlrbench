    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on agentic AI for science, particularly Thrust 1 (Design of multi-agent systems for hypothesis generation), Thrust 2 (Theoretical foundations like game theory), Thrust 3 (Practical application in specific domains like chemistry and genetics), and Thrust 4 (Challenges like multi-agent collaboration and knowledge integration). The proposed DecompAI framework directly implements the research idea's core concepts: multi-agent decomposition, specialized roles, dynamic knowledge graphs, and game-theoretic coordination. Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to overcome limitations identified in the cited literature (AstroAgents, VirSci, SciAgents) and addresses key challenges highlighted, such as agent coordination and domain adaptation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (architecture, agent roles, coordination mechanism, domain specifics, evaluation plan), and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The use of specific agent names (DE, KR, IR, VP) and the description of the GKG enhance clarity. The game-theoretic approach is explained with utility functions and a negotiation process outline. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise implementation details of the symbolic transformer or the GKG update mechanism, and the absence of the referenced Figure 1 slightly hinders visualization, but these do not significantly obscure the core proposal. Overall, the structure is logical and the writing is concise."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While multi-agent systems for science exist (as cited), the specific combination of (1) formal decomposition into distinct, specialized phases (exploration, retrieval, inference, validation planning), (2) the application of Nash bargaining game theory to explicitly coordinate these agents for hypothesis generation, balancing novelty, validity, and cost, and (3) the use of hybrid symbolic-subsymbolic agents tailored to these roles appears novel. It moves beyond simpler collaboration or debate frameworks mentioned in the literature (VirSci, AstroAgents) by introducing a formalized, game-theoretic coordination layer specifically for optimizing hypothesis characteristics. The novelty is clearly articulated in section 3.1."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established concepts like multi-agent systems, knowledge graphs, large language models, GNNs, and game theory. The decomposition of hypothesis generation into four agent roles is logical. The proposed methodology, including the hybrid agent design and the use of Nash bargaining for coordination, is technically well-founded. The evaluation plan includes relevant metrics, strong baselines, and domain-specific datasets. The technical formulations provided (utility function structure, joint utility maximization) are appropriate, although specific parameter choices and implementation details (\\alpha_i, \\beta_i, exact forms of N_i, V_i, C_i) would require careful justification and tuning during the research. The inclusion of mitigation strategies for key challenges adds to the perceived rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The required technologies (LLMs, GNNs, KGs, game theory algorithms) exist, but integrating them into the proposed complex, hybrid multi-agent system requires substantial engineering effort and diverse expertise (ML, NLP, KG, game theory, specific scientific domains). Access to large-scale, high-quality domain-specific data (USPTO, Reaxys, KEGG) and significant computational resources are critical prerequisites. Tuning the game-theoretic coordination mechanism effectively could be complex. The 24-month timeline is ambitious given the complexity. However, the plan is phased logically, and the proposal acknowledges key risks with mitigation strategies, making it appear achievable for a well-equipped research group."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical bottleneck of hypothesis generation in scientific discovery, aiming to automate and improve this process. By focusing on structured decomposition, evidence-based reasoning via KGs, and optimized coordination, it tackles key limitations of current AI approaches, including generic outputs and hallucination. Success could lead to substantially accelerated discovery cycles in chemistry, genetics, and potentially other fields. The development of a potentially generalizable framework and the focus on producing testable, novel hypotheses represent major potential contributions to AI for science. The emphasis on reducing hallucination and enabling open science further enhances its significance."
