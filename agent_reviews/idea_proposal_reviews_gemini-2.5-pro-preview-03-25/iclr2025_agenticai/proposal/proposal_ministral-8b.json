        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Agentic AI for Science' and its focus on hypothesis generation using multi-agent systems (Thrust 1). The methodology clearly elaborates on the research idea, detailing the specific agents, game-theoretic approach, and evaluation strategy. It incorporates concepts mentioned in the task description like domain specialization, multi-agent decomposition, game theory (Thrust 2), and evaluation benchmarks (Thrust 3). Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the provided literature review, such as agent coordination, fine-tuning, balancing cooperation/divergence, and evaluation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, multi-agent architecture, roles of individual agents, and evaluation plan are articulated clearly. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific technical implementation details, such as the exact nature of the game-theoretic utility functions, the algorithms underpinning each agent (especially the 'Experimental Validator' - is it simulation-based?), and the mechanics of the dynamic knowledge graph. However, these details might be expected at a later stage, and the overall concept and approach are presented with good clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, although it builds upon existing trends highlighted in the literature review (multi-agent systems for science like AstroAgents, SciAgents). The novelty lies in the specific decomposition architecture (Domain Explorer, Knowledge Retriever, Inferential Reasoner, Experimental Validator), the explicit application of game-theoretic utility functions specifically to balance cooperation and *divergence* for hypothesis generation (extending ideas like MATRL), and the integration of these components into a cohesive framework aimed at improving hypothesis quality and transparency across different scientific domains. It's more of an innovative synthesis and refinement rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established AI/ML principles (multi-agent systems, NLP, IR, reasoning, game theory, fine-tuning). The decomposition of the hypothesis generation task is logical, and the proposed methodology seems plausible. The literature review provides relevant context. However, the proposal lacks specific technical formulations (e.g., mathematical details of the game theory application, specific models for agents). The function of the 'Experimental Validator' agent needs more precise definition regarding how it assesses feasibility without actual experiments. The claim of 'reduced hallucination' primarily through decomposition needs stronger mechanistic justification. Overall, the conceptual soundness is good, but technical rigor could be enhanced with more detail."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current AI technologies and methods. The components (agent development, fine-tuning, knowledge graphs, game theory) are areas of active research and development. However, implementing such a complex multi-agent system is a significant undertaking. Challenges include effective agent coordination, robust implementation of the dynamic knowledge graph and game theory, acquiring sufficient domain-specific data for fine-tuning multiple agents, and potentially high computational costs. Evaluating 'scientific validity' might require substantial expert input or sophisticated simulation environments. The project is ambitious but achievable with adequate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical challenge in AI-driven scientific discovery: generating high-quality, novel, and testable hypotheses efficiently. By proposing a structured, multi-agent approach focused on domain expertise and controlled collaboration/divergence, it has the potential to significantly accelerate research in various scientific fields (as suggested by the chemistry and genetics benchmarks). Success would represent a substantial contribution to the field of agentic AI for science, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals and potentially leading to more reliable and transparent AI-assisted discovery processes."
