    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging computational and experimental biology by proposing a closed-loop system integrating generative ML with wet-lab validation. It fully embodies the research idea of using active learning to guide antibody affinity maturation experiments. Furthermore, it is well-grounded in the provided literature, citing relevant recent works (Gessner et al., 2024; Amin et al., 2024; IgDiff, etc.) and positioning itself effectively within the current research landscape by tackling identified challenges like experimental bottlenecks and model integration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology (broken down into phases and steps), and expected outcomes are articulated clearly. Specific models (ESM-IF/IgDiff, GNN), techniques (AL, RL, yeast display, SPR), and evaluation metrics are mentioned. The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the lack of specific details on initial dataset sizes or hyperparameters for the AL strategy, and the mentioned Figure 1 was not provided. However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the core concepts (generative models for proteins, active learning, closed-loop design) exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the novelty lies in the specific synergistic integration of these components: a fine-tuned PLM/diffusion model, a GNN predictor, a hybrid AL acquisition function, RL-based generator refinement using experimental data, and validation via a specific experimental workflow (yeast display + SPR). It builds upon very recent work (e.g., CloneBO, Gessner et al.) but proposes a distinct, comprehensive framework. It's not entirely groundbreaking, but offers a fresh, integrated approach to a known problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established and appropriate techniques like pre-trained protein language/diffusion models, GNNs for structural data, standard AL strategies (uncertainty, EI), RL for fine-tuning, and common experimental validation methods. The inclusion of synthetic data augmentation and uncertainty quantification strengthens the approach. The technical formulations for loss functions and the acquisition function appear correct and standard. Baselines and evaluation metrics are well-chosen. Potential minor weaknesses include reliance on predicted structures (if experimental ones aren't available) and the inherent complexities of RL tuning in biological contexts, but the overall methodology is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. It requires significant resources, including computational power (GPUs), wet-lab facilities (yeast display, SPR), and multidisciplinary expertise (ML, structural biology, antibody engineering). The iterative plan is logical, and the proposed experimental scale (M=20 variants per cycle) seems manageable. Key risks involve potential poor performance of initial models, challenges in the seamless integration of experimental feedback, and the inherent unpredictability of experimental biology. However, given the availability of required tools (pre-trained models, simulation software) and established experimental protocols, the project is plausible within a well-equipped research setting."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in therapeutic antibody development â€“ the high cost and time associated with experimental screening for affinity maturation. By proposing a closed-loop system that integrates ML with experiments to accelerate this process, it has the potential for major advancements in drug discovery. The expected outcomes (cost reduction, faster discovery, benchmark dataset) would provide substantial contributions to both the ML and biological communities, aligning perfectly with the goals of the GEM workshop and potentially leading to high-impact publications."
