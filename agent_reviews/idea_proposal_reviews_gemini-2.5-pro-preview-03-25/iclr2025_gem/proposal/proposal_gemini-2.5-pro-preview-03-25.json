    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging the gap between generative ML and experimental validation in biomolecular design. The proposed IGAL framework is a detailed expansion of the research idea, incorporating the core concepts mentioned. Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant recent works on active learning, Bayesian optimization, and generative models for antibody design ([1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]), and explicitly tackles challenges identified in the review, such as data integration and balancing exploration/exploitation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with background and problem statement, clearly outlining the proposed IGAL framework, specifying research objectives, detailing the methodology (including model choices, AL strategies, and validation plan), and articulating expected outcomes and impact. Key concepts like the iterative loop, uncertainty quantification, and acquisition functions are explained well. The distinction between generative and predictive models is clear, and the *in silico* validation plan is concrete."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the core concepts of using generative models for sequence design and active learning/Bayesian optimization for guiding experiments exist in the literature (as acknowledged by citing [1, 2, 5, 8]), the proposed IGAL framework offers a specific, integrated, and iterative approach tailored for antibody affinity maturation. The novelty lies primarily in the tightly coupled closed-loop system designed to refine *both* the generative and predictive models using uncertainty-aware AL, aiming for enhanced efficiency. It's more of an innovative integration and refinement of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in ML (generative models, active learning, uncertainty quantification) and established practices in computational antibody engineering. The choice of methods (ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF, ML regressors, ensemble/dropout uncertainty, standard AL acquisition functions) is appropriate and well-justified. The plan for *in silico* validation using an oracle function and comparing against relevant baselines (random, greedy) is rigorous. Technical formulations for AL functions are correct. Minor uncertainties exist regarding the practical effectiveness of refining the generative model with limited feedback, but this is a valid research question addressed by the proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable, particularly the core *in silico* validation part. It leverages existing public datasets and standard ML/computational biology tools. The reliance on an oracle function for initial validation circumvents immediate dependence on costly wet-lab experiments, making the primary objectives highly achievable with standard HPC resources. The optional/collaborative nature of the final wet-lab validation goal is realistic. The plan is well-defined with manageable risks for the computational phase."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in therapeutic antibody development â€“ the inefficient interface between computational design and experimental validation, which is central to the GEM workshop's theme. A successful IGAL framework could substantially accelerate the discovery of high-affinity antibodies, reduce experimental costs, and improve resource allocation, leading to faster development of therapeutics. Methodologically, it contributes to the application of active learning in complex scientific domains. The potential for high-impact publication is strong given the problem's importance."
