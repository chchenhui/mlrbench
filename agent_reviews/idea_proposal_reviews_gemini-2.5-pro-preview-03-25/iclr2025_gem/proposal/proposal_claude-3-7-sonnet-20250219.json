        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging the gap between generative ML and experimental biology by proposing a closed-loop system integrating computational design and wet-lab validation. It faithfully expands on the core research idea, detailing the components (generative models, active learning, experimental feedback). Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as data scarcity (via iterative learning) and the integration of experimental data."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The introduction sets the context effectively, objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology is broken down into logical components (computational pipeline, experimental design, implementation details) with sufficient detail, including mathematical formulations where appropriate. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the proposed work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the core concepts (generative models for proteins, active learning, antibody optimization) exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the specific proposed integration of a dual-track generative approach (sequence + structure-aware diffusion), coupled with a systematic comparison of different active learning acquisition functions within a tightly integrated, rapid closed-loop experimental validation framework for antibody affinity maturation, offers a fresh perspective. It's not introducing a fundamentally new algorithm but rather an innovative and comprehensive framework design aimed directly at bridging the computational-experimental gap in this specific application. The emphasis on the closed-loop system and efficiency comparison is a key novel aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (deep generative models, active learning principles) and established experimental techniques (SPR/BLI). The proposed methodology, including the dual generative models and the integration of affinity prediction, is well-reasoned. The mathematical formulations presented are appropriate for the described methods. The plan acknowledges the need for both sequence and structure information. Potential weaknesses lie in the inherent difficulty of accurate affinity prediction and the assumption that models can be effectively refined with relatively small experimental batches per iteration, but the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial resources, including advanced computational infrastructure (HPC, GPUs) and a fully equipped experimental lab with high-throughput capabilities (expression, purification, affinity measurement). Integrating the computational and experimental components into a seamless closed loop with a rapid (2-3 week) cycle time is ambitious and requires sophisticated engineering and coordination. Key risks involve potential bottlenecks in either the computational modeling (e.g., prediction accuracy) or experimental execution (e.g., protein expression yields, assay variability). Assuming the necessary resources and expertise are available, the project is achievable, but the complexity and ambitious timeline introduce moderate risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in therapeutic antibody development â€“ efficient affinity maturation. By aiming to create a validated framework that bridges computational design and experimental testing using active learning, it directly tackles a major challenge in applying ML to real-world biomolecular engineering, aligning perfectly with the workshop's theme. Success would not only accelerate antibody development but also provide a valuable methodology applicable to other protein engineering tasks, potentially leading to substantial advancements in the field."
