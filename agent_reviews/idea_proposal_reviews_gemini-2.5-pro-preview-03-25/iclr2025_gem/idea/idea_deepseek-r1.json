    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the GEM workshop's goal of bridging generative ML and experimental biology. It directly proposes a method ('Closed-Loop Adaptive Design') that integrates generative models with experimental feedback, fitting squarely into the workshop's theme. Furthermore, it explicitly addresses topics listed in the 'Biology track', such as 'adaptive experimental design' and 'employment of ML for biomolecular design with wet lab experimental results'. The focus on accelerating protein engineering for real-world applications also matches the workshop's emphasis on moving beyond static benchmarks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (limitations of one-shot models), the core concept (closed-loop iterative refinement), the proposed methods (generative models, Bayesian optimization, active learning, meta-learning), the validation strategy (enzyme engineering, measuring cycle reduction), and the expected impact are all clearly and concisely articulated. There are no significant ambiguities, making the proposal immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While closed-loop optimization and active learning are used in other scientific domains, their specific application as a framework (CLAD) integrating modern generative protein models with Bayesian optimization, active learning, *and* meta-learning for cross-family transfer represents a sophisticated and innovative approach within protein engineering. It moves beyond typical static or one-shot design paradigms prevalent in the field, offering a fresh perspective on accelerating discovery through adaptive experimentation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents practical challenges. The required components (generative protein models, Bayesian optimization/active learning algorithms, high-throughput experimental assays) exist. However, integrating them into a seamless, efficient closed-loop system requires significant engineering effort. The primary bottleneck is often the speed, cost, and reliability of the experimental validation step. Achieving 'real-time' feedback and efficient model retraining requires substantial resources (computational, experimental, personnel) and interdisciplinary collaboration. The proposed 50% reduction in cycles is ambitious but plausible if the system works well."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it addresses a critical bottleneck in the practical application of generative models for protein engineering: the frequent failure of purely in silico designs in experimental validation. By proposing a systematic way to close the loop between computation and experimentation, CLAD could dramatically accelerate the development of functional proteins for therapeutic, industrial, or environmental applications. Success would represent a major advancement in functional biomolecule discovery and promote much-needed synergy between the ML and experimental biology communities."
