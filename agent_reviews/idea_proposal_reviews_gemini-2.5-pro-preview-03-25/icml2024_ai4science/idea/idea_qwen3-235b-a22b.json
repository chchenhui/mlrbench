        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Scaling in AI for Scientific Discovery' by proposing a method to build scalable neural architectures that enforce symmetries, a key theme mentioned in the task description. It explicitly tackles how scaling can be done (automated discovery, hierarchical architectures, specific scaling techniques), how it changes the Pareto frontier (balancing scalability, interpretability, physical consistency), and addresses limitations of current methods (computational bottlenecks, manual encoding) by proposing a specific solution. The focus on enforcing symmetries in scientific data fits perfectly within the scope of AI for Science."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem and the gap in existing methods. The main idea is articulated concisely, detailing the core components (self-supervised discovery, equivariant subnetworks, scaling techniques, meta-learning) and key innovations. The validation plan and expected outcomes (speedup, discovery of new symmetries) are specified. While minute implementation details are naturally omitted in a summary, the overall concept, approach, and goals are immediately understandable with no significant ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While components like equivariant networks, self-supervised learning, and meta-learning exist, their proposed integration is novel: combining automated symmetry discovery via contrastive learning *directly* with the construction of scalable, hierarchical equivariant architectures using tensorization, knowledge distillation, and adaptive meta-learning-based pruning. The proposed 'symmetry-aware scaling law' and the specific use of meta-learning for pruning redundant symmetry constraints appear to be particularly innovative contributions. It offers a fresh perspective on building scalable, physically-informed models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using existing technologies and methods, but presents moderate implementation challenges. Core techniques like contrastive learning, equivariant networks, tensor operations, knowledge distillation, and meta-learning are established. However, successfully integrating these diverse components into a cohesive framework, developing and validating the specific 'symmetry-aware scaling law', and implementing the adaptive pruning mechanism will require significant expertise and effort. Access to large-scale scientific datasets and substantial computational resources would be necessary for training and validation. It's ambitious but achievable within a well-equipped research setting."

        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the challenge of incorporating symmetries into large-scale AI models for science is critical for ensuring physical plausibility, improving generalization, and enabling reliable scientific discovery. Success would lead to major advancements by enabling faster training of more accurate and robust models for complex scientific problems (e.g., materials science, climate modeling, quantum chemistry). The potential to automatically discover *new* symmetries could yield fundamental scientific insights. It directly tackles a key bottleneck hindering the application of AI in high-dimensional scientific domains."
