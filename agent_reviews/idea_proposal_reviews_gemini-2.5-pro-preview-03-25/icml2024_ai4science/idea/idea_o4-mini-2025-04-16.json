        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses 'Scaling in AI for Scientific Discovery' by proposing a specific methodology for scaling foundation models in molecular dynamics. It explicitly incorporates the key themes mentioned (large simulated datasets, enforcing symmetries, foundation model architectures). Furthermore, it tackles the core questions posed: 'How scaling can help' (efficiency, accuracy), 'How scaling can be done' (proposed 3-stage pipeline with physics-informed laws), 'How scaling changes the Pareto frontier' (explicitly mentioned in motivation), and 'Limitations of scaling and cures' (addresses computational cost and proposes symmetry/active learning as cures)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation is concise, the three-stage pipeline provides a structured approach, and the core components (equivariant attention, physics-informed scaling, active sampling) are clearly identified. The expected outcomes and benchmarking plans are also explicitly stated. Minor ambiguity might exist in the exact formulation of the 'physics-informed scaling laws', but the overall concept and workflow are immediately understandable."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While foundation models, equivariant networks, and active learning are known concepts, their synthesis within this specific pipeline for scaling MD simulations is innovative. Particularly novel aspects include: (1) Applying group-equivariant attention within a transformer foundation model specifically for MD scaling. (2) The concept of 'physics-informed scaling laws' to guide model/data growth, moving beyond purely empirical scaling observed in NLP/Vision. (3) The integrated loop of pretraining, guided scaling, and active refinement tailored for molecular systems. It offers a fresh perspective on scaling AI for physical sciences."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges and resource requirements. Pretraining large equivariant transformers requires substantial computational resources and access to massive MD datasets. Implementing group-equivariant attention layers is feasible. Developing and validating the 'physics-informed scaling laws' is a core research challenge requiring domain expertise and experimentation. Active sampling and running high-fidelity simulations are standard but computationally intensive. Overall, it's feasible within a well-resourced research environment with expertise in both ML and computational chemistry/physics, but the scaling law component requires specific research breakthroughs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Molecular dynamics simulations are crucial for drug discovery, materials science, and understanding biological processes, but are often limited by computational cost. Improving accuracy-per-FLOP by 2x, as targeted, would represent a major advancement, enabling larger, longer, or higher-throughput simulations. Successfully integrating physical symmetries and intelligent scaling could fundamentally change how large AI models are applied to physical sciences, making them more efficient, interpretable, and reliable, thereby accelerating scientific discovery significantly."
