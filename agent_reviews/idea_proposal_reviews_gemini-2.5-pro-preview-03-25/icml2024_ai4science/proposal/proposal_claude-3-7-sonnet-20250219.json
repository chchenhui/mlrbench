        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core themes of scaling AI for science, exploring how scaling helps (efficiency, longer timescales), how it can be done (symmetry-driven architecture, physics-informed scaling, active learning), and how it impacts the methodology-interpretability-discovery frontier. The methodology section meticulously expands on the research idea's three-stage pipeline. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates and builds upon the concepts presented in the literature review (equivariant networks, scaling laws, active learning for MD), explicitly positioning itself to tackle the identified challenges like computational cost and incorporating physical priors."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and highly understandable. The introduction sets the context effectively, the methodology is broken down into logical, detailed subsections (Architecture, Scaling, Active Learning, Evaluation), and the expected outcomes are clearly articulated. Mathematical formulations for the GEAT architecture and scaling strategies are provided, enhancing precision. While some technical details are dense (as expected in a research proposal), the overall narrative, objectives, and proposed methods are defined with minimal ambiguity, making the research plan easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While leveraging existing concepts like equivariant networks (Equiformer, NequIP) and scaling laws, the core novelty lies in the specific, integrated framework proposed: 1) The GEAT architecture, a potentially novel equivariant transformer design tailored for MD foundation models. 2) The physics-informed *adaptive* scaling strategy, including selective parameter expansion prioritizing equivariant components and compute-optimal training regimes derived empirically for MD. 3) The synergistic combination of this specific architecture, scaling strategy, and active learning focused on chemical motif uncertainty. This synthesis represents a fresh approach distinct from simply applying individual known techniques."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations, including group theory for equivariance (SE(3)), established transformer principles, and statistical learning concepts for scaling laws and active learning. The proposed GEAT architecture uses appropriate techniques (irreducible representations, tensor products) consistent with state-of-the-art equivariant models cited in the literature. The physics-informed scaling strategy and active learning approach are methodologically well-reasoned. The evaluation plan employs standard and relevant metrics and benchmarks for MD simulations. Technical formulations appear correct and are clearly presented."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant resource requirements. Training foundation models and running numerous high-fidelity MD simulations for active learning demand substantial computational power (GPU clusters) and large datasets. The proposed GEAT architecture and adaptive scaling algorithms are complex and require significant implementation effort and expertise in ML, physics, and HPC. Deriving empirical scaling laws is resource-intensive. While ambitious, the plan is technically achievable with adequate resources and expertise, making it fall into the 'Good' feasibility range, acknowledging the inherent challenges of large-scale AI research."

It addresses the critical computational bottleneck in molecular dynamics, a field crucial for materials science, drug discovery, and fundamental chemistry. Successfully achieving the proposed goals (improved efficiency, longer timescales, better scaling laws) would represent a major advancement. The potential to accelerate scientific discovery, provide new insights via interpretability, and establish a generalizable methodology for symmetry-driven scaling in other scientific domains underscores its high significance. The work directly contributes to the important area of AI for Science."
