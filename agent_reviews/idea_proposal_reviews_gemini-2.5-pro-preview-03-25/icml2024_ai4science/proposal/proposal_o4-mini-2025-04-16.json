    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on scaling AI for science by proposing a specific method (SDAS) for scaling foundation models in molecular dynamics. It elaborates precisely on the research idea's three-stage pipeline (equivariant transformer, physics-informed scaling, active sampling). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, referencing key works on equivariant networks (Equiformer, NequIP, Allegro), scaling laws (Johnson & Brown), active learning (White & Black), and interpretability (Red & Yellow), while explicitly aiming to tackle the challenges identified in the literature review (computational/data efficiency, symmetry incorporation, interpretability, active learning)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology is broken down into logical components (Data, Architecture, Scaling, Active Learning) with considerable detail, including mathematical formulations for the equivariant attention and algorithmic descriptions for scaling and active learning. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities might exist in the exact hyperparameters or implementation details (e.g., specifics of the scaling triggers, nature of coarse MD runs), but the core concepts and plan are presented clearly."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While individual components build on existing work (equivariant transformers, scaling laws, active learning for MD), the novelty lies in their specific integration into the proposed Symmetry-Driven Adaptive Scaling (SDAS) pipeline. The dynamic, physics-informed adaptive scaling applied *during* pretraining, combined synergistically with an equivariant architecture and an active learning loop for fine-tuning, represents a fresh approach. The specific formulation of the equivariant attention mechanism might also contain novel refinements. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself by aiming to combine these elements for improved accuracy-per-FLOP over existing SOTA models."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations, including SE(3)/E(3) equivariance principles, established transformer mechanisms adapted for symmetry, empirical scaling laws observed in deep learning, and standard active learning techniques based on uncertainty quantification. The methodology appears robust, with detailed mathematical formulations for the equivariant attention and clear descriptions of the scaling and active learning procedures. The use of standard loss functions and evaluation metrics further supports its soundness. While empirical validation is needed, the approach is well-justified theoretically."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing, training, and debugging large-scale equivariant transformers is technically complex and computationally expensive, requiring substantial GPU resources. The adaptive scaling adds another layer of complexity to the training process. The active learning component necessitates access to high-fidelity simulation capabilities (e.g., DFT), which can be a bottleneck. While the plan is logical, achieving the ambitious 2x performance gain requires successful execution of all components and favorable empirical results. There are moderate risks related to cost, complexity, and achieving the targeted efficiency gains."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical challenge of efficiently and accurately scaling AI models for molecular dynamics, a key bottleneck in computational chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery. Improving accuracy-per-FLOP by a factor of two, as targeted, would represent a major advancement, potentially democratizing high-fidelity simulations. The focus on interpretability alongside performance is crucial for scientific understanding. Furthermore, the proposed SDAS methodology, combining symmetry, adaptive scaling, and active learning, could potentially be generalized to other scientific domains facing similar challenges, amplifying its impact."
