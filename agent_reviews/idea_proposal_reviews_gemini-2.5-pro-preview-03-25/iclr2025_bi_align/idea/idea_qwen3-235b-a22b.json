        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of 'bidirectional Human-AI alignment', emphasizing the dynamic, evolving nature of interactions and the inadequacy of static, unidirectional approaches, which are key points raised in the task description. The idea explicitly mentions 'bidirectional alignment' and 'co-adaptation'. It proposes methods relevant to the workshop's scope, such as 'online reinforcement learning (RL) with interpretable human feedback loops', touching upon 'Methods', 'Interpretability', and 'Evaluation' topics listed in the call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation effectively contrasts the proposed approach with traditional static alignment. The main idea outlines the core components (online RL, interpretable feedback, hybrid architecture) and evaluation strategy (longitudinal user studies). The concepts of real-time adaptation and co-adaptation are clearly conveyed. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific mechanisms for generating 'human-centric explanations' in real-time and the precise details of the 'hybrid RL-imitation learning architecture', but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like online RL, RLHF, and interpretability exist individually, their integration into a framework focused on *real-time, dynamic co-adaptation* driven by *interpretable feedback* for *bidirectional alignment* is innovative. It moves beyond standard offline alignment or simple online fine-tuning by emphasizing the continuous, adaptive loop involving both human and AI, explicitly tackling non-stationarity, and using interpretability to empower the human side of the loop. This specific combination and framing offer a fresh perspective on alignment."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Real-time RL updates can be computationally demanding and potentially unstable. Designing and implementing effective, real-time 'interpretable human feedback loops' that genuinely aid user understanding and control without causing cognitive overload is non-trivial. Robustly handling the non-stationarity of human preferences and context in an online setting is a known hard problem. Furthermore, conducting meaningful longitudinal user studies is resource-intensive. While conceptually sound, successful implementation requires overcoming substantial technical hurdles in online learning, interpretable ML, and HCI."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current AI alignment methods â€“ their inability to cope effectively with dynamic, real-world interactions and evolving human needs. Achieving robust, continuous alignment is crucial for safety, trust, and long-term utility of AI systems. Success in this area could lead to major advancements in human-AI collaboration, personalized systems (e.g., education, healthcare), and the overall ethical deployment of AI. It directly tackles a core challenge highlighted by the workshop."
