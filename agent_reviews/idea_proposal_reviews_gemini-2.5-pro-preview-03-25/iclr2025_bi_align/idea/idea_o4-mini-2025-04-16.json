        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of 'bidirectional Human-AI alignment', explicitly contrasting it with inadequate 'static, one-way' approaches mentioned in the call. It incorporates both 'Aligning AI with Humans' (adapting the primary model via meta-RL based on user feedback) and 'Aligning Humans with AI' (empowering users via active learning queries and explanations for transparency and agency). The focus on dynamic adaptation, real-time interaction, and co-adaptation fits squarely within the workshop's goals and scope, particularly under 'Methods' (Algorithms, Interaction Mechanisms) and 'Deployment' (Steerability, Interpretability)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The core concept of a dual-agent system with a primary model and a metacognitive assistant is well-defined. The roles of the assistant (monitoring, querying, updating, explaining) are outlined. Key techniques like active learning and online meta-RL are mentioned, providing a technical direction. The evaluation plan is also specified. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of 'alignment confidence' monitoring or the specifics of the 'online meta-reinforcement learning' algorithm in this context, but the overall research direction and components are clearly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While components like active learning, RLHF, meta-learning, and monitoring user states exist individually, their integration into a dedicated 'metacognitive assistant' framework specifically designed for *real-time, bidirectional* alignment using *online meta-RL* is novel. The framing emphasizes continuous co-adaptation and explicitly tackles the dynamic nature of alignment, offering a fresh perspective compared to static or purely AI-centric alignment methods. It proposes a specific architecture and learning paradigm to achieve the bidirectional goal highlighted by the workshop."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, but presents moderate implementation challenges. Building the primary AI (summarization, planning) and the active learning interface is standard. Monitoring user reactions and context is achievable, though robustly inferring 'preference drift' or 'alignment confidence' in real-time might be complex. The main challenge lies in the effective implementation of *online meta-reinforcement learning* for real-time model updates based on sparse user feedback, which can be computationally intensive and require careful algorithmic design. However, it builds on active research areas, making it ambitious but plausible within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses the critical and timely problem of aligning complex AI systems with dynamic human preferences and contexts, a central challenge highlighted by the workshop call. By focusing on bidirectional alignment, it aims to improve not only AI performance and safety (reducing misalignment) but also user trust and agency. A successful implementation could offer a valuable, scalable blueprint for dynamic human-AI collaboration, leading to major advancements in how interactive AI systems are designed and deployed."
