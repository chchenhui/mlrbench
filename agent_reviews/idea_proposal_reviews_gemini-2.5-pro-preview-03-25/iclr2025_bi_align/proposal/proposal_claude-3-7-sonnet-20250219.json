        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core concept of 'Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment' emphasized in the task description, moving beyond inadequate unidirectional approaches. The objectives and methodology strongly reflect the research idea's focus on dynamic co-adaptation via online RL and interpretable feedback. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates and builds upon the provided literature, citing relevant works on RLHF, PPO, online learning, and alignment challenges, positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape and aiming to tackle the identified key challenges like dynamic preferences and bidirectional adaptation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a strong motivation and clear objectives, followed by a detailed methodology, and concluding with expected outcomes and limitations. Key concepts are explained well, the framework architecture is presented logically, and the algorithmic components, while complex, are described with sufficient detail (including mathematical formulations) for understanding the core ideas. The experimental design is particularly clear and comprehensive. There are only minor ambiguities typical of a proposal stage regarding specific hyperparameter choices or implementation nuances."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by focusing on the integration of real-time online learning, multimodal feedback, and interpretable explanations into a cohesive framework specifically for *bidirectional co-adaptation*. While components like online RLHF or interpretability methods exist (as shown in the literature review), the novelty lies in their synthesis to support continuous, mutual adaptation between human and AI during interaction, explicitly addressing the dynamic and evolving nature of alignment highlighted in the task description. The proposed algorithmic adaptations for non-stationarity and knowledge retention within this specific context also contribute to the novelty. It offers a fresh perspective compared to static or purely AI-centric alignment methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established machine learning principles (RL, PPO, preference learning) and relevant recent literature. The proposed methodology, including the PPO extensions for online learning, non-stationarity, and retention, represents a plausible and well-justified approach to the problem. The mathematical formulations are appropriate, and the experimental design is rigorous, featuring multiple domains, longitudinal evaluation, control conditions, and relevant metrics. Minor weaknesses exist in the need for empirical validation of specific components (e.g., effectiveness of temporal weighting, real-time explanation generation feasibility), but the overall technical foundation is solid."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building the integrated framework with real-time adaptation and explanation generation is complex and computationally demanding. The planned longitudinal user studies across three domains are ambitious and require substantial resources (participants, time, infrastructure, funding). While the modular design helps, ensuring seamless real-time operation and managing the logistics of extensive user studies are considerable hurdles. The proposal acknowledges scaling challenges, indicating awareness of these difficulties. Success depends heavily on available resources and engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in AI alignment â€“ moving beyond static methods to handle dynamic, real-world human-AI interactions. As highlighted in the task description, this is crucial for trustworthy and effective AI. Success would represent a major advancement, offering a framework for AI systems that maintain alignment over time and empower users. The potential impact spans theoretical understanding (co-adaptation), practical applications (healthcare, education), ethical AI development (user agency, value alignment), and methodology (evaluation benchmarks). The research directly contributes to the core goals outlined in the workshop call."
