        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for bidirectional human-AI alignment, emphasizing the inadequacy of static, unidirectional approaches. The core concepts from the research idea (dynamic co-adaptation, online RL, interpretable feedback) are central to the proposal. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and addresses key challenges and findings from the provided literature review, such as the need to handle dynamic preferences, non-stationarity, the role of interpretability, and leveraging frameworks like SHARPIE (#1) and insights from RLHF/PPO implementations (#8, #9, #10) and direct alignment issues (#5, #6, #7)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and logically follow from the introduction. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the conceptual framework, data collection plans, algorithmic components (online PPO, interpretability methods, hybrid RL-IL), and a comprehensive experimental design including tasks, participants, conditions, procedures, and evaluation metrics. The language is precise, and the structure is logical, making it easy to understand the proposed research plan. Minor details regarding specific real-time implementations are understandably left for the research phase but the overall approach is unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While components like online RL (PPO), interpretability techniques, and human feedback are existing concepts, their synthesis into a framework for *real-time, dynamic, bidirectional co-adaptation* with *integrated, real-time explanations* specifically designed to foster human understanding and agency within the alignment loop is novel. It moves beyond standard offline RLHF by tackling the online, dynamic setting and explicitly linking AI adaptation with human-centric interpretability for mutual adjustment. The focus on co-adaptation operationalized through this specific technical approach distinguishes it from prior work focusing primarily on unidirectional AI adaptation or offline methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in RL (PPO, POMDPs), alignment (RLHF principles), and interpretability. The choice of online PPO is well-justified, and the proposed hybrid RL-IL approach to handle non-stationarity is a recognized technique applied appropriately here. The experimental design is rigorous, featuring control conditions, longitudinal studies, and a comprehensive set of metrics covering both AI and human aspects. Technical formulations, while high-level, are conceptually correct. Potential challenges exist in the real-time implementation of interpretability methods and ensuring the stability of online learning with human feedback, but the overall methodological approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some technical challenges. Implementing stable online PPO with real-time human feedback integration is achievable but requires careful engineering. The main challenge lies in developing and deploying *real-time* interpretability methods that are both computationally tractable and genuinely useful to users; complex methods like influence functions might need simplification or approximation. The proposed user studies (40-50 participants, longitudinal) are resource-intensive but standard. Using simulated environments initially is a good strategy to mitigate risks. Overall, the project is ambitious but feasible with adequate expertise in ML, HCI, and engineering resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely challenge of dynamic AI alignment in real-world interactions, a core focus of the workshop and a major limitation of current methods. By aiming for bidirectional co-adaptation, it has the potential to lead to major advancements in creating AI systems that are more trustworthy, robustly aligned, and user-centric. The framework could have substantial practical impact in domains like collaborative robotics, personalized education, and healthcare. It directly contributes to the workshop's goals of broadening the understanding of alignment and fostering interdisciplinary work, promising both theoretical and practical contributions."
