    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of 'bidirectional Human-AI alignment' emphasized in the task, focusing on both AI adapting to humans (via feedback) and humans being empowered to understand and shape AI (via explanations). It explicitly tackles the limitations of static, unidirectional alignment methods mentioned in the motivation and task description. The methodology incorporates concepts (RLHF, RLAIF, PPO) and addresses challenges (dynamic preferences, non-stationarity, interpretability) highlighted in the literature review, positioning the work effectively within the current research landscape. The objectives and expected outcomes directly map to the goals of fostering dynamic, trustworthy human-AI collaboration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically. The core idea of combining online RL, IL, and interpretable feedback is well-explained. The algorithmic framework includes a mathematical formulation, and the experimental plan is detailed with specific domains, baselines, and metrics. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for integrating implicit feedback (e.g., eye-tracking) into the learning process and the specifics of LLM prompting/training for explanation generation and rule mapping. However, these details are often elaborated upon during the research itself, and the overall proposal is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing techniques like RLHF, PPO, imitation learning, and LLMs, the specific combination aimed at achieving *real-time, dynamic, bidirectional co-adaptation* with *interpretable feedback loops* represents a novel approach. It distinguishes itself from prior work (cited in the literature review) by focusing explicitly on continuous adaptation in non-stationary environments and the dual goals of AI adaptation and human empowerment through transparency. The emphasis on longitudinal evaluation in dynamic tasks further contributes to its novelty compared to studies often focused on static benchmarks or shorter interactions."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established methods (PPO, IL, regularization). The hybrid objective function combining RL, IL, and regularization is a plausible approach to balance adaptation and stability. The use of PPO for online updates is appropriate. However, some aspects require further justification or methodological rigor. The integration of implicit behavioral cues (eye-tracking, dwell time) into the reward signal or policy update is technically challenging and lacks detailed formulation, potentially impacting reproducibility and robustness. The reliance on LLMs for generating explanations and mapping feedback to rules assumes a high degree of reliability and controllability, which needs strong empirical validation strategies outlined. While the overall approach is logical, these specific components introduce potential weaknesses if not carefully addressed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. Implementing the core RL/IL framework is standard, but integrating real-time multimodal feedback (especially implicit signals) and reliable LLM-based explanation generation requires significant engineering effort and expertise. The proposed longitudinal user study (50 participants, 6 weeks, two domains) is resource-intensive, demanding substantial time, funding, and logistical management. Access to specific hardware (e.g., eye-trackers) and computational resources (for RL and LLMs) is necessary. While technically achievable with adequate resources, the complexity of the system integration and the scale of the user study present manageable but significant risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in AI alignment: adapting AI systems to dynamic human needs and contexts in real-time while maintaining user trust and agency. This directly tackles the limitations of current static alignment paradigms and aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on bidirectional alignment. Success would lead to major advancements in designing interactive AI systems for complex, evolving environments (e.g., healthcare, education, collaborative robotics). The potential contributions – a novel algorithm, a benchmark dataset, and guidelines for human-centered alignment – could have substantial impact on both the research community and practical AI deployment, mitigating misalignment risks."
