    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the workshop (bidirectional, dynamic human-AI alignment), elaborates comprehensively on the research idea (real-time co-adaptation via feedback and explanations), and grounds its approach in the methods (RLHF, online RL) and challenges (dynamic preferences, non-stationarity, interpretability) identified in the literature review. It successfully integrates both the AI-centered (AI adaptation) and human-centered (user empowerment via explanations) perspectives called for in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The objectives, overall research design, and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. However, some technical details lack full clarity. Specifically, the exact mechanism for hybridizing online RL and imitation learning needs more explanation, the processing of multimodal feedback is abstract, and the proposed formula for explanation generation lacks sufficient context and justification for how it produces 'human-centric' explanations. While the main concepts are understandable, these specific areas could benefit from further refinement for complete clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing techniques (online RL, human feedback, imitation learning, interpretability) in a novel configuration to tackle the specific challenge of real-time, bidirectional human-AI co-adaptation. While the individual components are not entirely new, their combination within a framework focused on continuous co-adaptation, balancing real-time updates with prior alignment retention via a hybrid architecture, and linking adaptation with interpretability offers a fresh and innovative perspective compared to static or purely AI-driven alignment methods discussed in the literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is conceptually sound in its motivation and overall approach but has weaknesses in methodological rigor and technical detail. The choice of Q-learning for potentially complex interaction tasks needs justification. The hybridization mechanism between Q-learning and imitation learning is underspecified. The technical formulation for imitation learning appears non-standard or poorly explained. The explanation generation formula is presented without sufficient definition of its terms (causal factors, probability estimation, information gain calculation) or justification for its effectiveness in producing human-centric explanations. Handling multimodal feedback lacks detail. These gaps weaken the technical soundness of the proposed methodology."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Achieving stable, real-time online RL updates, robustly integrating multimodal feedback, and generating meaningful, real-time human-centric explanations are all technically demanding. The proposed hybrid architecture requires careful design and tuning to balance adaptation and stability. Furthermore, conducting longitudinal user studies is resource-intensive. While not impossible, the proposal underestimates the complexity and risks associated with integrating these components into a functional real-time system, making its practical implementation challenging without substantial resources and further technical development."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in AI alignment: moving beyond static, unidirectional approaches to dynamic, bidirectional co-adaptation. Successfully developing such a framework would represent a major advancement, leading to AI systems that are more trustworthy, adaptable, and effectively integrated into human workflows. The potential impact spans various domains (health, education, collaboration) and contributes directly to the core goals of the workshop by advancing methods, evaluation, and understanding of human-AI alignment in complex, evolving scenarios. The focus on empowering users through explanations further enhances its significance."
