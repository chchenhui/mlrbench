        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the 'Workshop on Regulatable ML' by focusing on bridging the gap between regulatory policies and ML implementation. The proposed 'Policy2Algorithm' framework aligns perfectly with the research idea's goal of automating the translation of policy text into ML constraints. It incorporates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as using specialized LMs (like LegiLM), formalizing norms, integrating constraints, and balancing compliance with performance. The methodology follows the structure outlined in the research idea (NLP -> Formalization -> Constrained Optimization), and the case studies are relevant to the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is broken down into logical components with detailed steps. The inclusion of an experimental design with specific experiments, metrics, and baselines enhances clarity. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise nature of the intermediate representation and the specific algorithms for the mapping function (M) and constraint instantiation function (G), which are presented abstractly. Some technical formulations (e.g., L_exp) are slightly vague. However, for a research proposal, the level of detail is generally good and sufficient to understand the core concepts and plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by aiming for an end-to-end automated framework (Policy2Algorithm) that translates raw regulatory text into operational ML constraints. While individual components build upon existing work cited in the literature review (e.g., legal NLP like LegiLM, formal methods, constrained optimization like Wang et al., fairness/privacy constraints), the key novelty lies in the ambitious integration and automation of the entire pipeline. The proposed intermediate representation tailored for this task and the automated generation of differentiable constraints directly from formalized legal requirements represent fresh contributions. It distinguishes itself from prior work like Shaikh et al. (2017) by focusing more explicitly on generating differentiable constraints for modern ML training loops and leveraging recent advances in NLP."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established methods in NLP, formal methods, and ML optimization. The methodology follows a logical progression. Using fine-tuned LMs for legal text, employing an intermediate formal representation, generating penalty functions, and using multi-objective optimization are all recognized techniques. The experimental design is rigorous, including baselines and relevant metrics. However, the soundness hinges significantly on the successful development of the crucial translation steps: accurately mapping complex legal nuances to a formal representation (M function) and then reliably generating appropriate, differentiable constraints (G function). The proposal acknowledges the complexity but might underestimate the inherent difficulties and potential loss of fidelity in these automated translation steps. Ensuring differentiability for all types of legal requirements is challenging. Conflict resolution between requirements is identified but not fully specified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While individual components (NLP fine-tuning, implementing known constraints, multi-objective optimization) are achievable, automating the entire pipeline from diverse legal texts to robust, verifiable ML constraints is highly ambitious. Key challenges include: creating a comprehensive annotated legal corpus, designing a sufficiently expressive yet tractable formal representation, developing highly accurate and generalizable mapping functions (M and G), ensuring the generated constraints truly capture legal intent, and handling the complexity and potential non-differentiability of some legal requirements. The project requires substantial interdisciplinary expertise (NLP, ML, Formal Methods, Law) and significant development effort. The risk associated with the core automated translation steps is high, potentially impacting the overall success."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of AI/ML and regulation â€“ the operational gap between legal requirements and technical implementation. Successfully automating this translation process would be a major advancement, potentially transforming how organizations ensure ML compliance. It could significantly reduce manual effort, improve consistency, accelerate the deployment of trustworthy AI, and provide valuable feedback to policymakers. The development of an open-source framework and benchmark dataset (RegBench) would be substantial contributions to the research community. The research directly tackles key challenges in responsible AI development."
