    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem outlined in the task description – bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory policies – by proposing a framework to operationalize regulations. The methodology precisely follows the three-stage structure outlined in the research idea (NLP -> Formalization -> Constrained Optimization). Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant works (e.g., LegiLM, Ershov, ACT) and explicitly aiming to tackle the key challenges identified in the review, such as legal text interpretation, formalization, and integration into ML training."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a clear background and objectives, followed by a detailed methodology broken down into distinct stages (Data Collection, Regulatory NLP, Formalization, Constrained Optimization), and concluding with expected outcomes and impact. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology describes the algorithms (including pseudocode for Norm Extraction), data sources, mathematical formulations (loss function), and a comprehensive experimental design with baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The language is precise and technical concepts are explained well, making the proposal readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like legal NLP (LegiLM, Ershov) and constrained optimization exist, the core novelty lies in the proposed end-to-end integration and automation of translating raw regulatory text into differentiable constraints for ML model training. This specific pipeline, particularly the automated mapping from extracted norms via FOL to smooth penalty functions applicable within standard ML training loops, represents a significant advancement over manual encoding or frameworks focused solely on LLM alignment (like ACT) or compliance analysis. The focus on generating *differentiable* constraints directly from text is a key innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid foundations in NLP (Legal-BERT, semantic parsing), formal logic (FOL), and constrained optimization (differentiable penalties, multi-objective optimization). The methodology employs established techniques within these fields. The mathematical formulation for the soft constraints is standard and correct. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and validation methods. The primary challenge to soundness lies in the automatic, general-purpose translation from potentially complex or ambiguous FOL predicates (derived from NLP) into accurate and meaningful differentiable penalty functions; however, this is identified as a core research objective rather than assumed solved, and the plan includes studying the impact of upstream errors."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technologies but presents significant implementation challenges. Required resources (data, compute, expertise) are typical for ML research. Using pre-trained models (Legal-BERT) and standard optimizers is practical. However, achieving high accuracy in the Regulatory NLP stage for complex legal text is inherently difficult. The automated Formalization stage (mapping diverse norms/FOL to differentiable functions) is ambitious and may require substantial engineering effort and potentially domain-specific heuristics, limiting its generality initially. Creating the annotated norm dataset is also resource-intensive. While the overall plan is plausible for a research project, the success hinges on overcoming these non-trivial technical hurdles, particularly in the NLP-to-Formalization step."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying trustworthy AI: the gap between regulation and implementation. Automating the translation of legal text into actionable ML constraints would be a major advancement, potentially transforming how compliance is handled in ML development. The potential impact spans research (enabling studies on regulatory operationalization and trade-offs), practice (reducing manual effort, legal risk, and time-to-deployment for compliant systems), and even policy (providing tools to assess regulatory implications). The planned open-source toolkit and benchmarks would be valuable community contributions."
