    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory principles by proposing a novel algorithmic framework ('Novel algorithmic frameworks to operationalize...') focused on integrating explainability, fairness, and privacy ('tensions between different desiderata'). The goal of creating 'explanation-aware models' aligns with the 'right to explanation', and the inclusion of fairness and privacy constraints addresses other key regulatory desiderata mentioned in the call for papers. It aims to operationalize these principles within the model training process itself."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main idea, specific components (explainability-aware training, fairness constraints, privacy preservation), and expected outcomes are stated. However, the exact mechanism for 'embedding regulatory desiderata directly into model training' and how the three components (especially the integration of computationally intensive explanation metrics like SHAP into the training loop) are combined and balanced lacks specific detail. The term 'explanation-aware models' is used, but the proposal integrates multiple aspects beyond just explanations. Minor refinements regarding the integration methodology would improve clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While research exists independently in fairness-aware ML, privacy-preserving ML (DP), and XAI, the proposed novelty lies in the specific framework aiming to *simultaneously* integrate these three aspects directly into the training process, explicitly targeting regulatory compliance. Using explainability metrics *during* training as a constraint or regularizer is less common than post-hoc methods, adding a novel element. However, combining fairness and privacy constraints is an active research area, and the specific techniques mentioned (LIME/SHAP, MMD, DP) are standard within their respective fields. The novelty hinges on the effectiveness and uniqueness of the proposed integration framework."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Implementing fairness constraints and differential privacy techniques within training loops is relatively established. However, integrating explainability metrics like LIME or SHAP directly into the training process poses significant hurdles. These methods are often computationally expensive, and running them repeatedly within an optimization loop could be impractical for large models or datasets. Approximations or alternative, faster explanation methods might be necessary. Furthermore, balancing the potentially conflicting objectives of accuracy, fairness, privacy, and explainability within a single optimization framework is non-trivial and would require careful tuning and potentially complex multi-objective optimization techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Developing ML models that are inherently more aligned with regulatory requirements (fairness, privacy, explainability) addresses a critical and pressing need in the field. As ML systems become more integrated into society, ensuring they are trustworthy and compliant is paramount. A successful framework would provide a practical pathway for developers to build 'regulatable-by-design' systems, potentially influencing both research directions and industry practices in regulated sectors. It directly tackles the core problem highlighted by the workshop."
