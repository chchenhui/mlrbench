    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for 'Theoretical and/or empirical studies to highlight tensions between different desiderata (e.g., fairness, explainability, privacy)' and 'Novel algorithmic frameworks to operationalize... fairness and robustness'. The proposed idea directly addresses these points by aiming to quantify trade-offs (tensions) between regulatory principles like fairness, privacy, explainability, and robustness using a multi-objective optimization framework, and developing adaptive algorithms. It directly targets the core theme of bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory principles by providing a systematic methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem of conflicting regulatory requirements. The main idea concisely explains the proposed solution: a multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework integrating specific metrics (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness). The expected outcomes (toolkit, guidelines, algorithms) are specific and understandable. The concept of using MOO to find Pareto-optimal solutions in the context of regulatory trade-offs is immediately comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While multi-objective optimization is an established field, its application to systematically quantify and navigate the complex interplay between *multiple* regulatory requirements (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness) simultaneously within a single adaptive framework is innovative. Much existing work focuses on pairwise trade-offs (e.g., fairness vs. accuracy, privacy vs. utility). This proposal aims for a more holistic, integrated approach to regulatory compliance, including adaptive algorithms based on context, which offers a fresh perspective in the regulatable ML space."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Multi-objective optimization techniques exist, and metrics for fairness, differential privacy, and robustness are relatively well-established. However, integrating these diverse metrics, especially quantifying 'explainability' (proposed here via model complexity, which is one proxy but might be limiting) into a single, tractable optimization framework presents moderate technical challenges. Developing robust 'adaptive' algorithms that adjust priorities effectively will also require careful design and validation. Access to relevant datasets and computational resources is standard for ML research, making the core components achievable, though the integration and scope pose moderate difficulty."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Navigating the complex landscape of potentially conflicting regulations is a critical challenge for the practical deployment of ML systems. Providing a systematic framework, quantitative tools for understanding trade-offs, and adaptive algorithms to balance these requirements would be a major contribution. It directly addresses a core problem highlighted in the workshop call and could lead to more principled approaches for developing compliant and trustworthy ML, fostering responsible AI adoption."
