    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy LLMs, specifically addressing reliability and fact verification/hallucination), the research idea (proactive detection via internal confidence calibration), and the literature review (building upon recent works like InternalInspector, MIND, TrueTeacher, and addressing identified challenges). It directly tackles the core problem of hallucinations using the proposed mechanism of internal state analysis and contrastive calibration, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology (broken down into logical phases with specific steps and formulas), experimental plan, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The structure is logical, making it easy to follow the proposed research plan. Minor details about the exact architecture or parameter tuning are understandably omitted at the proposal stage."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While using internal states (InternalInspector, MIND) and contrastive learning (InternalInspector) for confidence/hallucination detection exists in the literature, the proposal combines these elements with a specific focus on *proactive calibration* for *real-time flagging* during generation. It aims to integrate and refine these techniques, potentially using a specific combination of internal features and leveraging methods like prompt-guided adaptation (PRISM) for generalization. The novelty lies more in the specific synthesis, application focus, and calibration goal rather than introducing a fundamentally new technique. It represents a solid incremental step building on very recent work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established concepts (LLM internal states, contrastive learning, entropy, calibration metrics like ECE). The methodology is well-defined, employing standard techniques for data generation (TrueTeacher), feature extraction, training (triplet loss), and evaluation (standard benchmarks and metrics). The experimental plan includes relevant baselines and considers cross-domain/model generalization. The assumption of a weighted linear combination for the confidence score might be a simplification, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on accessible resources (LLMs, datasets, standard libraries) and established ML techniques. The proposed timeline and research phases are logical. The main challenges lie in achieving the ambitious performance targets (e.g., ECE reduction >= 20%, latency <= 10ms/token, F1 >= 0.85) simultaneously, ensuring robust generalization, and potentially the computational cost of training/fine-tuning. However, these are research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Addressing LLM hallucinations is a critical challenge for deploying trustworthy AI in sensitive domains. Developing a method for proactive, internal confidence assessment without relying solely on external verifiers would be a major advancement. Success would improve model reliability, enhance user trust, contribute to interpretability, and directly impact the safety and utility of LLMs, aligning perfectly with the goals of secure and trustworthy AI research."
