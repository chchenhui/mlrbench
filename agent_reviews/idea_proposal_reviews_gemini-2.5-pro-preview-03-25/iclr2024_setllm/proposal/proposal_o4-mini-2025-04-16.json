        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (focusing on LLM reliability and fact verification), the research idea (proactive detection via internal confidence calibration), and the literature review (addressing identified gaps like post-hoc limitations and integrating internal states). It directly proposes a method based on the core idea, leverages concepts from the reviewed literature (MIND, InternalInspector, calibration techniques, contrastive learning), and targets a key topic of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology (including data preparation, model architecture, loss functions with equations), and experimental plan are articulated precisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow, and there is minimal ambiguity in what is being proposed and how it will be evaluated. The significance and expected outcomes are also clearly stated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing work on internal state analysis (MIND, InternalInspector) and confidence calibration, its novelty lies in the specific combination of supervised fine-tuning and contrastive learning applied directly to internal states for *factuality* calibration, and its tight integration into the decoding process for *proactive* flagging. It distinguishes itself from purely unsupervised methods (MIND) or post-hoc calibration techniques by proposing a direct, learned calibration mechanism tied to generation. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it combines known techniques, but the specific formulation and application are innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid foundations (transformer models, confidence calibration principles, contrastive learning). The methodology is well-reasoned: the data generation strategy is plausible (though potentially challenging), the model architecture modification is standard, the joint loss function directly targets the objectives, and the experimental design is comprehensive (including relevant benchmarks, strong baselines like MIND, appropriate metrics, and ablation studies). Technical formulations for the core components are provided and appear correct. The fusion mechanism for internal states could be specified further, but the overall approach is methodologically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with standard LLM research resources. Fine-tuning LLMs, implementing custom heads, and using contrastive/BCE losses are common practices. The main challenge lies in constructing the large-scale (200K examples), token-aligned dataset of factual vs. hallucinated continuations, which requires significant compute for generation and reliable fact-checking/alignment tools. However, leveraging existing datasets (like FEVER) and techniques (like TrueTeacher) could mitigate this. Achieving the targeted low latency (<10% overhead) also requires careful implementation. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable with adequate resources and engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: LLM hallucination, a major obstacle to their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. Developing a proactive, integrated mechanism for detecting hallucinations in real-time would be a substantial advancement over post-hoc methods. Success would enhance user trust, improve safety, potentially reduce reliance on costly external verification, and contribute meaningfully to the field of reliable and trustworthy AI, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
