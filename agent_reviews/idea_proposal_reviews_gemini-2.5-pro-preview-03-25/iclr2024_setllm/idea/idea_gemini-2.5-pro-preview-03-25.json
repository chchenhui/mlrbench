    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on 'Secure and Trustworthy Large Language Models' and explicitly lists 'Fact verification (e.g. hallucinated generation)' and 'Reliability assurance and assessment of LLMs' as key topics. The proposed idea directly addresses the problem of LLM hallucinations, aiming to improve reliability and trustworthiness through proactive internal detection, which fits squarely within the workshop's scope and stated topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (hallucinations erode trust), the core concept (internal confidence calibration via contrastive learning), the proposed mechanism (associating internal metrics like entropy/activations with factuality), and the goal (proactive flagging of unreliable content) are well-explained. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific internal metrics to prioritize or the exact architecture of the contrastive learning setup, but the overall research direction is clearly defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea has notable originality. While using internal model states (like token probabilities or entropy) for uncertainty estimation isn't entirely new, the specific proposal to use *contrastive learning* to explicitly *calibrate* these internal states against *factual accuracy* for *proactive hallucination detection during generation* offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond simple uncertainty thresholds towards a learned calibration focused specifically on factuality, differentiating it from general uncertainty quantification and post-hoc verification methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Fine-tuning LLMs using contrastive learning is a known technique. Accessing internal states like token distributions or layer activations is possible. The main challenges lie in curating suitable contrastive datasets (factual vs. hallucinated pairs, which requires effort but is achievable) and identifying the most reliable internal signals correlating with factuality, which may require significant experimentation. Standard LLM research resources would be required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Hallucinations are a critical bottleneck limiting the reliable deployment of LLMs in many domains. Developing a method for proactive, internal detection of potential hallucinations *during* generation would be a major advancement over purely post-hoc methods. Success in this area could substantially improve LLM trustworthiness, safety, and usability, addressing a core challenge highlighted by the workshop."
