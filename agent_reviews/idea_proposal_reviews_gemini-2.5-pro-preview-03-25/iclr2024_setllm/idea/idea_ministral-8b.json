        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly lists 'Adversarial attacks and defenses in LLMs' as a key topic. The idea directly addresses this by proposing a framework to enhance LLM robustness against such attacks, fitting squarely within the workshop's aim to discuss novel solutions for LLM security and trustworthiness challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It outlines the motivation, the core components (adversarial training, RL for defense), and the intended evaluation. However, the specifics of the reinforcement learning agent (e.g., state/action space, reward function, real-time integration mechanism) and the exact nature of the countermeasures ('input sanitization', 'model reweighting') could be defined more precisely for complete understanding. The evaluation plan also lacks specific details on benchmarks and metrics."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. Adversarial training is a well-established technique for improving model robustness. Using reinforcement learning for security applications, including adversarial defense, has also been explored. The novelty primarily lies in the specific combination of these two techniques (adversarial training + RL agent) applied directly to enhance the robustness of large language models against adversarial text inputs, particularly the real-time detection and mitigation aspect via RL. However, it builds heavily on existing concepts rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Adversarial training for large LLMs requires substantial computational resources. Designing and training an effective RL agent for real-time adversarial input detection and mitigation in the complex context of LLMs is non-trivial, requiring careful engineering of the state representation, action space, and reward signal. Access to appropriate LLMs and datasets is necessary. While challenging, it is within the scope of current ML research capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Adversarial robustness is a critical concern for the safe and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. Developing effective defenses against sophisticated attacks addresses a major vulnerability. Success in this research could lead to substantially more reliable and secure LLMs, fostering greater trust and enabling wider adoption in sensitive domains."
