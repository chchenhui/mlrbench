        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-aligned with the task description. It directly addresses a key topic of the workshop: enhancing the reliability of multimodal models by tackling hallucinations. It also aligns with the goal of exploring novel design principles that emphasize resource efficiency and sustainability, as DACE aims to be lightweight and avoid full model retraining. While it doesn't explicitly cover all workshop topics like fairness or specific security attacks (adversarial/backdoor), its focus on reducing hallucinations, a major reliability concern, and its emphasis on efficiency make it highly relevant to the workshop's core themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-defined. The motivation effectively outlines the problem of hallucinations and the limitations of current approaches. The main idea is broken down into three understandable components: the lightweight layer learning via contrastive learning, the dynamic attention mechanism, and the self-verification module. The proposed benefits (efficiency, adaptability, plug-in nature) are also clearly stated. While minor details about the exact implementation of the self-verification module or the specifics of the contrastive data could be further elaborated, the overall concept and approach are articulated well with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While domain adaptation, concept embeddings, contrastive learning, and attention mechanisms are existing concepts, their specific combination and application to proactively reduce hallucinations in multimodal models via a lightweight, dynamic, plug-in module (DACE) is innovative. It moves beyond typical fine-tuning or post-hoc filtering approaches. Learning domain-specific concepts contrastively from validated vs. hallucinated content is a fresh perspective. The novelty lies more in the specific architecture and learning strategy tailored to this problem rather than inventing a fundamentally new technique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. Implementing a lightweight layer, using contrastive learning, and incorporating attention mechanisms are standard practices in deep learning. The main challenges likely lie in (1) curating suitable datasets of validated versus hallucinated content across different domains for the contrastive learning phase, and (2) designing and implementing an effective cross-modal self-verification module. While these require careful design and experimentation, they seem achievable with current ML knowledge and resources. The claim of avoiding full model retraining significantly boosts its practical feasibility compared to alternative approaches."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Hallucinations are a critical barrier to the trustworthy deployment of multimodal foundational models. Developing an efficient and adaptable method to reduce them, as proposed, would be a major contribution to the field of responsible AI. The potential to improve model reliability without extensive retraining makes the approach highly valuable, aligning with the workshop's emphasis on sustainability. If successful, DACE could be widely applicable and significantly enhance the practical utility and safety of multimodal systems."
