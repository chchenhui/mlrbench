        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop call). It directly addresses multiple key workshop topics: enhancing reliability (tackling hallucinations, harmful content, fairness), exploring preemptive measures during pre-training and dataset curation, identifying sources of reliability concerns (data, pre-training strategies), and promoting sustainability by aiming to reduce computational demands. The focus on multimodal models and mention of robotics aligns perfectly with the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the core components (knowledge-grounded contrastive learning, dynamic dataset curation) are explained. The objectives (reducing hallucinations, improving fairness, lowering costs) are specific. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanism of the 'knowledge consistency score' and its real-time integration into the pre-training loop, but the overall concept is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like knowledge grounding and contrastive learning exist, the proposed framework integrates them with dynamic dataset curation driven by a 'knowledge consistency score' specifically during pre-training. This combination, aimed simultaneously at improving reliability and sustainability in multimodal models, offers a fresh perspective compared to standard pre-training or purely post-hoc methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Utilizing existing knowledge graphs (like Wikidata) and contrastive learning is practical. However, creating or curating a sufficiently large and high-quality *multimodal* knowledge graph is non-trivial. Implementing the dynamic dataset curation loop efficiently (calculating consistency scores, updating data/model iteratively without excessive overhead) during large-scale pre-training poses significant engineering hurdles. The claimed 30-40% cost reduction is ambitious and requires empirical validation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses critical and timely issues of reliability (hallucinations, bias, harmful content) and sustainability (computational cost) in the development of powerful multimodal foundation models. Developing proactive, knowledge-guided methods integrated into pre-training could lead to more trustworthy, ethical, and efficient models, which is highly valuable for deployment in sensitive domains like healthcare and robotics, as mentioned."
