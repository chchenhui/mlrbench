        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's call for preemptive measures ('proactive safety alignment') to tackle reliability issues like harmful content and fairness in multimodal models. It focuses on methods mentioned in the task description, specifically 'dataset curation' and 'pre-training strategies'. Furthermore, it touches upon 'resource efficiency' by suggesting the potential to focus compute on high-quality data, aligning with the workshop's goal of promoting responsibility and sustainability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (proactive vs. reactive safety) is explicitly stated. The core mechanism (curriculum learning integrated with safety/fairness-based data curation during pre-training) is explained concisely. The progression from simple/safe to complex/diverse data, along with the filtering step, is easy to understand. The intended outcome (inherently safer/fairer models) is clearly articulated. Minor details on the specific safety classifiers or bias metrics could be elaborated, but the overall concept is exceptionally clear."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While curriculum learning and data curation for safety are existing concepts, their specific integration *during* the pre-training phase of large multimodal models, structured as a curriculum explicitly designed for proactive safety and fairness alignment, offers a fresh perspective. Most safety interventions occur post-hoc or during fine-tuning. Applying this systematically within the pre-training data flow, using automated checks to guide the curriculum, represents a notable combination and application of existing ideas to address the problem preemptively."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Curriculum learning frameworks exist, and data filtering is common. However, developing robust, scalable, and reliable automated safety/fairness classifiers that can effectively evaluate vast amounts of multimodal pre-training data early on is non-trivial. Designing the curriculum stages (simple/safe to complex/diverse) requires careful consideration to avoid hindering model capability. Integrating these checks efficiently into massive pre-training pipelines also requires significant engineering effort. While plausible with current technology, it requires substantial research and development."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of ensuring safety and fairness in foundational multimodal models, a major concern highlighted in the task description. Shifting safety considerations from reactive post-hoc fixes to proactive pre-training integration could lead to fundamentally safer AI systems and reduce the significant costs associated with current alignment methods. Success would represent a major advancement in responsible AI development, directly contributing to the workshop's goals."
