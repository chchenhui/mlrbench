        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of proactive reliability (fairness, hallucinations, safety) and sustainability in multimodal models. The proposed KnoWDyPre framework perfectly matches the research idea's components (knowledge-guided contrastive learning, dynamic curation). The methodology explicitly builds upon and cites relevant works from the literature review (e.g., Knowledge-CLIP, AKGP-LVLM, dynamic curation concepts), and the objectives and significance directly map onto the workshop's goals and the identified research gap. There are no discernible inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, problem statement, proposed idea (KnoWDyPre), objectives, and methodology are articulated concisely and logically. The framework's components and algorithmic steps are explained clearly, including mathematical formulations for key losses. The evaluation plan is specific regarding metrics, datasets, baselines, and ablation studies. While minor implementation details (e.g., exact KG linking mechanism, specific redundancy metric) could be further elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like knowledge-guided pre-training (Knowledge-CLIP, AKGP-LVLM) and dynamic data curation/filtering (Anon. 2024, Anon. 2023) exist in the literature, the novelty lies in their synergistic integration within the unified KnoWDyPre framework. Specifically, the combination of knowledge-guided contrastive learning with dynamic dataset curation driven by knowledge consistency, harm/bias scores, and redundancy checks, explicitly targeting *both* reliability and sustainability *proactively* during pre-training, represents a fresh approach. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work focusing on only one aspect or using post-hoc methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, knowledge graphs, multimodal representation learning) and established methods cited in the literature review. The proposed methodology, including the architecture and algorithmic steps, is logical and well-justified. The inclusion of specific loss functions (ITC, KGC) and a detailed evaluation plan with baselines and ablations adds to its rigor. Potential challenges like KG linking accuracy and computational overhead are acknowledged as limitations, which is appropriate. The technical formulations provided are conceptually correct, though full implementation details would require further specification."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology (Transformers, KGs, standard datasets) and methods. The plan is realistic, outlining clear steps for implementation and evaluation. However, significant computational resources (GPUs, time) typical for pre-training large models are required. Key challenges include the practical implementation and efficiency of KG linking at scale, the potential computational overhead of the dynamic curation loop (which could counteract sustainability gains if not optimized), and ensuring the quality/coverage of the multimodal KG. These factors introduce moderate implementation risks but do not render the proposal infeasible, assuming adequate resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and timely challenges in AI â€“ the reliability (factuality, fairness, safety) and sustainability (computational/data cost) of foundational multimodal models. These issues are central to the responsible development and deployment of AI, particularly in high-stakes domains mentioned (robotics, healthcare). By proposing a proactive, pre-training based solution, the research has the potential to lead to major advancements in trustworthy AI, influence future model development paradigms, and contribute concrete methods for operationalizing responsible AI principles, aligning perfectly with the workshop's aims."
