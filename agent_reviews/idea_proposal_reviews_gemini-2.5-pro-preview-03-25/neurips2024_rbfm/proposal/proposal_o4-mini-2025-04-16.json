        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core requirements of the workshop task: preemptive strategies for enhancing reliability (fairness, hallucinations, security) and sustainability (resource efficiency) in multimodal models. The methodology precisely implements the research idea (knowledge-guided contrastive learning + dynamic dataset curation). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon concepts presented in the literature review, citing relevant works like Knowledge-CLIP, AKGP-LVLM, and papers on dynamic curation and adversarial filtering."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and experimental design are articulated concisely and logically. The framework is presented step-by-step, the model architecture is specified, and the mathematical formulations for the loss functions and the Knowledge Consistency Score (KCS) are clearly provided. Evaluation metrics, baselines, and implementation details are specific and unambiguous, leaving little room for misinterpretation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like knowledge integration (Knowledge-CLIP, AKGP-LVLM), contrastive learning (CLIP), adversarial filtering, and dynamic dataset curation exist in the literature (as cited), the novelty lies in their specific combination within a unified pre-training framework. The key innovation is the simultaneous optimization for reliability (via knowledge grounding and adversarial filtering) and sustainability (via KCS-based dynamic curation) in a *preemptive* manner during pre-training. It offers a fresh perspective compared to purely post-hoc methods or methods focusing only on knowledge integration without the dynamic curation aspect for efficiency."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, knowledge graphs, adversarial methods) and established model architectures (Transformers, ViT, GNNs). The proposed methodology, including the specific loss functions (InfoNCE adaptation, L2 for knowledge alignment, adversarial CE loss) and the KCS metric, is technically plausible and well-justified. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and comprehensive metrics. Minor potential weaknesses include the complexity of balancing multiple loss terms (alpha, beta) and the practical challenges of large-scale entity linking, but the overall approach is technically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial computational resources (8xA100 GPUs), large-scale datasets (LAION), and knowledge graphs (Wikidata), which are standard for this scale of research but demanding. Integrating the various components (dual encoders, GNN, multiple loss functions, dynamic curation loop) is complex. Large-scale entity linking between images/text and knowledge graphs can be noisy and computationally intensive. However, the plan is realistic given the specified resources and current ML capabilities. The risks are manageable, primarily revolving around implementation complexity and hyperparameter tuning."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and timely problems in state-of-the-art multimodal generative models: hallucinations, bias, and the immense resource costs associated with their training. By proposing a *preemptive* framework to embed responsibility and sustainability directly into pre-training, it has the potential to shift the paradigm away from less efficient post-hoc fixes. Success would lead to more trustworthy and accessible foundational models, enabling safer deployment in critical domains (healthcare, robotics) and contributing substantially to the field's responsible development."
