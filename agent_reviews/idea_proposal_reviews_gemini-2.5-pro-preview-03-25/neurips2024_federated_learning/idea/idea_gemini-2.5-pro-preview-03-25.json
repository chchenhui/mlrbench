    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Prompt tuning and design in federated settings', 'Impact of heterogeneity in FL of large models', and 'Federated transfer learning with foundation models'. The proposed idea directly addresses federated prompt generation for Foundation Models (FMs), explicitly tackles the challenge of heterogeneity, and fits within the broader scope of adapting FMs in a federated manner (a form of FTL-FM). It aligns perfectly with the goal of exploring the intersection of FL and FMs, particularly focusing on tuning FMs efficiently and privately."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (challenges of federated prompt tuning, heterogeneity) and the core concept (federated meta-learning for a prompt generator) are well-explained. The proposed mechanism (client evaluation, server meta-optimization) is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architecture of the 'prompt generator' and the exact meta-optimization algorithm used, but these are reasonable omissions for a concise research idea summary. The distinction from standard prompt averaging methods is clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While Federated Learning, Meta-Learning, and Prompt Tuning are existing concepts, applying Federated Meta-Learning specifically to train a *prompt generator* model, rather than directly averaging prompt parameters or embeddings, is innovative. This approach offers a potentially more robust way to handle client heterogeneity and generate diverse, tailored prompts compared to existing federated prompt tuning strategies. It shifts the focus from learning a single prompt to learning how to generate prompts, which is a novel perspective in this context."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires integrating FL frameworks, meta-learning algorithms (which can be complex to tune), and access to FMs (via API or local instances). Designing and training the 'prompt generator' model adds another layer of complexity. Communication costs for feedback (gradients/scores) need careful management. While requiring significant engineering effort and careful experimental design, the core components exist, making the idea achievable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the critical challenge of adapting powerful FMs in decentralized, privacy-sensitive environments using FL. Prompting is a key, resource-efficient method for FM adaptation, and improving its effectiveness in FL settings, especially under data heterogeneity, is highly relevant. Success could enable more effective collaborative use of FMs, leading to better personalization and performance in real-world FL applications while preserving privacy, directly contributing to the FTL-FM field highlighted in the task description."
