        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (HiLD Workshop). It directly addresses several key areas: developing mathematical frameworks for scaling limits (width), explaining the role of the optimization algorithm (SGD bias) and architecture choices on dynamics, relating optimizer design to implicit regularization and generalization via the evolving kernel, and providing analyzable models (meta-kernel framework) for DNN phenomena like the transition between learning regimes. It fits squarely within the workshop's theme of understanding high-dimensional learning dynamics and scaling."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (disconnect between finite/infinite width regimes) is well-explained. The core proposal (dynamic, optimizer-aware kernel framework) and validation steps (spectral analysis, adaptive regularization, simulations) are outlined. While technical terms like 'meta-kernel framework' might require more precise definition in a full paper, the overall concept, goals, and approach are understandable and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While NTK (infinite width) and feature learning (finite width) are known concepts, the proposal focuses specifically on analytically modeling the *transition* between these regimes using a *dynamic* kernel that evolves during training and explicitly incorporates optimizer-induced biases. This moves beyond static kernel analyses (like standard NTK) or purely empirical observations of scaling. Using this dynamic kernel to predict trade-offs, guide regularization, and simulate phase transitions represents a fresh theoretical approach to unifying scaling theory and optimization dynamics."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant theoretical challenges. Deriving an analytical form for a kernel that dynamically evolves under the influence of an optimizer (like SGD) across varying widths is complex and likely requires simplifying assumptions or approximations. Linking spectral properties rigorously to generalization and implementing adaptive kernel-based regularization are non-trivial tasks. However, the approach builds on existing theoretical tools (kernel methods, dynamical systems theory, random matrix theory), making it plausible within a dedicated research effort, albeit ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Understanding the interplay between feature learning, linearization, network width, and optimization is a fundamental challenge in deep learning theory with major practical implications. Successfully bridging this gap could provide principled guidelines for designing efficient large-scale architectures, optimizing training, and predicting generalization performance. Unifying scaling theory with optimization dynamics via an evolving kernel would represent a major advancement, potentially impacting areas beyond standard supervised learning, such as continual learning."
