        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (HiLD workshop). It directly addresses multiple key areas outlined in the call: developing analyzable models and dynamics for DNN phenomena (dynamical systems model), creating mathematical frameworks for scaling limits (infinite-width limit), explaining the role of optimizers, hyperparameters, and architecture on dynamics (explicit goal), relating optimizer design to implicit regularization and generalization (core focus via spectral dynamics), and leveraging high-dimensional analysis tools (RMT, free probability). The focus on spectral dynamics as a lens for implicit regularization fits squarely within the workshop's theme of understanding emergent structures and dynamics in large networks."

        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation, main technical approach (dynamical systems, free probability, Stieltjes transforms), validation plan (comparison with empirical data, correlation with accuracy, extension to adaptive optimizers), and expected outcomes (scaling laws, diagnostic tool) are articulated concisely and logically. There is minimal ambiguity in the core proposal, making it immediately understandable what the research aims to achieve and how."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like infinite-width limits, random matrix theory, and spectral analysis are used in deep learning theory, the proposed synthesis is innovative. Specifically, developing a dynamical systems model based on free probability to track the *joint* evolution of activation and Hessian spectra under different optimizers (SGD, Adam, etc.) as a way to quantitatively predict implicit regularization offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond static analysis towards modeling the *flow* of spectral properties during training."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Deriving the deterministic differential equations using free probability and Stieltjes transforms requires advanced mathematical expertise. Empirical validation involves non-trivial spectral analysis of large networks during training, which is computationally intensive but achievable with standard hardware. Extending the model to adaptive optimizers adds complexity. While challenging, the proposed steps rely on established theoretical tools and standard empirical practices, making it feasible for a dedicated research effort, albeit requiring considerable expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the mechanisms of implicit regularization and its connection to optimization and architecture is a fundamental open problem in deep learning. Providing a predictive, analyzable framework based on spectral dynamics could lead to major advancements in our theoretical understanding of generalization. Furthermore, the potential development of scaling laws and practical diagnostics for hyperparameter tuning would have substantial practical value, potentially reducing reliance on expensive empirical search and informing better model design."
