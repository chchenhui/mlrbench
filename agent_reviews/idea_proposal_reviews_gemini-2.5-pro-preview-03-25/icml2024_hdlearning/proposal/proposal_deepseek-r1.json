    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the HiLD workshop task, such as high-dimensional dynamics, scaling limits, the role of optimization/architecture, loss landscape geometry, and bridging theory with practice. It systematically elaborates on the research idea, proposing specific methods (RMT, high-dimensional stats) to analyze geometry and derive practical guidelines. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (Baskerville et al., Fort & Ganguli), positioning itself within the current research landscape and aiming to tackle the identified challenges like the theory-practice gap and high-dimensional complexity."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology section clearly outlines both the theoretical framework (RMT, Hessian analysis, gradient dynamics with specific equations) and the empirical validation plan (architectures, datasets, metrics, experimental phases). The language is precise and technical, leaving little room for ambiguity. The significance and expected contributions are also clearly articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it leverages existing tools like Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and concepts discussed in the cited literature (Hessian spectra, gradient dynamics), its novelty lies in the proposed synthesis and extension. Specifically, it aims to develop a *unified* framework connecting high-dimensional geometry explicitly to *scaling laws* (with model width/depth and data complexity) and *practical guidelines* for optimizer and architecture design (e.g., adaptive step sizes based on lambda_max, architecture scaling based on condition number). This focus on deriving actionable metrics and bridging the theory-practice gap through a systematic geometric analysis offers a fresh perspective compared to studying individual phenomena in isolation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations (RMT, high-dimensional statistics, stochastic processes via Fokker-Planck equations) and cites relevant, established work. The proposed methodology is robust, combining theoretical derivations with a well-designed empirical validation plan using standard techniques (Lanczos iteration, mode connectivity) across diverse models and datasets. The technical formulations presented (e.g., Marchenko-Pastur law, gradient descent equation) are appropriate and correctly stated within their assumed contexts. The plan to validate theoretical predictions empirically adds to the overall rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The empirical validation requires significant computational resources (training large models like Transformers on ImageNet, Hessian computations). The theoretical derivations using RMT and Fokker-Planck equations can be mathematically intensive and might require simplifying assumptions that could limit generality, although the empirical part aims to address this. Expertise in deep learning theory, RMT, and large-scale experimentation is necessary. While the methods are established, the scale and theoretical depth make it ambitious, requiring a well-equipped research environment. The risks associated with the complexity of theoretical derivations and computational costs are manageable but present."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses fundamental questions about learning dynamics in high-dimensional spaces, a critical area in modern deep learning. Understanding the interplay between loss geometry, optimization, and architecture has profound implications. Successfully bridging the theory-practice gap by providing data-driven guidelines for optimizer tuning and architecture scaling could lead to more efficient training, better model performance, and increased reliability. It directly tackles key challenges outlined in the task description and literature, with the potential to make substantial contributions to both the theoretical understanding and practical application of deep learning."
