    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core themes of Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning (IMOL), including autonomous lifelong learning, intrinsic motivation (using learning progress and novelty), adaptive goal creation (via the hierarchy), incremental skill learning and composition, generalization, and operating in open-ended environments (procedurally generated worlds). It explicitly tackles the limitations of current agents mentioned in the task, such as reliance on fixed goals and the need for flexibility and autonomy over long timescales."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation, the core components (hierarchical structure, dual intrinsic motivation signals, neurosymbolic memory, prioritized replay), the specific mechanisms driving each component (learning progress via prediction error, novelty via state visitation), and the proposed evaluation methodology. The distinction between high-level exploration goals and low-level exploitation goals is well-articulated. While full implementation details would require a longer paper, the conceptual framework is presented with excellent clarity and minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by proposing a specific and integrated framework. While individual components like hierarchical RL, intrinsic motivation (learning progress, novelty), neurosymbolic methods, and replay buffers exist, the novelty lies in their synthesis: specifically, the dual intrinsic motivation system mapped to different hierarchical levels (learning progress for exploration meta-controller, novelty for exploitation policy), combined with a neurosymbolic memory for dynamic skill composition and explicit mechanisms (prioritized replay based on skill diversity/utility) for lifelong learning within this architecture. It offers a fresh perspective on integrating these elements for autonomous skill acquisition."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating hierarchical RL, dual intrinsic motivation sources, a neurosymbolic memory system with dynamic modularity, and robust lifelong learning mechanisms into a single cohesive agent is complex. Training and evaluating such a system in complex, procedurally generated 3D environments over long timescales would require substantial computational resources and sophisticated engineering. Tuning the interplay between the different components (meta-controller, policy, memory, replay) will likely be difficult. While conceptually sound and based on existing research lines, the practical realization is ambitious and requires considerable effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses fundamental challenges in AI, particularly the quest for autonomous, lifelong learning agents capable of open-ended skill acquisition, as highlighted in the task description. Success would represent a major advancement over agents reliant on predefined rewards or goal spaces, potentially enabling more adaptable robots, personalized educational tools, and agents capable of operating autonomously in complex, real-world scenarios. It aligns perfectly with the goals of the IMOL research community and tackles critical limitations of current AI."
