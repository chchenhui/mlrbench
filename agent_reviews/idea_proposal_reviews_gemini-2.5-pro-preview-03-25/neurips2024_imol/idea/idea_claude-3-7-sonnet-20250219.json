        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research into Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning (IMOL), highlighting the limitations of current agents in adapting, creating goals, and achieving lifelong learning. The idea directly addresses these points by proposing a framework for agents to autonomously generate and evolve their goal spaces, moving beyond predefined objectives, which is central to the concept of open-ended learning discussed in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of fixed goal spaces), outlines the main proposal (dynamic generation and evolution of goal spaces via meta-learning), and breaks it down into three understandable components (generative model, selection mechanism, evolution module) with specified functions. The overall objective (emergent goal space for robust generalization and open-endedness) is explicitly articulated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like goal generation and intrinsic motivation exist, the proposed integration of a generative model for goals, a multi-criteria adaptive selection mechanism, and particularly an explicit goal space *evolution* module (merging, splitting, abstracting) within a meta-learning framework offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond selecting goals from a predefined space or learning static goal representations towards dynamically restructuring the goal space itself, which is a significant step towards true open-endedness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Components like generative models for goals and selection mechanisms based on novelty/progress build on existing techniques. However, the 'goal space evolution module' (merging, splitting, abstracting based on discovered relationships) is complex and less explored. Defining robust mechanisms for these operations and ensuring stability within the meta-learning loop requires considerable research and engineering effort. Integrating all three components effectively poses a substantial challenge."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental limitation in current AI, particularly in reinforcement learning and robotics: the inability of agents to autonomously define and adapt their own learning objectives for open-ended development. Successfully implementing this idea could lead to major advancements in creating truly autonomous agents capable of lifelong learning in complex, unpredictable environments, aligning perfectly with the core challenges highlighted in the task description for the IMOL field."
