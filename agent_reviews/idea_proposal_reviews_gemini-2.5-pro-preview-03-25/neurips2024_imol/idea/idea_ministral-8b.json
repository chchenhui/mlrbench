    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task focuses on Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning (IMOL), highlighting the need for AI systems that exhibit autonomy, flexibility, generalization, adaptive goal creation, and lifelong learning in realistic open-ended environments. The research idea directly addresses these points by proposing an 'Adaptive Intrinsic Motivation' framework specifically designed for 'Real-World Autonomous Learning', aiming to enhance adaptability, flexibility, and support lifelong learning in diverse domains. It explicitly targets the limitations of current IM approaches in real-world complexity and long-term adaptability, which aligns perfectly with the problem statement in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea presents a clear motivation, overall goal, and expected outcomes. The core concept of an adaptive IM system is understandable. However, the description of the key components lacks specific detail. For instance, it mentions using a neural network for novelty detection and RL for reward shaping but doesn't specify the types of networks/algorithms or the exact mechanisms for adaptation or lifelong integration. The mention of a 'multi-agent reinforcement learning approach' is also ambiguous â€“ it's unclear if this refers to multiple agents learning collaboratively, competing, or if it's a framework applied *to* multi-agent systems, or perhaps a meta-learning approach where agents learn the IM strategy. This lack of specificity in the 'how' and the ambiguity around the multi-agent aspect prevent a higher score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines several existing concepts within IMOL and RL: intrinsic motivation, novelty detection (often NN-based), dynamic rewards/reward shaping, and lifelong learning. While these individual components are not new, the proposed novelty lies in their integration into an *adaptive* framework specifically targeting *real-world* complexity and *lifelong* learning. The emphasis on dynamic adjustment of novelty estimation and reward shaping based on the agent's state and environment complexity offers a degree of innovation. However, the description doesn't detail fundamentally new mechanisms, suggesting it builds significantly on existing work (as cited in the task description). The potential novelty of the 'multi-agent RL approach' is unclear due to ambiguity. Overall, it appears to be a valuable synthesis and extension of current research rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "Implementing the individual components (NN-based novelty, RL-based reward shaping, lifelong learning mechanisms) is feasible based on current ML research, although each presents challenges. However, integrating these into a single, robustly *adaptive* system that functions effectively in complex, dynamic *real-world* environments poses significant hurdles. Challenges include data efficiency, sim-to-real transfer (if simulated), safety, computational cost (especially for lifelong learning and potentially multi-agent RL), and robust evaluation in truly open-ended scenarios. The ambition to tackle real-world complexity directly makes the overall feasibility somewhat challenging, requiring substantial engineering effort and potentially facing unforeseen obstacles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant and fundamental challenge in AI: achieving autonomous, adaptive, lifelong learning agents capable of operating in complex, open-ended real-world environments. This aligns directly with the core goals of the IMOL field as described in the task description and represents a critical step towards more capable and versatile AI. Success in this area would have a substantial impact, potentially enabling breakthroughs in robotics, autonomous systems, and other domains requiring AI to operate independently and adaptively over long periods. The potential impact is high due to the foundational nature of the problem being addressed."
