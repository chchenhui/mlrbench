    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task emphasizes the need for autonomous, lifelong learning machines capable of open-ended skill acquisition, highlighting current limitations in adaptive goal creation, switching, and incremental learning over long timescales. The proposed idea directly addresses these points by focusing on a self-organizing curriculum generated through the co-evolution of intrinsic motivation and goal generation, aiming explicitly at structured, long-term, open-ended development. It aligns perfectly with the core goals and challenges of Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning (IMOL) as described."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation is understandable, and the core concept of co-evolving the intrinsic motivation mechanism and the goal generator is explained. The key components (generative model for goals, IM feedback based on learning progress, adjustment of policy and generator) are identified. The intended outcome (dynamic, self-organizing curriculum) is explicitly stated. While specific algorithmic details are omitted (as expected for an idea summary), the overall mechanism and objective are communicated effectively with only minor ambiguities regarding the exact nature of the co-evolutionary update rule."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like intrinsic motivation based on learning progress, goal generation using generative models, and automatic curriculum learning exist independently, the proposed tight coupling and *co-evolution* of the goal generator *itself* based directly on intrinsic motivation feedback (learning progress) appears innovative. Many existing approaches use fixed goal spaces, predefined sampling strategies, or external curriculum mechanisms. This idea suggests a more integrated, self-organizing system where the goal space adapts dynamically based on the agent's learning trajectory, driven internally. This specific mechanism of shaping the goal generator's parameters via IM feedback represents a fresh perspective on achieving structured open-ended learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current machine learning techniques, but presents moderate implementation challenges. Components like generative models (e.g., VAEs, GANs) and intrinsic motivation modules (e.g., prediction error, learning progress) are well-established. However, implementing the co-evolutionary loop requires careful design. Specifically, determining how the (potentially sparse or noisy) intrinsic reward signal effectively updates the parameters of the goal generator could be complex and may require sophisticated techniques (e.g., policy gradients applied to generator parameters, evolutionary methods). Ensuring the stability of this feedback loop (avoiding collapse or stagnation) and managing the computational cost of simultaneously training the agent policy and the goal generator are significant engineering hurdles. Nevertheless, it seems achievable with careful experimentation and refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and impact potential. It directly tackles a fundamental challenge in AI and robotics: enabling agents to learn autonomously and continuously in complex, open-ended environments without predefined tasks or curricula. Successfully implementing such a system could lead to major advancements in lifelong learning, autonomous robotics, and artificial general intelligence. By allowing agents to structure their own learning effectively over long timescales, it addresses a key limitation of current IM and RL methods, potentially unlocking more human-like learning capabilities and contributing significantly to the IMOL field as described in the task."
