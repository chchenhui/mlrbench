        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of System-2 reasoning in transformers, tackling specific challenges mentioned like distinguishing memorization from rule-based learning, syntactic generalization, and compositionality. It proposes a mechanism (hybrid symbolic-augmented learning), discusses implementation strategy (explicit integration), and explicitly mentions the need for benchmarking and avoiding data contamination, all of which are key questions posed by the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main components (symbolic augmentation, training, implementation, benchmarking), and expected outcomes are laid out logically. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific nature of the symbolic reasoning modules, the precise details of the hybrid SL/RL training methodology, and the mechanism for dynamic switching between modes. While the overall concept is understandable, these finer points introduce minor ambiguities."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Hybrid neural-symbolic approaches are an established area of research (Neuro-Symbolic AI). The novelty lies more in the specific application to enhance System-2 reasoning within modern transformer architectures, the proposed combination of SL and RL for training the hybrid interaction, and the focus on dynamic switching. It's a relevant and timely combination of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating symbolic modules effectively within complex transformer architectures is non-trivial. Designing the appropriate symbolic representations and reasoning mechanisms, developing a robust training regime combining SL and RL for this hybrid system, and implementing a reliable dynamic switching mechanism require considerable research and engineering effort. Furthermore, creating robust benchmarks for System-2 reasoning that avoid data contamination is an acknowledged hard problem in the field. While plausible, successful implementation is not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Achieving robust System-2 reasoning is a major goal in AI, crucial for moving beyond pattern matching towards deeper understanding and complex problem-solving. Addressing the limitations of current models regarding generalization, compositionality, and distinguishing memorization from reasoning would represent a meaningful contribution. Success could lead to more capable, reliable, safe, and interpretable AI systems, impacting various applications."
