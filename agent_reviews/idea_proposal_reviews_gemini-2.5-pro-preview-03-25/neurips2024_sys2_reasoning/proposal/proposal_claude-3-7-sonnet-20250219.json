    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core questions of the workshop task (need for System-2, mechanisms, implementation location, benchmarking, data contamination). It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the Reflection Layers, self-supervised framework, and evaluation strategy. Furthermore, it effectively integrates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as leveraging self-supervision, curriculum learning, contrastive methods, meta-learning concepts for reasoning, and the importance of procedural benchmarks, while positioning itself relative to existing work like S2A and Dualformer. The proposal consistently focuses on developing inherent System-2 reasoning within the model, as outlined in the idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, motivation, and overall approach are presented logically. The methodology section details the architecture (ReasonNet, Reflection Layers) and training framework (curriculum, contrastive, meta-reasoning) with mathematical formulations and loss functions. The evaluation plan is specific. However, some minor ambiguities exist: the precise architectural details of the Reflection Layers and Refinement Mechanism could be more concrete, and the methods for generating ground-truth quality labels (Q) for the Reflection Loss and defining the Contradiction function for the Consistency Loss require further elaboration. Despite these minor points, the proposal is largely understandable and well-structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it builds upon existing concepts like self-supervision, contrastive learning, curriculum learning, and meta-learning (referenced in the literature review), its core novelty lies in the specific architectural integration of 'Reflection Layers' and an iterative 'Refinement Mechanism' *within* the transformer architecture itself. This aims to foster inherent, step-wise self-correction and reasoning, distinguishing it from external frameworks (like CoT prompting or search) or models with separate explicit modes (like Dualformer). The combination of this architecture with a tailored multi-faceted self-supervised training regime specifically targeting emergent System-2 reasoning represents a fresh approach. The proposal clearly articulates how it differs from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established cognitive science concepts (System-1/System-2) and leverages well-understood machine learning techniques (transformers, various self-supervised methods). The proposed architecture, while complex, is conceptually plausible. The mathematical formulations for the architecture and loss functions are provided and appear reasonable, although some components (like the specific layer types for reflection/refinement, the Contradiction function) need more detailed specification for implementation. The multi-component loss function is comprehensive but might pose tuning challenges. The evaluation plan, emphasizing procedural benchmarks and data contamination prevention, is rigorous and appropriate for assessing genuine reasoning. The approach is well-motivated by the literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing the novel Reflection Layers and Refinement Mechanism, integrating them effectively, and ensuring stable training requires considerable engineering effort. The multi-faceted self-supervised training framework involves complex data generation (sound/flawed paths, quality labels) and intricate loss balancing. Training models up to 7B parameters with this complexity demands substantial computational resources (GPU time, storage). Developing novel procedural benchmarks is also a non-trivial task. The 12-month timeline appears ambitious given the technical complexity and potential research challenges (e.g., training convergence, effectiveness of reflection layers). While technically possible with sufficient resources, the plan involves considerable effort and risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized limitation of current AI models â€“ the lack of robust System-2 reasoning. Successfully developing inherent reasoning capabilities within transformers would represent a major advancement, potentially leading to more reliable, predictable, and trustworthy AI systems (enhancing AI safety). It could unlock new applications requiring complex logical deduction and problem-solving. The research also promises valuable insights into the mechanisms of reasoning in neural networks and contributes rigorous evaluation methodologies (procedural benchmarks) to the field. It directly tackles fundamental questions about the future of AI development beyond scaling."
