    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key questions regarding how to imbue LLMs with System-2 reasoning, whether it should be emergent or engineered (proposing engineered components to foster emergence), implicit vs. explicit implementation (proposing implicit within the model), and benchmarking/data contamination (proposing the Sys2Math benchmark). It faithfully elaborates on the research idea's core concepts (Reflection Layers, self-supervised training mix). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and positions itself relative to the cited literature, referencing concepts like System-2 Attention, Dualformer, self-supervision, curriculum/contrastive/RL learning for reasoning, meta-learning, and procedural benchmarks, while also addressing the key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology (including Reflection Layers architecture, training stages, benchmark design), and expected outcomes are articulated clearly with a logical structure. The use of formulas and specific techniques (contrastive loss, RL reward) adds precision. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact nature of the residual network 'E' in the Reasoning Adjustment step or the detailed workings of the 'Meta-Controller', but these do not significantly impede the overall understanding of the proposed research at this stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like curriculum learning, contrastive learning, RL, and meta-learning concepts exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the specific architectural proposal of 'Reflection Layers' designed for internal self-critique and correction based on a learned logical coherence score is novel. The combination of this architecture with the specific blend of self-supervised, contrastive, and reinforcement learning strategies tailored for emergent System-2 reasoning represents a fresh perspective distinct from prior work like S2A or Dualformer, which focus on context regeneration or randomized traces. The development of the Sys2Math benchmark with anti-contamination measures also contributes to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the System-1/System-2 dichotomy and leverages established ML techniques (Transformers, self-supervision, RL, etc.). The proposed 'Reflection Layers' architecture is conceptually plausible, drawing inspiration from meta-cognition, although the effectiveness of the specific coherence score formulation needs empirical validation. The training methodology combining curriculum, contrastive, and RL is a reasonable, albeit complex, approach. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and comprehensive metrics. The benchmark design incorporates sound principles like procedural generation and anti-contamination. Minor concerns exist about the potential oversimplification of the coherence score and the complexity of optimizing the multi-component system, but the overall technical approach is well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Implementing and effectively training the Reflection Layers alongside the base transformer using a complex multi-objective function (consistency loss, adjustment loss, meta-controller objective, contrastive loss, RL policy) will require significant engineering effort and computational resources. Ensuring training stability and convergence could be difficult. Curating or generating the required diverse and complex reasoning data for the curriculum poses another challenge. The 10-month timeline appears ambitious given the technical complexity and potential for research hurdles. While conceptually sound, successful execution requires substantial resources and expertise, carrying moderate risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized limitation of current AI systems â€“ the lack of robust, verifiable System-2 reasoning. Success in developing intrinsic reasoning capabilities, as proposed, would represent a major advancement, enhancing AI safety, reliability, and applicability in complex domains like science and law. The research directly contributes to the fundamental debate on emergent versus engineered capabilities in AI. Furthermore, the proposed Sys2Math benchmark addresses a known weakness in current evaluation methodologies (data contamination) and could become a valuable resource for the research community."
