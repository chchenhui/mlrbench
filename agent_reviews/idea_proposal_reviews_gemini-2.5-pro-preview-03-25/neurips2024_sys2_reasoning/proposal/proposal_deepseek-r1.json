    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key questions regarding System-2 reasoning mechanisms (proposing internal architectural/training changes), emergence vs. explicit systems (arguing for emergence), and benchmarking (using procedural generation to avoid contamination). It faithfully elaborates on the research idea's core concepts (Reflection Layers, specific training methods). Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, citing relevant papers (S2A, Dualformer, meta-learning, contrastive learning, procedural benchmarks) and explicitly addressing the key challenges identified (efficiency, consistency, generalization, contamination, symbolic integration)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology (architecture, training, evaluation), and significance are presented logically and are easy to understand. The structure is coherent. Minor ambiguities exist, primarily concerning the precise mechanism by which the Reflection Layers' confidence scores influence subsequent processing (e.g., 'amplify or suppress attention heads' is conceptually clear but lacks mathematical formalization). However, this does not significantly impede the overall comprehension of the proposed approach."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. The core novelty lies in the proposed 'Reflection Layers' – an internal meta-learning component designed to facilitate iterative self-evaluation of reasoning steps within the transformer architecture itself, aiming for emergent System-2 capabilities. While it builds upon existing concepts like meta-learning, self-supervision, contrastive learning, and curriculum learning (cited in the literature review), the specific architectural integration (interleaved meta-networks evaluating intermediate states) and the combined training strategy (contrastive paths, consistency rewards) offer a fresh perspective distinct from prior work like S2A (context regeneration) or Dualformer (randomized traces) and explicit symbolic integration."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the System-1/System-2 dichotomy and leverages established techniques (meta-learning, contrastive learning, curriculum learning, RL for rewards). The methodology is generally well-defined: the Reflection Layer concept is plausible, the training components are based on prior work, and the evaluation plan using procedural benchmarks and relevant metrics is robust. Minor weaknesses include the lack of a precise mathematical formulation for how Reflection Layers modulate attention and potential challenges in robustly defining and measuring reward components like 'Coherence'. The reliance on a symbolic solver for generating valid reasoning paths is a sound choice for grounding but introduces a dependency."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing deep learning technology and methods. Implementing the Reflection Layers architecturally seems manageable. The main challenges lie in the practical implementation of the training framework: generating diverse and meaningful valid/invalid reasoning paths (requiring a potentially complex symbolic solver and perturbation strategies), potentially stabilizing the RL component (policy gradient for rewards), and the significant computational resources typical of LLM research. The procedural benchmark generation also requires considerable engineering effort. While challenging, these aspects are within the realm of current ML research capabilities, making the proposal generally realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses a critical limitation of current AI models – the lack of robust, verifiable System-2 reasoning. Improving this capability has major implications for AI safety, trustworthiness, and applicability in complex domains. The research directly tackles core questions about how reasoning emerges or can be engineered in neural networks. If successful, it could lead to substantial advancements in model capabilities, offer insights into the nature of reasoning in AI, and provide a pathway towards more reliable systems, demonstrating improvements beyond simple scaling. The focus on rigorous, contamination-free evaluation further enhances its potential contribution."
