    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core questions posed by the workshop task, such as how to imbue LLMs with System-2 capabilities, whether it should be emergent/internal vs. explicit/external, and how to benchmark it while avoiding data contamination. The methodology directly implements the research idea (Reflection Layers, curriculum, contrastive learning for emergent internal reasoning). It incorporates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review (self-supervision, meta-learning, curriculum/contrastive learning, procedural benchmarks, logical consistency)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear in its overall goals and structure. The motivation, high-level approach (Reflection Layers, curriculum, contrastive), and expected impact are well-articulated. However, the technical details of the core novel component, the 'Reflection Layers', are significantly underdeveloped. The mathematical formulation provided is superficial and doesn't explain how logical consistency is checked (`IsLogicallyConsistent`) or how corrections are applied (`Corrected`). It's unclear how these layers are implemented, trained, or integrated within the transformer architecture. Similarly, details on the procedural benchmarks, data generation for curriculum and contrastive learning, and baseline models are lacking, leaving ambiguity in the experimental design. While the concepts are introduced, the lack of technical depth hinders full clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like curriculum learning, contrastive learning, and self-supervision are established techniques (as shown in the literature review), their specific combination within a unified framework targeting emergent System-2 reasoning is innovative. The core novelty lies in the proposed 'Reflection Layers' â€“ an internal meta-learning mechanism for self-evaluation and iterative refinement of reasoning steps within the transformer. This contrasts with external scaffolding approaches (e.g., search, tool use) or purely attention-based modifications (like S2A). The focus on developing *inherent* reasoning capabilities through this specific architectural modification and training regime offers a fresh perspective distinct from much prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on generally sound concepts like the System-1/System-2 distinction and leverages established ML techniques (self-supervision, curriculum learning, contrastive learning). However, the soundness of the core proposed mechanism, the 'Reflection Layers', is questionable due to the lack of technical specification. The proposal doesn't detail how logical consistency checking and correction would work reliably and generally within a neural network, nor how these layers would be trained or integrated without potentially hindering the base model. The mathematical descriptions are too simplistic to assess rigor. The experimental design also lacks sufficient detail (datasets, specific benchmark design, baseline choices) to fully evaluate its methodological rigor. The reliance on an ill-defined core component weakens the overall soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is uncertain, primarily due to the underspecified 'Reflection Layers'. Designing, implementing, and training such layers effectively poses significant technical challenges. Defining and learning the `IsLogicallyConsistent` and `Corrected` functions in a generalizable way is non-trivial. Integrating these layers might introduce substantial computational overhead and training instability. Furthermore, generating appropriate datasets for the curriculum (increasing complexity) and contrastive learning (sound vs. flawed paths), especially for complex reasoning, can be resource-intensive. Developing novel procedural benchmarks that effectively isolate reasoning and prevent contamination is also a known challenge. Without more technical detail and a clearer plan for implementation and data generation, the feasibility is questionable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem in AI: the lack of robust System-2 reasoning capabilities in current large language models. Improving reasoning is crucial for AI safety, trustworthiness, and enabling applications requiring complex problem-solving, logic, and mathematics. The proposed approach, aiming to develop *inherent* reasoning capabilities within the model architecture rather than relying solely on external methods, could lead to major advancements if successful. The focus on systematic generalization and rigorous evaluation using novel benchmarks further enhances its potential impact. Success would represent a substantial contribution to the field."
