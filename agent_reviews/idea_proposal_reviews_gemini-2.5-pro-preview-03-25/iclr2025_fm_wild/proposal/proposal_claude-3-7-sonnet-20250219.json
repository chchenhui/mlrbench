    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key themes: enhancing FM reasoning and planning for complex 'in the wild' tasks, improving reliability (via the meta-cognitive layer), integrating multiple modalities, and tackling practical limitations by proposing a specific architecture. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the hierarchical memory and controller. Furthermore, it positions itself clearly within the provided literature, referencing concepts like multi-modal CoT, memory augmentation, hierarchical structures, and meta-cognition, while also addressing the key challenges identified in the review (integration, memory management, traceability, error correction, evaluation)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected impact. Key components like the hierarchical memory layers (FKS, RTM, MCL) and the memory controller functions are explained clearly, often supplemented with mathematical notation (though some function definitions are conceptual). The objectives are explicit, and the experimental design is well-articulated. There is minimal ambiguity, making the proposal easy to understand."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components draw inspiration from existing work identified in the literature review (e.g., hierarchical memory, reasoning traces/CoT, meta-cognitive evaluation, retrieval augmentation), the specific combination and integration into the MMRAM architecture are novel. The synergy between the factual store, dynamic reasoning trace, and the meta-cognitive layer for error correction, all managed by a dedicated controller within a multi-modal context, represents a fresh approach distinct from standard RAG or simpler memory networks. The focus on dynamic path planning and backtracking guided by reasoning quality evaluation adds to its innovative character."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (external memory, attention, graph representations, meta-cognition) and established methods (Transformers, RAG concepts). The proposed architecture is logically coherent, and the functions of each component are well-justified. The mathematical notation provides a good level of detail, although specific definitions for some functions (e.g., f_eval, f_plan) would strengthen it further. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant domains, metrics, baselines, and ablation studies, indicating methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Building and integrating the three-tiered memory system, the sophisticated memory controller, and the meta-cognitive layer with a base FM is technically complex and requires significant engineering effort. Curating or acquiring the specified multi-modal datasets with ground-truth reasoning steps for three different domains is a substantial undertaking. The computational resources needed for training and evaluation will be high. While conceptually sound, the ambition and complexity raise concerns about practical implementation within typical project constraints and resources, introducing moderate risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized limitation of current FMs â€“ their struggle with complex, multi-step, multi-modal reasoning, especially 'in the wild'. Successfully enhancing these capabilities would have major implications for AI theory (understanding augmented reasoning) and practice. The potential applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare, scientific discovery, and education are transformative. The research directly aligns with the core goals of the workshop and, if successful, could lead to substantially more reliable and capable AI systems."
