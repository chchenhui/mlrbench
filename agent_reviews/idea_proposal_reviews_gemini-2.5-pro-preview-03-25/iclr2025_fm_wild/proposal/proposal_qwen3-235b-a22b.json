    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key themes ('FMs in the wild'), including enhancing reasoning for complex tasks (multi-hop QA, math), improving reliability (reducing hallucinations via traceable reasoning), integrating multiple modalities, and benchmarking in real-world settings (medical, science). The methodology meticulously follows the research idea's concept of a hierarchical multi-modal memory (factual, trace, meta-cognitive layers) managed by a controller. It also effectively incorporates and builds upon the provided literature, citing relevant works (e.g., CMMCoT as a baseline) and addressing the key challenges identified in the review, such as multi-modal integration, traceability, and error detection."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, the three-tier memory architecture is explained conceptually with some technical details (formulas, database types), and the experimental plan (datasets, baselines, metrics, ablations) is well-defined. The structure is logical (Intro, Methods, Outcomes). Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for the transformer controller's interaction with the frozen FM, the specifics of the backtracking process, and the training strategy for the controller and meta-cognitive layer. However, these do not significantly obscure the overall research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like memory augmentation, multi-modal reasoning, hierarchical structures, controllers, and meta-cognition exist in the literature (as evidenced by the review, e.g., Johnson & Brown, White & Black, Green & Blue), the specific proposed architecture combining these elements into a three-tier system (Factual Knowledge, Reasoning Trace, Meta-Cognitive Validation) explicitly designed for dynamic, validated multi-modal reasoning appears novel. The integration of a dedicated reasoning trace layer with a meta-cognitive validation/backtracking mechanism for multi-modal tasks distinguishes it from existing approaches like CMMCoT, offering a potentially more structured and robust solution."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established concepts (memory networks, transformers, KGs, vector DBs) and proposes a logical architecture. The experimental design is strong, featuring relevant datasets, SOTA baselines (CMMCoT), comprehensive metrics, and ablation studies. However, some technical details lack depth, slightly weakening the rigor. Specifically, the proposal could elaborate more on the training procedures for the controller (T_\\\\phi) and the meta-cognitive classifier (C_\\\\theta), the exact nature of the interaction between the controller and the base FM, and the implementation details of the backtracking mechanism. The provided technical formulations are standard but brief."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing technologies (FMs, ViTs, KGs, vector DBs) and standard datasets (or derivatives like MedQA-MM). The research plan is well-defined. Implementation requires significant expertise (multi-modal ML, FMs, KGs) and computational resources (GPU clusters for training/inference), which are standard assumptions in FM research. Potential challenges include the complexity of integrating diverse components, effectively training the controller and meta-cognitive layer, and managing the computational cost of the memory lookups and validation steps during inference, but these appear manageable within a well-resourced research environment."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying FMs 'in the wild': their limited ability to perform complex, reliable, multi-modal reasoning. Improving this capability, particularly with enhanced traceability and error checking (via the proposed memory layers), would be a major advancement. Success would directly benefit high-stakes applications like clinical decision support, STEM education, and scientific discovery, as clearly articulated. The research directly aligns with the core goals of the workshop task description, aiming to make FMs more useful, reliable, and trustworthy in real-world scenarios."
