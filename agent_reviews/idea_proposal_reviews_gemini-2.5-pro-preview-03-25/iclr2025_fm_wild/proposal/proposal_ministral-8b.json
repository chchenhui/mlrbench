    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on enhancing FM reasoning for complex 'in-the-wild' tasks (multi-hop QA, mathematical problem-solving) and integrating multiple modalities, which are key problems highlighted in the task description. The proposal meticulously elaborates on the research idea, detailing the hierarchical memory structure and controller. Furthermore, it explicitly connects to the provided literature review by referencing concepts like memory augmentation, multi-modal reasoning, meta-cognition, and transformer controllers, while also aiming to tackle the key challenges identified (multi-modal integration, memory management, traceability, error detection, evaluation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear and well-structured, with understandable objectives and a logical methodology outline. The core concept of the hierarchical memory (factual, trace, meta-cognitive) is well-explained. However, some technical details lack specificity. For instance, the precise interaction mechanisms between the FM, the transformer controller, and the different memory layers could be elaborated further. The function and implementation of the 'meta-cognitive layer' are described conceptually but lack concrete details. The mathematical formulation provided is very high-level and doesn't fully capture the system's complexity. While the main ideas are comprehensible, deeper technical clarity would strengthen the proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by integrating several recent research threads (hierarchical memory, multi-modal reasoning, reasoning trace, meta-cognitive evaluation, transformer controllers) into a specific, coherent architecture. While individual components are inspired by or resemble concepts in the cited literature (e.g., hierarchical memory, meta-cognitive layers), the proposed three-layer structure (factual, trace, meta-cognitive) tailored for dynamic, traceable, and self-correcting multi-modal reasoning in FMs appears distinct. The emphasis on integrating a reasoning trace memory and a meta-cognitive layer for error detection within this hierarchy offers a novel approach compared to standard RAG or simpler memory augmentation techniques. It's an innovative combination rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound theoretical foundations, leveraging established concepts like FMs, memory augmentation, multi-modal processing, and transformers. The motivation is well-justified by the limitations of existing models. The proposed methodology follows a logical research design. However, the technical rigor could be improved. The description of the model architecture and controller interactions remains somewhat high-level. The mathematical formulation is overly simplistic and lacks detail. While the overall approach is plausible and grounded in recent research, the lack of detailed technical specifications for critical components (like the meta-cognitive layer's error detection mechanism or the controller's precise operation) slightly weakens its perceived rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building and training a complex system involving a large FM integrated with a three-layer dynamic memory system and a sophisticated controller requires substantial engineering effort and computational resources. Gathering or creating suitable large-scale, diverse multi-modal datasets for the specified domains and complex reasoning tasks is non-trivial. The successful training and integration of the meta-cognitive layer for reliable error detection and correction represent a considerable research risk. While conceptually plausible, the practical implementation complexity and resource requirements make the feasibility satisfactory rather than high."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of FMs, particularly in multi-modal settings, for real-world ('in-the-wild') applications. Improving reasoning, reliability, and adaptability in domains like healthcare, scientific discovery, and education is critical for the responsible and effective deployment of AI. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in how FMs support expert decision-making and tackle complex problems, potentially having a transformative impact. The focus aligns perfectly with the critical challenges facing FM deployment today."
