        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop on FMs in the Wild), the research idea (Multi-Modal Memory Augmentation), and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key problems (Reasoning, Reliability, Adaptation, Practical Limitations) and scope (multi-modal integration, reasoning advancements, reliability). The proposed HMA-FM architecture directly implements the research idea's hierarchical memory (FKS, RTM, MCS) and controller. It explicitly references concepts from the literature review (CMMCoT, memory networks, controllers, meta-cognition) and aims to tackle the identified challenges (multi-modal integration, traceability, error detection). The objectives and significance are tightly linked to the workshop's goals of making FMs useful and trustworthy 'in the wild'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes) is logical and easy to follow. The problem statement is precise, and the research objectives are specific and clearly articulated. The methodology section provides a detailed description of the proposed HMA-FM architecture, including its components (FKS, RTM, MCS, Controller) and their interactions, aided by a conceptual diagram. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and unambiguous. The language is precise, and technical concepts are explained well."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building upon existing concepts like memory augmentation (Johnson & Brown, 2024; Yin et al., 2023), CoT (Wei et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2025), controllers (White & Black, 2024), and meta-cognition (Green & Blue, 2024), the novelty lies in the specific *hierarchical integration* of three distinct memory layers (Factual, Trace, Meta-Cognitive) managed by a dedicated controller, specifically designed for complex, multi-step, *multi-modal* reasoning with an explicit *error detection and backtracking* mechanism. This combination represents a significant advancement over standard RAG or simpler memory architectures discussed in the literature review, offering a more structured and verifiable reasoning process."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established FM principles and relevant prior work on memory augmentation and reasoning enhancement. The proposed methodology, involving distinct memory components and a controller, is logically structured. The plan to use transformer-based models for the controller and potentially the MCS layer is appropriate. The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines, ablation studies, and a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics covering task performance, reasoning quality, and efficiency. The technical descriptions are conceptually sound, although detailed implementation specifics are naturally high-level at the proposal stage."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building and integrating the entire HMA-FM system (base FM, FKS, RTM, MCS, Controller) is complex. Training the controller effectively, especially the decision logic for querying, generation, MCS invocation, and backtracking, could be difficult (potentially requiring complex RL or large amounts of trace data). Ensuring the MCS layer reliably detects errors and triggers appropriate backtracking is non-trivial. Access to suitable multi-modal benchmark datasets requiring complex reasoning and potentially curating new data adds to the challenge. Significant computational resources and engineering effort would be required, making it ambitious but achievable for a well-resourced team."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current FMs: their struggle with complex, multi-step, multi-modal reasoning and their susceptibility to hallucination, which hinders deployment 'in the wild' for high-stakes tasks (as highlighted by the workshop description). Successfully developing HMA-FM could lead to major advancements in FM reliability, trustworthiness, and capability in domains like healthcare, scientific discovery, and education. The focus on reasoning traceability (RTM) and error correction (MCS) directly tackles key concerns about responsible AI deployment. The potential contributions are substantial and align perfectly with the workshop's central themes."
