    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'FMs in the wild', tackling key problems like reasoning/planning (multi-step, multi-modal), reliability (error detection, traceability), practical limitations (memory augmentation), and multi-modal integration. The proposed HMMMA framework directly implements the research idea's hierarchical memory concept (factual, trace, meta-cognitive) with a controller. Furthermore, it explicitly builds upon and synthesizes concepts from the provided literature (hierarchical memory, controllers, meta-cognition, multi-modal reasoning) and aims to address the identified key challenges (multi-modal integration, memory management, traceability, error detection, evaluation)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context and objectives unambiguously. The HMMMA architecture is broken down into logical components (Memory Modules, Controller, Updater) with clear roles. The methodology section provides formal definitions, step-by-step descriptions of the controller's operations (retrieval, generation, evaluation), and mathematical formulations (though simplified, they convey the core ideas). The evaluation plan, including benchmarks, baselines, and metrics, is specific and easy to understand. The structure is logical, and the language is precise."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like memory augmentation, hierarchical structures, transformer controllers, and meta-cognitive evaluation exist in the literature (as evidenced by the review), the novelty lies in their specific synthesis into the HMMMA framework. The integration of three distinct memory layers (factual, trace, meta-cognitive) orchestrated by a controller that performs dynamic retrieval, generation, *and* meta-cognitively triggered backtracking for multi-modal reasoning appears to be a fresh combination and extension of existing ideas. It clearly distinguishes itself from simpler RAG or single-level memory approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established ML concepts (transformers, attention, memory networks). The proposed architecture is logical, and the core mechanisms (retrieval, generation, evaluation loop) are plausible. The mathematical formulations provided are standard but potentially simplified (e.g., the meta-cognitive error score). Minor gaps exist regarding the specifics of training the controller, learning embeddings, the precise interaction mechanisms between memory layers, and the robustness of the threshold-based decision rules. However, the overall approach is well-grounded in the literature and technically coherent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires significant engineering effort to integrate the FM, controller, and three memory modules effectively. Data curation or adaptation for the three proposed multi-modal benchmarks (MedVQA-MH, DiagGeo, SciRC-MM) could be time-consuming and resource-intensive. While the core technologies exist, tuning the system (especially the meta-cognitive layer and backtracking thresholds) might be complex. The 12-month timeline is ambitious for developing, evaluating across three benchmarks, and releasing the framework, suggesting potential execution risks, but it is achievable in a well-resourced environment."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations of current FMs regarding complex reasoning, reliability, and interpretability in multi-modal, real-world scenarios ('in the wild'). Improving these aspects is crucial for deploying FMs in high-stakes domains like healthcare, science, and education, as highlighted in the proposal and the workshop's call. Success would represent a substantial advancement in FM capabilities, potentially leading to more trustworthy and capable AI systems and stimulating further research in memory-augmented architectures."
