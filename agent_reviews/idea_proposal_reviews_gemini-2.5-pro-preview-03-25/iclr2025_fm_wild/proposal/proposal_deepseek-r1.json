    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key problems outlined in the task description, such as enhancing reasoning/planning for complex multi-step, multi-modal tasks (medical QA, math, science), improving reliability by tackling hallucinations (via meta-cognitive layer), addressing practical limitations (memory scalability), and integrating multiple modalities. The methodology is a direct operationalization of the research idea (hierarchical memory, controller). Furthermore, it is well-grounded in the provided literature, citing relevant recent works (e.g., on memory augmentation, multi-modal reasoning, controllers, meta-cognition) and aiming to tackle the identified key challenges like multi-modal integration, memory management, traceability, and error detection."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, the background provides good motivation, and the methodology section details the proposed architecture (hierarchical memory layers, controller), data sources, algorithmic components (with some mathematical formulations), and experimental design (baselines, tasks, metrics). The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for training the meta-cognitive layer and the specifics of the controller's architecture beyond standard components, but these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity required for a proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like hierarchical memory, transformer-based controllers, and meta-cognitive evaluation exist in the literature (and are cited), the novelty lies in their specific synthesis and integration within a single framework. The proposed three-layer memory structure (factual, reasoning trace, meta-cognitive) combined with a controller that manages retrieval, tracking, *and* meta-cognitive error detection/backtracking for robust multi-modal reasoning appears to be a distinct contribution compared to the cited works (e.g., CMMCoT, ProReason). The integration of these specific elements to enhance reasoning robustness is a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid theoretical foundations (FMs, memory networks, attention, meta-cognition) and established methods (vector DBs, GRUs, contrastive learning). The proposed architecture is logical, and the experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, challenging tasks, and appropriate metrics. The mathematical formulations presented are standard. However, a minor gap exists in the description of how the meta-cognitive layer and the controller will be trained (e.g., supervision signal for scoring, RL strategy), which slightly impacts the overall rigor of the proposed methodology."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial resources (large FMs, compute power, curated multi-modal datasets). Integrating the complex system (FM, controller, three memory layers) effectively and training the novel components (controller, meta-cognitive layer) will likely require considerable research and engineering effort. Achieving the ambitious performance target (<500ms latency on consumer GPUs) for such a complex reasoning process is uncertain and may require extensive optimization. While technically plausible, the complexity and resource requirements introduce notable risks and challenges to successful execution."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and widely recognized limitations of current foundation models concerning complex reasoning, reliability (hallucinations), and multi-modal integration, particularly for 'in-the-wild' deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and scientific discovery, as emphasized in the task description. Success would represent a major advancement in AI capabilities, potentially enabling more trustworthy and capable AI systems. The development of benchmarks for multi-modal reasoning also adds significant value to the community."
