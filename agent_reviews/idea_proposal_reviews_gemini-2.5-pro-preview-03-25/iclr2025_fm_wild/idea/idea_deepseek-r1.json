        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's theme of 'Foundation Models in the Wild'. It directly addresses two key problems highlighted in the task description: 'In-the-wild Adaptation' (explicitly mentioning RAG, ICL, FT for domains like clinical health and education) and 'Practical Limitations in Deployment' (focusing on computational efficiency, resource constraints, and inference time). The proposed dynamic routing mechanism is a clear strategy for customizing models and overcoming practical limitations, fitting squarely within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. It clearly states the motivation (balancing adaptation and efficiency), the core mechanism (meta-learned router using RL), the inputs to the router (complexity, domain, resources), the dynamic action (selecting RAG/ICL/FT), the validation plan (multi-domain benchmarks, metrics), and the expected outcomes (reduced latency, improved OOD robustness). Minor ambiguities might exist in the exact implementation details of the router's evaluation process or the RL reward formulation, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While meta-learning, RL, and adaptation techniques (RAG, ICL, FT) are existing concepts, the proposed synthesis into a dynamic routing framework that *chooses between* these adaptation strategies based on input characteristics and resource constraints is innovative. Current approaches often focus on optimizing a single adaptation method or applying them statically. This dynamic, context-aware selection mechanism for FM adaptation represents a fresh perspective on efficient deployment."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Implementing and training a meta-learning framework with an RL agent requires considerable expertise and computational resources. Defining an effective state representation (input complexity, domain, constraints) and reward function (balancing accuracy, latency, cost) for the RL router will be crucial and non-trivial. Integrating potentially complex adaptation methods like fine-tuning into a low-latency dynamic switching mechanism adds engineering complexity. However, the underlying technologies exist, making it achievable within a dedicated research effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it addresses a critical bottleneck in the real-world deployment of foundation models: the trade-off between adaptation quality and computational cost/latency. Successfully implementing such a system could lead to major advancements in deploying powerful FMs in resource-constrained or time-sensitive environments like healthcare, education, or edge computing. The potential for substantial reductions in inference time and improved robustness directly tackles practical limitations, increasing the societal utility and accessibility of FMs, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
