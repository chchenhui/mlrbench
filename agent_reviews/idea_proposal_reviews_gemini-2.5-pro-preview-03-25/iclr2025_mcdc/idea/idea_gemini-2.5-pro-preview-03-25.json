    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the workshop's scope and topics. It directly addresses 'Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architectures', 'Applications of modularity' specifically in 'lifelong/continual learning', and touches upon concepts related to 'Model Merging' (applied to experts) and 'Adaptive Architectures' (dynamic expert pool management). The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's critique of monolithic models and the need for more sustainable, modular approaches like those enabling continual learning without unbounded growth."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is clearly articulated. The motivation (unbounded growth in modular CL), the core components (dynamic expert addition, similarity assessment, merging, pruning), and the overall goal (mitigate forgetting, control model size) are well-defined. While specific algorithmic details (e.g., exact similarity metrics, merging functions, pruning thresholds) are not fully elaborated, the conceptual framework is presented clearly and is easy to understand."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using MoE for CL and adding experts isn't new, and pruning/merging are known concepts, the proposed *adaptive framework* that combines periodic similarity assessment, knowledge consolidation via merging functionally similar experts, and pruning within a continual learning setting specifically to control model complexity is a novel contribution. It moves beyond simple expansion or basic pruning by introducing a more sophisticated dynamic management strategy tailored for lifelong learning with MoE."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core components rely on existing concepts: MoE architectures, continual learning protocols, methods for assessing model/representation similarity (e.g., using buffered data, prediction correlation), parameter averaging for merging, and usage/performance metrics for pruning. However, integrating these components effectively, defining robust similarity measures, tuning the thresholds for merging/pruning, and managing the computational overhead of the periodic assessment and consolidation steps present moderate implementation challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant as it addresses a critical bottleneck in modular approaches to continual learning: the potential for unbounded model growth and associated costs. Developing methods to manage model complexity dynamically while preserving learned knowledge is crucial for creating scalable and practical lifelong learning systems. Success in this area would represent a meaningful advancement towards more efficient and sustainable AI, aligning with the workshop's emphasis on moving beyond disposable monolithic models."
