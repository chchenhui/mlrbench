    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop call). It directly addresses the core themes of modularity (Mixture-of-Experts), collaborative development (Peer-to-Peer), decentralized training (gossip aggregation, no central server), and continual learning (mitigating forgetting, continuous specialization). It explicitly touches upon several listed topics, including MoE architectures, routing specialized experts, potential for upcycling, applications in continual learning, and decentralized/collaborative training with communication efficiency."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the main components (P2P structure, local experts, gossiped router, dynamic selection, merging) are described. The overall concept is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact mechanisms for 'expert signatures', 'representation similarity' for merging, and the specifics of the gossip protocol for the router, but these are details expected to be elaborated in a full paper. The core proposal is well-defined."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining existing concepts (MoE, P2P networking, gossip protocols, model merging) in a novel configuration specifically for continual decentralized learning. While individual components are not entirely new, their synthesis into a P2P-MoE system with dynamic cross-peer routing via a gossiped router and integrated expert merging presents a fresh perspective compared to standard centralized MoE or typical federated learning approaches. The focus on decentralized collaboration without a central orchestrator for MoE is innovative."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training local experts and using gossip protocols are standard. However, designing an efficient and robust lightweight router via gossip, enabling dynamic discovery and low-latency selection/combination of experts across potentially unreliable peers, and performing scalable expert merging based on similarity in a fully decentralized manner are non-trivial engineering and algorithmic hurdles. Communication overhead for inference routing and potential network bottlenecks need careful consideration. Considerable effort and system design would be required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses critical problems in modern ML: the cost and rigidity of monolithic models, catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, communication bottlenecks and privacy concerns in decentralized settings, and the lack of model reuse. If successful, this P2P-MoE framework could offer a more scalable, adaptive, communication-efficient, and privacy-preserving approach to collaborative and continual learning, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the workshop call."
