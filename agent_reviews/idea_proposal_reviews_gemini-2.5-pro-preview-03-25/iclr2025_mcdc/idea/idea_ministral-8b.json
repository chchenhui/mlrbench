        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of modularity to overcome the limitations of monolithic models, mirroring the workshop's motivation. The idea explicitly mentions key topics listed in the call, including Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), converting dense models (Upcycling/MoE-fication), efficient routing algorithms (Routing of Specialized Experts), combining checkpoints (Model Soups/Merging), and applications like lifelong/continual learning and machine unlearning. It perfectly captures the spirit and scope of the workshop focused on modular, adaptive, and reusable architectures."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the main goals (developing modular architectures, converting dense models, efficient routing, combining checkpoints) are clearly stated. The expected outcomes and potential impact are also defined. While the overall concept is clear, minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific methodologies or algorithms proposed for converting models or routing. Further details on the exact techniques to be developed or compared would enhance precision, but the core idea is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by synthesizing several current research trends (MoE, PEFT, model merging, upcycling) into a coherent framework focused on adaptability and reusability. While individual components like MoE or PEFT are not new, the specific focus on converting existing dense models into modular frameworks ('MoE-fication' or 'Upcycling') and developing dynamic routing for combined, independently trained modules offers notable innovation. It represents a timely and fresh perspective on applying modularity principles comprehensively, moving beyond isolated techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. It builds upon existing and actively researched techniques like MoE, PEFT, and model merging, for which foundational work and codebases often exist. Developing efficient routing algorithms and methods for converting dense models presents research challenges but is within the realm of current ML capabilities. Implementation would require standard deep learning resources (compute, datasets, pre-trained models), but no extraordinary or currently unavailable technology seems necessary. The scope appears manageable for a focused research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It directly tackles the critical and widely recognized issues of sustainability, maintainability, and adaptability associated with large monolithic models. Developing effective modular architectures could lead to major advancements in model efficiency, reusability (e.g., in continual learning), and collaborative development. Success in this area could genuinely contribute to a paradigm shift in how large-scale models are designed, trained, and deployed, making it a highly important research direction for the field."
