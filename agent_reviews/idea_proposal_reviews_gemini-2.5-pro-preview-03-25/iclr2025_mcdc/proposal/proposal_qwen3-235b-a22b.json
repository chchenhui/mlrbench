    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of modularity, decentralization, continual learning, and model recycling/upcycling (MoErging). The methodology explicitly integrates concepts and techniques mentioned in the literature review (m2mKD, DIMAT, Subspace Distillation, Adaptive KD concepts, entropy metrics) and builds logically upon the research idea's foundation of decentralized modular knowledge distillation. The objectives and significance clearly map onto the problems outlined in the task description, such as reducing computational waste and enabling collaborative development."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure, clearly defining the background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. Key concepts like GoSE, KPP, and EGS are introduced and explained. The evaluation plan is specific. However, some technical details could be more precise, such as the exact sensitivity analysis method for KPP and the specific formulation of the gradient-space alignment metric (D_{\\\\text{align}}), which appears to have a minor notational issue or incompleteness. Despite these minor points, the overall research plan is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing multiple advanced techniques (modular architectures, diverse KD methods, dynamic routing, decentralized merging) into a unified framework specifically targeting sustainable continual learning. While individual components draw inspiration from the cited literature (m2mKD, DIMAT, etc.), the specific combination, the proposed Knowledge Preservation Protocol (KPP), the application of Entropy-Guided Selection (EGS) in this context, and the hybrid decentralized training approach represent a novel contribution. The focus on explicitly recycling knowledge from deprecated models into evolving modules within a continual learning loop is a distinct and innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, built upon established theoretical foundations (KD, modularity, CL, decentralized optimization) and leveraging existing methods (m2mKD, DIMAT principles). The methodology is well-reasoned, and the evaluation plan is appropriate, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. However, some aspects could benefit from further justification, such as the specific choice and robustness of the sensitivity analysis for KPP and the potential limitations of using only entropy for the EGS routing. The convergence properties of the complex, integrated system, especially the hybrid decentralized training, require careful theoretical analysis or strong empirical validation. The formulation for D_{\\\\text{align}} needs clarification/correction."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating multiple complex systems (GoSE, various KD methods, EGS routing, hybrid decentralized learning) requires substantial engineering effort and computational resources. Debugging and tuning such a multifaceted framework will be demanding. Simulating realistic non-IID decentralized environments adds complexity. While the components are based on existing work, their successful integration into a robust and scalable system is ambitious and carries notable risks regarding the required time and resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses highly significant and timely problems in deep learning: sustainability, model obsolescence, catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, and enabling decentralized collaboration. By aiming to recycle knowledge, reduce computational waste, and improve adaptability, the research has the potential for substantial impact on both academic research and industrial practice. The framework directly aligns with the goals of the workshop and could lead to more efficient, sustainable, and collaborative AI development paradigms. The potential societal benefits (reduced energy consumption, democratization) are also noteworthy."
