        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop task (modularity, decentralization, continual learning, model reuse/upcycling, routing). The methodology systematically incorporates the key elements outlined in the research idea (decentralized modules, knowledge preservation via distillation, entropy-based routing). Furthermore, it explicitly builds upon and synthesizes concepts from the provided literature review, citing relevant work on modular KD, decentralized training (DIMAT), continual learning techniques, dynamic routing, and knowledge preservation, while also addressing the key challenges identified."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The objectives are specific and measurable. The algorithmic components (modular architecture, KD protocol, entropy routing, decentralized training) are explained with sufficient detail, including mathematical formulations where appropriate. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies, is clearly laid out. The language is precise and technical, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several existing concepts (modularity, knowledge distillation, decentralized learning, continual learning, dynamic routing) into a coherent framework tailored for sustainable and collaborative AI. While individual components draw inspiration from the literature (e.g., modular KD, decentralized training like DIMAT, entropy metrics), the specific combination and application are innovative. Key novel aspects include the proposed knowledge preservation protocol using Fisher Information within a decentralized modular KD context and the direct use of entropy as a dynamic routing mechanism based on module specialization. It offers a fresh perspective compared to standard monolithic or simpler modular approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations like knowledge distillation, Fisher Information for parameter importance (used in methods like EWC), entropy, and federated averaging for decentralization. The proposed methodology, including the loss functions, routing mechanism, and decentralized update rule, is technically coherent and well-justified. The mathematical formulations provided are correct. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. Minor areas, like the precise mechanism for integrating preserved parameters or potential interactions between components in the decentralized setting, might require further refinement during implementation, but the overall approach is technically sound."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current deep learning technology and resources. It relies on standard datasets, metrics, and computational infrastructure (GPUs). The individual algorithmic components (KD, modular networks, federated averaging) are implementable. However, the integration of multiple complex systems (decentralized peer network, module management, dynamic routing, knowledge preservation) presents significant engineering challenges. Debugging, tuning hyperparameters (like the Fisher threshold \\\\tau, loss weights \\\\alpha, \\\\beta), and ensuring stability and convergence in the decentralized setting will require considerable effort and expertise. Communication overhead in the decentralized setting is a potential bottleneck that needs careful management. While challenging, it appears achievable within a dedicated research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses critical and timely challenges in deep learning: the unsustainability of ever-larger models, the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, and the need for more collaborative development paradigms. By proposing a framework for reusable, adaptable, and decentralized modules, it has the potential to lead to major advancements in creating more efficient, robust, and sustainable AI systems. Success would align with green AI initiatives, democratize AI development, and improve performance in applications requiring lifelong learning. The potential impact on the field is substantial."
