    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly adopts the 'Meta-Theory' idea using MAML for few-shot ToM adaptation. It thoroughly integrates and cites the provided literature, explicitly addressing the key challenges identified (Data Annotation, Generalization, Adaptation Speed, Evaluation Metrics, Ethics). The research objectives and significance directly map onto the workshop themes (Leveraging ToM for ML/NLP, ToM for HCI, Social Impacts)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated precisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. The methodology section provides detailed steps for each phase, including the MAML algorithm explanation and evaluation plan. Minor ambiguities might exist in the exact architectural details or simulation specifics, but these are acceptable for a proposal and do not hinder overall understanding."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While meta-learning (MAML) and computational ToM are existing concepts, and recent work (cited in the proposal, e.g., Johnson & Lee, Purple & Orange) explores meta-learning for personalized ToM, this proposal offers a novel synthesis by focusing specifically on *few-shot adaptation* using MAML for a dedicated ToM module within conversational agents. It presents a concrete framework ('Meta-Theory') with a detailed methodology including synthetic data generation and a comprehensive evaluation plan, distinguishing it from prior conceptual or less detailed work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid theoretical foundations (ToM, MAML) and established methods (Transformer/RNN, supervised pretraining, standard evaluation metrics). The choice of MAML for few-shot adaptation is well-justified. The methodology is detailed and logical. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, combining simulated and human studies and referencing relevant benchmarks (White & Brown, 2023). The initial reliance on synthetic data is a pragmatic choice given data challenges (Challenge 1) but is acknowledged, and human studies are planned to validate findings. Technical formulations (MAML equations) are correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. Building the synthetic data generator, implementing and tuning MAML, integrating the ToM module with a dialogue generator, and conducting human studies require significant expertise and computational resources. However, these tasks are achievable with current ML technology and standard research practices. The use of synthetic data mitigates data collection issues but introduces risks regarding realism and transferability. The scope is ambitious but broken down into logical phases."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in conversational AI: the lack of rapid personalization based on user mental states. Success would represent a major advancement in computational ToM (specifically adaptation), enhance HCI by enabling more empathetic and effective agents, and provide valuable techniques for NLP/ML. The potential applications in customer service, education, and healthcare are substantial. It directly aligns with the goals of creating more socially aware AI and addresses key challenges in the field."
