        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on computational modeling of ToM, especially with natural language, and its application areas. The idea proposes exactly this: a computational framework (recursive architecture, Bayesian updates, transformers) for ToM, aimed specifically at improving Human-AI Collaboration, which is explicitly listed as a workshop topic ('ToM for HCI / Human-AI collaboration'). It also touches upon 'Leveraging ToM for Machine Learning Applications' by aiming to enhance AI systems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained (limitations of current AI in ToM for collaboration). The core concept of 'recursive ToM modeling' (AI models human, AI models human's model of AI) is defined. The proposed methodology (Bayesian belief updating + transformers trained for mental state discrepancies) provides a high-level technical direction. Expected outcomes are also listed. While specific architectural details or training data requirements are not elaborated, the overall research direction and goal are clearly understandable with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While ToM in AI is an existing research area, the specific focus on *recursive* ToM modeling (going beyond simple first-order ToM) for human-AI collaboration is less common and offers a fresh perspective. The proposed combination of Bayesian belief updating with transformers specifically trained to predict mental state discrepancies for this recursive task represents a novel methodological integration. It builds upon existing concepts but combines them in an innovative way to tackle a more complex level of ToM."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building and training a system capable of robust recursive mental state tracking is complex. It requires sophisticated modeling, potentially large datasets capturing nuanced human-AI interactions, and effective ways to represent and update beliefs about beliefs. Training transformers to accurately predict mental state discrepancies is non-trivial and depends heavily on data quality and labeling. While the component technologies (Bayesian methods, transformers) exist, integrating them for this specific, complex task requires considerable research effort and may face hurdles in data acquisition and evaluation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Improving human-AI collaboration is a critical challenge in AI development. The lack of sophisticated ToM in AI is widely recognized as a major bottleneck leading to misunderstandings and inefficient interactions. Successfully developing AI with recursive ToM could lead to major advancements in how humans interact with AI systems, making collaboration more natural, intuitive, and effective across various domains (e.g., education, software development, creative tasks). The potential impact on HCI and AI capabilities is substantial."
