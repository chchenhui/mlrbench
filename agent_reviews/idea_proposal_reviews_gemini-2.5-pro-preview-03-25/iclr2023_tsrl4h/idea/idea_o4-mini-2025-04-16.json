        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses key themes: time series representation learning for health, labeling challenges with expert time constraints (active learning), handling high-dimensionality, missing values, and irregularity (pediatric ICU data, imputation-aware augmentations), the need for robust and interpretable methods (contrastive learning robustness, prototype layer), and focusing on a specific challenging application area (pediatrics, ICU). It explicitly aims to make research actionable in clinical practice."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (contrastive learning, active learning, interpretability layer), and goals (label reduction, accuracy improvement) are clearly stated. The proposed methodology combining these elements is understandable. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact nature of the 'imputation-aware augmentations' or the specific 'prototype module' architecture, but the overall concept is well-defined and comprehensible."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While contrastive learning, active learning, and prototype-based interpretability are existing concepts, their specific combination tailored for pediatric ICU time series with imputation-aware augmentations and a clinician-in-the-loop active learning strategy presents a novel approach. The innovation lies in the synergistic integration and adaptation to address the specific challenges of this domain, rather than introducing a fundamentally new technique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core components (contrastive learning models, active learning algorithms, prototype networks) rely on established ML techniques. Implementation requires access to pediatric ICU data and clinician time for annotation, which are significant but common requirements in clinical ML research. The proposal acknowledges the need to minimize clinician burden via active learning. Integrating the components and tuning the system will require effort, but it appears achievable with current ML expertise and resources, assuming data and clinical collaboration are secured."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant with clear impact potential. It tackles critical problems in clinical time series analysis: label scarcity, lack of robustness, and the need for interpretability to gain clinician trust. Focusing on pediatric ICU data, a vulnerable population where data is often limited and decisions are critical, enhances its importance. Success could lead to more reliable and trustworthy AI tools for clinical decision support in pediatrics and potentially other critical care settings, directly addressing the workshop's goal of actionable research."
