    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key themes: labeling efficiency (via active learning), handling missing/irregular data (via imputation-aware contrastive learning), interpretability (via prototype-based explanations), and focusing on a minority group (pediatrics/ICU). The methodology clearly implements the research idea of combining contrastive SSL, active learning, and interpretability. It also positions itself well against the cited literature, aiming to overcome limitations identified (e.g., lack of clinician feedback, need for label efficiency)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific and measurable (e.g., 60% label reduction, 12% AUC improvement). The methodology sections describe the core components (data, encoder, augmentations, active learning strategy, interpretability module) and the experimental setup logically. The structure is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism of the transformer handling missingness beyond referencing STraTS or the specifics of the clinician interface, but these do not significantly hinder understanding at the proposal stage."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating three distinct areas—imputation-aware contrastive SSL, clinician-in-the-loop active learning, and prototype-based interpretability—into a unified framework specifically for pediatric ICU time series. While individual components (contrastive learning, active learning, ProtoPNet) exist, their synergistic combination tailored to address the specific challenges of sparse labels, missing data, and trust in this critical care setting is novel. The 'imputation-aware' augmentations and the direct integration of clinician feedback into the SSL loop are key innovative aspects."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, active learning principles, transformer architectures like STraTS, prototype learning via ProtoPNet). The proposed methodology, including the contrastive loss, uncertainty-diversity sampling, and prototype generation, is well-justified. The experimental design is robust, featuring relevant baselines, standard evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. Technical formulations like the loss function are correctly presented. Minor assumptions regarding the optimality of specific augmentations or active learning metrics are present but acceptable for a proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It utilizes standard deep learning techniques (transformers, contrastive learning) implementable with common hardware/software. Using MIMIC-III provides a readily available starting point. However, feasibility is moderately constrained by the need to secure access to the PHIS database and establish a hospital partnership for the custom cohort collection (including IRB approval). Securing clinician time for the active learning loop, while central to the proposal, is a practical challenge common in clinical ML research. The overall scope and technical requirements are realistic for a focused research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical, unmet needs in clinical time series analysis: reducing annotation burden, handling complex real-world data (missing, irregular), and enhancing model trustworthiness for clinical adoption. The focus on pediatric critical care targets an important, vulnerable, and often under-resourced population group, aligning perfectly with the workshop's call. Success would offer substantial contributions towards making advanced ML actionable in high-stakes clinical environments, potentially improving patient outcomes through better prediction models and providing a valuable framework for other low-data healthcare domains."
