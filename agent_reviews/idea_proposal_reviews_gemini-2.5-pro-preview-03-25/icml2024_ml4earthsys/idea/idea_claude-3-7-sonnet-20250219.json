        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on hybrid physics-ML climate models, using ML to emulate subgrid processes, and highlights uncertainty quantification as a key topic. The research idea directly proposes a hybrid physics-ML model for subgrid processes with a core focus on uncertainty quantification (specifically for extreme events, another challenge mentioned in the task description regarding HILL events). It addresses the limitations of pure ML (extrapolation) and physics models (resolution) as outlined in the workshop summary."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of current models for extreme events), the main approach (hybrid physics-ML with ML for subgrid processes), the key technical innovation (probabilistic NNs using evidential deep learning for aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty), and the intended outcome (reliable projections with confidence intervals, flagging HILL events, enabling better decision-making). The concepts are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While hybrid physics-ML models and uncertainty quantification in climate science are existing research areas (even mentioned in the task description), the specific proposal to integrate evidential deep learning for explicit separation and calibration of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty within a hybrid climate model framework, specifically targeting the challenging problem of HILL events and using physical constraints for calibration, offers a fresh and sophisticated approach. It combines existing concepts in a novel way to address a specific, difficult problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Implementing hybrid physics-ML models requires substantial expertise in both climate modeling and machine learning. Training advanced probabilistic models like evidential deep learning networks requires significant computational resources and careful tuning. Integrating and calibrating these ML components within large-scale climate simulations, ensuring physical consistency, and validating the uncertainty quantification add complexity. However, the underlying techniques (physics models, ML frameworks, UQ methods) exist, making it achievable within a well-resourced research environment, albeit requiring considerable effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Improving the projection of extreme climate events, particularly high-impact, low-likelihood ones, is critical for societal adaptation and risk management. Providing robust uncertainty quantification alongside these projections, as proposed, would greatly enhance their trustworthiness and utility for policymakers. Addressing the limitations of both pure physics-based and pure ML approaches in this domain could lead to major advancements in climate modeling and our ability to prepare for future climate impacts."
