        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (Behavioral Machine Learning workshop focusing on integrating behavioral science/cognitive models into AI), the research idea (Cognitive Architecture-Guided Training), and the literature review (building on CoALA, LLM-ACTR, etc., and addressing identified challenges). It directly proposes incorporating computational cognitive models (ACT-R, CLARION) into LLMs to improve alignment and interpretability, fitting squarely within the workshop's scope. It elaborates precisely on the core concepts outlined in the research idea and explicitly aims to tackle challenges like alignment, scalability, and evaluation mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. Objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology is broken down into logical steps (Data Collection, Cognitive Architectures, Hybrid Training, Constrained Decoding, Evaluation) with specific techniques and even equations provided for key components like the loss function and decoding guidance. The rationale and significance are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the proposed research immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the general concept of integrating cognitive architectures with LLMs exists in the literature (e.g., LLM-ACTR, CoALA framework), this proposal introduces specific novel methodological contributions. These include: 1) The complementary use of two distinct architectures (ACT-R and CLARION) tailored to different task types. 2) A specific hybrid loss function combining standard LM loss with cognitive alignment losses based on trace matching (KL divergence on activations/attention) and step consistency (contrastive loss). 3) A specific constrained decoding mechanism involving a cognitive state tracker and guided beam search with a fallback strategy. 4) The use of RL for dynamic hyperparameter tuning. These specific technical approaches differentiate it clearly from the cited prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established cognitive architectures (ACT-R, CLARION) and standard LLM techniques (fine-tuning, hybrid loss, constrained decoding, RL). The proposed methodology, including the hybrid loss components (KL divergence, contrastive loss) and the guided beam search, is theoretically plausible and well-justified within the context of aligning LLM behavior with cognitive processes. The evaluation plan includes relevant metrics and ablation studies. Minor uncertainties exist regarding the precise implementation details of aligning cognitive model activations with LLM hidden states for the KL divergence, but the overall technical approach is robust and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Key requirements include: 1) Access to diverse datasets (psychological experiments, crowdsourcing) and the capability to generate high-quality synthetic cognitive traces using ACT-R/CLARION simulators. 2) Expertise in both LLMs and cognitive modeling. 3) Substantial computational resources for fine-tuning LLMs and running simulations. 4) Careful engineering to implement the hybrid loss (especially the trace matching component) and the constrained decoding mechanism. While ambitious, these challenges are typical of cutting-edge interdisciplinary research and seem surmountable with adequate resources and expertise. The plan is generally realistic, with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical challenge in AI: the lack of transparent, human-like reasoning in LLMs, which hinders trust and adoption in high-stakes domains. By grounding LLMs in validated cognitive models, the research has the potential to lead to major advancements in AI alignment, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. The expected contributions (novel framework, datasets, models) and potential applications (education, healthcare, teaming) are substantial and clearly articulated, promising meaningful impact on both AI research and society."
