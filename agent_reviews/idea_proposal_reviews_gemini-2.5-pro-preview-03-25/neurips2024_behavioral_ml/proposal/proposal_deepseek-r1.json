        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of integrating behavioral science insights (specifically, computational cognitive models like ACT-R) into AI systems. It elaborates precisely on the research idea, detailing the hybrid training and constrained decoding mechanisms. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, citing key papers (e.g., CoALA, LLM-ACTR, Binz & Schulz) and explicitly aiming to tackle challenges identified in the review, such as alignment, evaluation, and balancing performance with interpretability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The technical aspects, including the hybrid loss function and the constrained decoding mechanism, are presented with mathematical formulations, enhancing clarity. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is specific and easy to understand. The structure is logical, making the proposal readily comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While integrating cognitive models/architectures with LLMs is an active area (as shown in the literature review), the proposed approach combines specific techniques in a novel way. The combination of a hybrid training objective using KL divergence on reasoning step distributions derived from cognitive models *and* a constrained decoding mechanism actively guided by cognitive model predictions at inference time appears innovative. This goes beyond simple fine-tuning on behavioral data [2] or higher-level architectural integration [1, 4] by proposing a tighter coupling at both training and inference stages, specifically targeting step-by-step reasoning alignment."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established cognitive architectures (ACT-R/CLARION) and standard LLM techniques. The proposed methodology (hybrid loss, KL divergence, constrained decoding) is technically plausible and well-justified within the context of machine learning and cognitive science integration. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including task performance, behavioral congruence metrics, and user studies. Minor weaknesses exist in the assumptions about the ease of generating precise step-by-step cognitive model predictions (p_{\\text{cog}} or C_t) that align perfectly with LLM token sequences across diverse tasks, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. It requires significant expertise in both LLMs and cognitive modeling, access to specialized datasets (some requiring curation), and substantial computational resources. Key challenges include: 1) Generating accurate and scalable cognitive model traces (p_{\\text{cog}}, C_t) for diverse reasoning tasks. 2) Efficiently integrating the cognitive model predictions into the LLM's decoding loop without excessive latency. 3) Carefully tuning the hyperparameters (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) to balance alignment and task performance. While ambitious, these challenges seem surmountable within a dedicated research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of making LLM reasoning more transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human cognitive processes. Success would represent a major advancement in trustworthy AI, bridging cognitive science and machine learning. The potential applications in high-stakes domains like education and healthcare are substantial. By providing a concrete framework and addressing known limitations [4, 6], the research could have a strong influence on the future development of human-centered AI systems."
