        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (ICML Workshop on Next Gen Sequence Models). It directly addresses core workshop themes like the limitations of existing models (Transformers vs. SSMs), long-range context modeling, improving architectures, efficiency, and hardware trade-offs. The proposal to combine SSMs and attention mechanisms fits squarely within the scope, particularly mentioning SSMs (Mamba) and improved architectures as key topics."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the motivation (Transformer/SSM trade-off), the proposed architecture (hybrid SSM/sparse attention with gating), the mechanism for adaptation (learned gating based on lightweight features), the training strategy (two-phase, budget-aware loss), and the expected outcomes (perplexity, inference speed). The components and their interactions are explained concisely with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While hybrid architectures exist, and combining SSMs with attention is an emerging trend (e.g., Griffin, Hawk), the core novelty lies in the *dynamic* routing of tokens via a *learned gating mechanism* based on token-level features (position, entropy, saliency). This adaptive computation approach, specifically tailored to switch between SSM and attention pathways based on predicted need, offers a fresh perspective compared to static hybrid structures or simple layer alternation. The budget-aware loss further adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It leverages existing and well-understood components like state-space models (e.g., Mamba blocks), sparse attention mechanisms, and gating networks. Computing the proposed lightweight features for gating is practical. The two-phase training approach is standard. While engineering the integration and tuning the gating mechanism might require moderate effort, there are no apparent fundamental barriers related to current technology or knowledge. Standard ML infrastructure should suffice."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It tackles the critical and persistent challenge of efficiently modeling long sequences while retaining strong local reasoning capabilities. If successful, it could lead to models that are both more performant (better perplexity on mixed tasks) and more efficient (faster inference on long sequences) than current state-of-the-art approaches. Such adaptive architectures could influence future model design and enable scaling to longer contexts under hardware constraints."
