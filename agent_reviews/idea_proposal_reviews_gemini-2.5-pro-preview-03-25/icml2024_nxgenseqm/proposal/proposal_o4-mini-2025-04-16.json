    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on next-generation sequence models, particularly memory limitations, long-range context, SSMs, scaling, and efficiency. The methodology precisely implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea (dual-memory SSM, adaptive controllers, RL optimization, extreme lengths). Furthermore, the proposal effectively situates itself within the provided literature, referencing key works (SMR, Mamba, LMNs, Jamba) and explicitly tackling the identified challenges like memory retention, efficiency, and adaptive management. All components are tightly interwoven and consistent."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the overall structure (Intro, Lit Review, Methodology, Expected Outcomes) is logical. The methodology section provides good detail on the architecture, including mathematical formulations for key components like the SSM update, importance signals, and retrieval mechanism. The inclusion of pseudocode further enhances clarity. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of the 'Compress' function (though options are suggested) and the exact formulation of the RL reward signal, but these do not significantly obscure the core proposal. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While components like SSMs, external memory, and RL exist independently, their specific integration here—a dual-tier (fast cache + compressed long-term) memory system coupled with an SSM core, managed by RL-trained controllers optimizing for importance and downstream task performance—represents a novel approach. This contrasts with existing methods like SMR's replay buffer, Mamba's lack of external memory, LMN's fixed hierarchy, or Jamba's hybrid attention/SSM approach. The focus on adaptive, importance-driven memory management via RL for extreme-length sequences (up to 1M tokens) is a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established foundations like SSMs (S4/Mamba), memory-augmented networks, and reinforcement learning. The architectural design is logical, separating fast working memory from compressed long-term storage. The use of attention for retrieval and simple neural networks for controllers is standard. The RL formulation as an MDP is appropriate. However, some areas could benefit from further justification or detail, such as the specific compression method's impact, the precise RL reward function design, and potential interactions or instabilities arising from coupling the SSM dynamics, memory updates, and RL optimization. The assumption that simple importance signals derived solely from the current hidden state are sufficient might need validation. The evaluation plan is comprehensive."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the individual components (SSMs, attention, RL algorithms) are known, integrating them into a cohesive, stable, and efficient system (ADM-SSM) is complex. Training the RL controllers effectively, especially for long sequences where rewards are sparse or delayed, can be difficult. Scaling the system to handle 1M token sequences poses substantial computational and memory hurdles, likely requiring significant hardware resources and optimization effort. The overall complexity introduces considerable risk regarding successful implementation and achieving the projected performance gains within a typical research timeframe."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical and widely acknowledged challenge of modeling extreme-length sequences (100K-1M tokens), a key limitation of current state-of-the-art models. Successfully developing a model that efficiently retains and utilizes information over such lengths would enable breakthroughs in various domains like long-document understanding, large codebase analysis, and genomics. The proposed adaptive dual-memory paradigm, if validated, could influence future sequence model architectures. The potential contributions, including empirical results on extreme-length benchmarks and open-sourced artifacts, would be substantial for the field and align perfectly with the workshop's themes."
