    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on memory limitations in sequence models (SSMs like Mamba), long context, and improving architectures. The core idea of a dual-memory system managed by RL controllers perfectly matches the research idea provided. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to overcome the key challenges (memory retention, efficiency, adaptive management, scalability) identified in the literature review, positioning itself relative to recent works like Mamba, Jamba, SMR, and LMNs. The proposed experiments and applications fit well within the scope outlined by the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to methodology and expected impact. The core concepts (SSM base, WM, LTM, RL controller) are explained, and the methodology includes mathematical formulations and a detailed experimental plan. However, some minor ambiguities exist: the exact mechanism for LTM compression beyond 'LSTM' could be more specific, the precise state/action space and reward function details for the RL controller could be elaborated, and the choice of DDPG for what appears to be a probabilistic/discrete action (store/don't store) might need clarification or justification (perhaps a policy gradient method is intended). Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like SSMs (Mamba), memory systems, and RL controllers exist, their specific integration into a dual-memory (dynamic WM cache + compressed LTM) architecture managed by RL agents for adaptive memory allocation in extreme-length sequences appears novel. It distinguishes itself from prior work like SMR (state adjustment) or LMNs (structural efficiency) by focusing on learned, dynamic control over distinct working and long-term memory stores, optimized via task performance. The combination of importance-based WM updates, LSTM-based LTM compression (though simple), and RL-driven control over the memory hierarchy integrated with an SSM backbone represents a fresh approach to the long-sequence memory problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established principles (SSMs, memory networks, RL). The motivation is strong, and the experimental design is rigorous (baselines, metrics, ablations). However, there are areas needing further justification or refinement. The LTM compression using a single LSTM layer seems potentially simplistic for capturing complex long-term dependencies. The RL component, while conceptually sound, presents practical challenges: the choice of DDPG for the described action space needs clarification, reward sparsity from task metrics could make training difficult (though Monte Carlo estimates are mentioned), and ensuring stable convergence requires careful design. The theoretical claims (formal guarantees, bounds) are ambitious. Overall, the core approach is plausible, but specific implementation details, particularly concerning the RL controller and LTM, require more rigorous development."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating the SSM, dual-memory system, and RL controller into an efficient architecture is complex. Training the RL component effectively, especially with potentially sparse rewards over extreme-length sequences (1M tokens), will be demanding and require substantial computational resources and expertise. Achieving the target efficiency (â‰¤15% overhead compared to standard SSMs) while adding these complex memory components seems ambitious and might require significant optimization effort. While the research plan is well-defined, the technical complexity and computational cost associated with the RL training and scaling introduce considerable risks to successful execution within typical research constraints."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and critical bottleneck in AI: enabling models to effectively retain and utilize information over extreme-length sequences. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially unlocking new capabilities in fields like multi-document analysis, genomics, and long-term AI agent memory. The potential contributions span both empirical performance (SOTA on long-context tasks) and conceptual understanding (dynamic, task-aware memory systems). The problem is timely and relevant, and a breakthrough would have broad implications across multiple domains."
