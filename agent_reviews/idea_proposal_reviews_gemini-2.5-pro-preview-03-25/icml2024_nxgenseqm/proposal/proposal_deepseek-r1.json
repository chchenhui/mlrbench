    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on memory, long-range context, limitations of current models (SSMs like Mamba), improving architectures, efficiency, and downstream applications (language, vision, bio). It faithfully translates the research idea's core concepts (hybrid SSM, dual-memory, controllers, RL optimization) into a detailed plan. Furthermore, it builds upon and distinguishes itself from the cited literature (Mamba, SMR, Jamba, LMNs), positioning the work within the current research landscape and addressing the key challenges identified in the review, such as memory retention, efficiency, and adaptive management for extreme sequence lengths."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall architecture, training strategy, and experimental design are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The use of equations helps define components like the SSM backbone and Working Memory. However, some finer details could benefit from refinement, such as the specific structure of the hierarchical LTM, the exact mechanism for LTM retrieval (similarity search details), and the specifics of the RL policy/algorithm used for memory resource optimization. Despite these minor points, the core concepts and research plan are communicated effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it builds upon existing concepts like SSMs (Mamba), memory networks (inspired by LMNs/SMR), and RL, the specific combination is novel. The core innovation lies in the hybrid architecture integrating an SSM backbone with a dynamic dual-memory system (WM/LTM) governed by differentiable controllers, and particularly the use of RL to explicitly optimize memory allocation based on downstream task performance for extreme-length sequences. This approach differs significantly from cited works like Mamba (lacks explicit external memory hierarchy), SMR (different focus), Jamba (Transformer+SSM blocks), and standard memory networks. The proposal clearly articulates how this combination aims to overcome limitations of prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established principles of SSMs, memory augmentation, attention mechanisms, and reinforcement learning. The mathematical formulations for the SSM and WM are standard. The overall architectural design is plausible. However, the integration of multiple complex components (SSM, WM, LTM autoencoder, attention controllers, RL optimization) introduces potential challenges. The stability of the end-to-end training, especially the interplay between the task loss, memory fidelity loss, and the RL penalty, requires careful handling and justification. The LTM compression based solely on reconstruction error might be suboptimal for preserving semantic importance. While generally well-founded, the complexity raises moderate concerns about potential instability or the need for significant tuning, slightly reducing the soundness score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While it relies on existing technologies (SSMs, PyTorch/TensorFlow, RL libraries), integrating the complex dual-memory system with controllers and RL optimization into an efficient SSM backbone will require substantial engineering effort. Training such a model on sequences exceeding 100K tokens demands significant computational resources (GPU memory, time). Ensuring stable training, particularly the RL component, and effectively tuning the numerous hyperparameters (decay factors, thresholds, RL rewards) pose considerable risks. The ambitious performance targets (15-30% improvement, <50% memory overhead vs. Mamba) add to the challenge. While conceptually possible, successful implementation is not straightforward and carries moderate risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in current AI: effective reasoning and memory utilization over extremely long sequences. Success would represent a major advancement in sequence modeling, potentially enabling breakthroughs in processing long documents, hour-long videos, genomic data, and facilitating lifelong learning agents. The research directly tackles fundamental questions about memory-computation trade-offs and scaling laws, contributing valuable theoretical insights. The potential for broad applicability across diverse domains and the focus on improving efficiency for large models underscore its high significance."
