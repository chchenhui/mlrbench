    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on cross-domain XAI applications, transferability challenges, and future directions. It comprehensively elaborates on the core research idea of using meta-learning for transferable explanation modules. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging relevant prior/concurrent work (meta-learning for XAI) and explicitly aiming to tackle the identified key challenges like domain-specificity and transferability of XAI methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The research objectives, methodology (MAML-based approach, data domains, architecture overview, loss function, evaluation plan), and expected outcomes are articulated effectively. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of 'expert annotations' across diverse domains, specific architectural details of the explainer network components, and the exact definition of the fidelity loss term (though referenced). The user study description is also brief. However, these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the literature review indicates that meta-learning for XAI is an emerging area, this proposal's specific focus on creating a *universal* explainer network (E_\\\\theta) designed to transfer explanation capabilities across *heterogeneous* domains (vision, tabular, NLP) using a gradient-based meta-learning framework like MAML appears innovative. It moves beyond domain-specific or modality-specific applications towards a more general, adaptable XAI solution. The novelty lies in the specific framework (MetaXplain) and its ambitious cross-modal scope."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (MAML for meta-learning) and established XAI concepts/metrics (infidelity, sensitivity). The proposed bi-level optimization methodology is appropriate for the stated goal of rapid adaptation. The mathematical formulations seem correct. The evaluation plan includes relevant metrics and baselines. A potential weakness is the strong assumption that universal explanation patterns exist and are learnable by a single architecture across highly diverse data types (image, tabular, text), which requires robust empirical validation. The reliance on potentially subjective 'expert annotations' (e_{\\\\text{gt}}) also needs careful handling."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. The primary hurdle is data collection: acquiring or creating datasets with consistent, high-quality expert explanation annotations (e_{\\\\text{gt}}) across three diverse source domains and two test domains is demanding and potentially costly. Public datasets with such annotations are scarce. Meta-training (especially MAML) can be computationally intensive. While the technical implementation is achievable with standard tools, the data requirement poses a substantial risk. The 12-month timeline appears optimistic given these challenges, particularly data acquisition and annotation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in practical XAI deployment: the difficulty and cost of creating explanation methods for new domains. By aiming to develop transferable explanation modules, MetaXplain has the potential to dramatically accelerate the adoption of transparent AI in diverse fields, promote standardization, and lower barriers for organizations. Success would represent a major advancement in applied XAI and contribute significantly to research on meta-learning and interpretability, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
