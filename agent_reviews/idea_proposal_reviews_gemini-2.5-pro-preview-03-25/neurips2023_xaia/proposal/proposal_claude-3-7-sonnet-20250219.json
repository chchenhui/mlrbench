    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the task description: the domain-specificity of XAI methods and the need for transferring insights across use cases. The research idea of using meta-learning for transferable explanations is faithfully and comprehensively developed in the proposal. The methodology builds upon concepts (meta-learning for XAI, MAML) and addresses challenges (domain dependency, data scarcity, evaluation) identified in the literature review. All components are tightly integrated and focused on the central theme of transferable XAI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of data collection, the meta-learning framework (including architecture, training procedure, loss functions, and regularization techniques), adaptation strategy, and a comprehensive experimental design. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated and quantified where appropriate. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the project's goals and approach."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the literature review indicates existing work on meta-learning for XAI and transferable explanation modules, MetaXplain proposes a specific, comprehensive framework using MAML adapted for explanation generation across a particularly diverse set of domains (vision, NLP, tabular, medical, financial). The combination of MAML for this specific task, the proposed regularization techniques (domain adversarial, contrastive learning on explanation embeddings), and the ambitious scope of cross-domain transfer constitutes a novel contribution. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as related ideas exist, but it offers a fresh and well-specified approach to a known problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in meta-learning (MAML) and established XAI concepts and evaluation metrics. The proposed methodology, including the base explainer architecture concept, meta-training loop, loss function components, and regularization techniques, is technically plausible and well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive and uses appropriate metrics (faithfulness, localization, rank correlation) and includes human evaluation. Minor areas for further specification exist (e.g., exact architecture details, precise definitions of some loss components), but the overall technical approach is robust and well-reasoned."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The primary challenge lies in collecting diverse, high-quality annotated datasets (1000+ samples with expert annotations across 5 domains). This is ambitious and potentially resource-intensive. Designing a single base explainer architecture that effectively handles diverse data modalities (images, text, tabular) and explanation formats is technically complex. While MAML and the proposed techniques are implementable, achieving effective few-shot adaptation (5-20 samples) across such varied domains requires strong empirical validation. The planned human evaluation is also resource-intensive. The project is feasible in a well-funded environment but carries notable risks related to data acquisition and technical complexity."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in XAI â€“ the lack of transferability and scalability of explanation methods across domains. Successfully developing MetaXplain would represent a major advancement, potentially democratizing XAI, improving consistency, accelerating adoption in new and critical fields, reducing resource requirements, and contributing to a more unified understanding of explainability. The potential impact on research, practice, and regulatory compliance is substantial and clearly articulated."
