    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the task (domain-specificity, data scarcity, transferability of insights across use cases) and the literature review (domain tailoring, data scarcity, evaluation, transferability). The proposed MetaXplain framework is a direct elaboration of the research idea, detailing the methodology and expected outcomes. It explicitly positions itself against the cited literature, aiming to bridge identified gaps (e.g., focusing on transferring explanation patterns, rigorous cross-domain validation). The objectives and significance clearly connect to the workshop's themes, particularly topics 1-3 (applications), 5 (new domains), and 7 (transferable insights), and challenge 4 (evaluation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from motivation and objectives to methodology and expected impact. Key concepts like MetaXplain, MAML-based training, the model architecture (Encoder, Meta-Explanation Module, Adaptation Layer), source/target domains, and evaluation metrics (AOPC) are clearly explained. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides sufficient detail, including technical formulations for the forward pass and meta-loss, making the proposed approach readily understandable. While minor details like the exact implementation of the cross-modal explanation module could be further elaborated, the overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While leveraging existing concepts like meta-learning (MAML) and XAI techniques, the core idea of applying gradient-based meta-learning specifically to train *transferable explanation modules* across *diverse data modalities* (images, text, tabular) for *few-shot adaptation* appears novel. The proposal effectively distinguishes itself from cited works like FIND (algorithm selection explanation) and MetaQuantus (evaluation), and claims advancements over potentially similar but less detailed works (Refs 5-10) by emphasizing the transfer of explanation *patterns*, rigorous cross-domain validation, and explicit few-shot adaptation mechanisms (like adapters). The combination of these elements constitutes a fresh approach to tackling domain specificity and data scarcity in XAI."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in meta-learning (MAML) and established XAI evaluation practices (faithfulness metrics like AOPC, Deletion/Insertion, human judgments). The proposed methodology, including the modular architecture (Encoder-Module-Adapter), MAML training procedure, and adaptation strategy, is technically well-founded. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, incorporating quantitative metrics, baselines, ablation studies, and human-in-the-loop experiments. Technical formulations are presented correctly. The main assumption—that transferable, domain-invariant explanation patterns exist and are learnable—is a reasonable research hypothesis central to the proposal. Minor potential weaknesses include the challenge of ensuring metric comparability across different explanation types (maps, vectors, weights) and modalities, but the overall approach is robust."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily related to data acquisition. Curating paired datasets (inputs, model outputs, *expert annotations*) across 3-5 diverse source domains (healthcare, finance, law, climate) and 2 target domains is highly ambitious. Obtaining consistent, high-quality expert annotations at scale is notoriously difficult, time-consuming, and potentially expensive. While the proposal mentions using existing datasets like CheXpert, securing comparable annotations for all proposed domains (especially financial risk, legal text, climate science, rare diseases, LiDAR) is a major hurdle. The technical implementation of the MetaXplain framework itself using standard ML tools is feasible, and computational resources, while significant, are likely manageable. However, the dependency on extensive, high-quality, multi-domain expert annotations makes the overall feasibility satisfactory rather than good or excellent, posing a considerable risk to successful execution within a typical project timeframe."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and widely recognized bottlenecks in the practical application of XAI: domain-specific limitations and the high cost/data requirements for deployment in new areas. By aiming to create transferable explanation modules adaptable with few shots, the research has the potential to dramatically accelerate XAI adoption, particularly in data-scarce or emerging fields (like rare diseases, legal analytics). Success would lead to more consistent transparency standards across industries and could democratize access to XAI. The potential scientific contributions, including the MetaXplain framework, a multi-domain benchmark dataset, and insights into domain-invariant interpretability principles, are substantial and align well with advancing the XAI field and the workshop's goals."
