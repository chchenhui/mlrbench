    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on cross-domain XAI applications, transferability of insights, and overcoming deployment challenges like domain specificity. The MetaXplain idea is faithfully translated into a detailed plan. The proposal effectively uses the provided literature to establish the research gap (lack of comprehensive cross-domain meta-learning for XAI) and explicitly targets key challenges identified (Domain-Specific Tailoring, Data Scarcity, Transferability)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The background, problem statement, objectives, methodology (including the MAML-based algorithm steps and equations), and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise architecture handling diverse modalities (though the concept is mentioned) and the practical details of standardizing varied explanation types (maps, vectors) and conducting qualitative user studies, but these do not significantly obscure the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the literature review indicates prior work on meta-learning for XAI (in specific contexts like GNNs, recommendations, or conceptually for few-shot/transferability), this proposal outlines a specific, comprehensive framework (MetaXplain) using gradient-based meta-learning (MAML-style) explicitly aimed at achieving *cross-domain transfer* across *diverse data modalities* (images, text, tabular). The proposed empirical validation of this broad cross-domain transferability appears less explored than domain-specific or single-modality few-shot XAI, representing a novel contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous. It builds upon established foundations (MAML, standard XAI evaluation metrics like faithfulness). The methodology includes appropriate meta-task definitions, loss functions, baselines, and evaluation metrics (quantitative and qualitative). However, there are potential weaknesses: the assumption that a single architecture (even with modality-specific heads) can effectively learn universal explanation patterns across highly diverse domains needs strong validation. The reliance on obtaining consistent and reliable 'ground-truth' or 'proxy-ground-truth' explanations across these domains is a significant challenge acknowledged but not fully resolved, potentially impacting the robustness of evaluation. The technical details of the explainer architecture itself are somewhat high-level."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. The primary bottleneck is data curation: assembling datasets from 3-5 diverse source domains and 2-3 target domains, each requiring not just data and model predictions, but also *reliable* ground-truth or proxy-ground-truth explanations, is highly demanding and potentially expensive. Standardizing these explanations is also non-trivial. Furthermore, meta-training complex models across diverse datasets requires significant computational resources (GPU clusters). While the technical implementation using existing libraries is possible, the data acquisition and preparation phase poses substantial risks and effort, making the overall plan ambitious."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical bottleneck in the practical application of XAI: the domain-specificity and high cost associated with developing explainability solutions for new domains or tasks. If successful, MetaXplain could dramatically accelerate the deployment of trustworthy AI, promote consistency in explanation standards, and make XAI more accessible, especially in resource-constrained settings. This directly addresses the workshop's goals of advancing applied XAI and exploring cross-use-case transferability, potentially leading to major advancements in the field."
