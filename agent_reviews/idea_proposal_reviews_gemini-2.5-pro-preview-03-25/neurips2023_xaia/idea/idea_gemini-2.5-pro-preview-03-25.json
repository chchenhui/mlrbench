        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description. The workshop focuses on XAI applications, challenges, methodological requirements, and future directions, particularly in sensitive domains. This idea directly addresses a major challenge (privacy) hindering XAI application in domains like healthcare and finance (mentioned implicitly/explicitly in the task), proposes a novel methodological approach (Federated Explainability) tailored for these settings, and explores future applications of XAI under privacy constraints. It tackles obstacles (privacy risks) and proposes a way to overcome them, fitting the workshop's aim to devise ways to progress the field."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently articulated. The motivation (privacy risk in XAI for sensitive domains), the core concept (Federated Explainability framework), the proposed mechanism (local computation of explanation components, secure aggregation), examples (SHAP/LIME, gradients, perturbations, secure aggregation/DP), and expected outcomes (privacy-preserving XAI, transparency, trust) are all clearly defined and easy to understand. There is minimal ambiguity in the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While Federated Learning, XAI methods (LIME, SHAP), and privacy techniques (Secure Aggregation, DP) exist independently, the proposed framework integrates them in a specific way to solve the problem of generating *local* explanations collaboratively without sharing raw data. Adapting local XAI methods to produce securely aggregatable components within an FL setting represents a novel contribution beyond simply applying FL principles to model training or generating only global explanations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents notable technical challenges. It leverages existing technologies (FL, XAI algorithms, privacy techniques). However, adapting local explanation methods like LIME/SHAP to work in this federated, component-sharing manner requires significant research and development. Ensuring the fidelity of aggregated explanations, managing the computational and communication overhead of secure aggregation, and carefully balancing the privacy-utility trade-off are key challenges that require careful investigation and engineering effort. It's achievable but not straightforward."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. It addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying trustworthy AI in sensitive, high-impact domains like healthcare and finance where data privacy is paramount. Enabling explainability in Federated Learning settings would be a major advancement, fostering trust, facilitating debugging, enabling audits, and potentially accelerating the adoption of complex ML models in these regulated fields. The potential impact on responsible AI deployment is substantial."
