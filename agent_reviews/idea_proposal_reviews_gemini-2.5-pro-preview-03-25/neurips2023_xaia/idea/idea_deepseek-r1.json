        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly lists 'Explore whether insights gained from one use case can be transferred to other use cases' as a key topic for the workshop. The research idea directly addresses this by proposing a systematic evaluation of XAI method transferability across domains, developing a framework for adaptation, and identifying transferable components. It also touches upon other workshop topics like identifying limitations, methodological requirements, and applying XAI to new domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (siloed XAI), the main objective (evaluate transferability), the proposed methodology (case studies, metrics, framework development, hybrid benchmarks), and the expected outcomes (taxonomy, guidelines, tools). The concepts are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity, making the research direction immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While cross-domain transfer learning is established, systematically evaluating the transferability of *XAI methods* themselves, developing a dedicated framework to identify transferable *explanation components* versus domain constraints, and using hybrid benchmarks specifically for this purpose offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond applying XAI within domains to understanding the fundamental principles governing their cross-domain applicability."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate challenges. Implementing case studies across diverse domains (e.g., healthcare, law) requires access to varied datasets and potentially domain-specific expertise. Developing a novel framework and robust hybrid benchmarks requires significant technical effort. However, the proposed methods (evaluation metrics, case studies) rely on existing concepts, making the project achievable with adequate resources, collaboration, and careful planning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the siloed nature of XAI development could prevent redundant research efforts and accelerate the adoption of trustworthy AI in new, critical domains (like climate science or education, as mentioned). Understanding transferability is crucial for building more robust, generalizable, and reliable XAI. The proposed guidelines and tools could become valuable resources for the broader AI/ML community, directly contributing to advancing applied XAI."
