        "justification": "The XAIBridge idea aligns excellently with the task description. The workshop explicitly aims to 'Explore whether insights gained from one use case can be transferred to other use cases,' which is the central theme of XAIBridge. The idea directly addresses the need to understand XAI applications across diverse domains (healthcare, science, etc.), identify common challenges, and devise strategies to progress the field by facilitating knowledge transfer, perfectly matching the workshop's objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (lack of cross-pollination), the main components (ontology, domain adaptation, repository), and the goal (accelerate adoption, reduce costs) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The inclusion of specific examples further enhances understanding. The proposed steps provide a clear roadmap for the research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While domain adaptation and XAI methods exist independently, the proposal to create a systematic framework specifically for transferring *XAI insights* and developing *domain adaptation techniques for XAI methods* while preserving fidelity is innovative. Creating an ontology mapping XAI effectiveness across domains and a repository of successful transfers represents a fresh approach to addressing the siloed nature of applied XAI research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate challenges. Creating a comprehensive ontology requires extensive literature review and potentially meta-analysis across diverse domains. Developing robust domain adaptation techniques for XAI methods that demonstrably preserve explanation fidelity is a non-trivial research task. Building and maintaining the repository also requires significant effort. However, the components rely on existing concepts in ML and XAI, making it achievable with dedicated resources and research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a critical bottleneck in applied XAI â€“ the lack of knowledge sharing and redundant efforts across domains. If successful, XAIBridge could accelerate the development and adoption of effective XAI practices, reduce research and development costs, and foster a more unified understanding of explainability challenges and solutions across different fields, leading to meaningful contributions."
