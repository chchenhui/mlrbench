        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly aims to 'Explore whether insights gained from one use case can be transferred to other use cases,' which is the central theme of the proposed 'Transferable XAI' framework. The idea also touches upon other workshop goals, such as discussing future applications (by enabling rapid deployment in new domains), identifying obstacles (fragmentation, 'explanation silos'), and exploring methodological requirements (proposing a meta-framework). It directly addresses the need to advance applied XAI across different domains like healthcare, law, and fairness auditing, as mentioned in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation effectively explains the problem of fragmented XAI applications. The main idea outlines a structured approach involving a knowledge graph, a cross-domain generator, and validation. However, the specifics of how the knowledge graph would be constructed and utilized, and the precise mechanisms of the cross-domain explanation generator using causal reasoning and contrastive learning, could be elaborated further for perfect clarity. While understandable, some technical details remain somewhat abstract."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While transfer learning is established in ML, the concept of a dedicated 'meta-explainability framework' specifically designed to transfer XAI insights and patterns across diverse domains (like healthcare, law, NLP) is innovative. Using techniques like knowledge graphs and causal reasoning for *explanation transfer* represents a fresh perspective compared to typical XAI research focused on developing or evaluating methods within single domains. It moves beyond domain-specific solutions towards generalizable principles of explainability."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Constructing a comprehensive, annotated knowledge graph mapping explanations across diverse domains requires substantial effort in data collection, standardization, and annotation, which could be a major bottleneck. Training a sophisticated cross-domain generator using causal reasoning and contrastive learning is technically complex, though potentially achievable with current AI capabilities. Validation depends heavily on the success of the preceding steps. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation requires considerable resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the practical application of XAI â€“ the lack of generalizability and the resulting redundant effort across domains. A successful framework for transferable XAI could dramatically accelerate the development and deployment of explainable AI systems, foster cross-disciplinary understanding of transparency and bias, improve auditing practices, and potentially lead to more robust and trustworthy AI across various sectors. The potential to create domain-agnostic templates and benchmarks would be a major contribution."
