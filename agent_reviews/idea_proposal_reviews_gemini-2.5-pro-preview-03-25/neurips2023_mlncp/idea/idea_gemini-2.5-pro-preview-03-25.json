    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the need for co-designing ML models with non-traditional hardware (specifically analog compute). It focuses on tackling the key challenges mentioned in the task, such as inherent noise and device mismatch in analog systems, by proposing algorithms that embrace these characteristics. The goal of achieving efficient and reliable ML on emerging accelerators aligns perfectly with the workshop's aims."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined (overcoming analog noise), and the core proposal (using Bayesian learning to model weight distributions informed by hardware noise) is understandable. It clearly states the expected benefits (robustness, uncertainty quantification, potential regularization). Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific adaptations needed for MCMC/variational methods for analog non-idealities, but the overall concept is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While Bayesian Neural Networks are an established field, applying them specifically as a co-design strategy to model and potentially leverage the inherent noise statistics and non-idealities of *analog* hardware is innovative. Framing hardware uncertainty not just as a problem to mitigate but as a feature to incorporate into the Bayesian posterior offers a fresh perspective compared to standard deterministic approaches or simple noise injection techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Bayesian methods, particularly MCMC, can be computationally intensive, potentially conflicting with the efficiency goals of analog hardware, especially during training. Accurately characterizing and modeling the complex noise profiles and non-linearities of analog devices across an entire chip is non-trivial. Adapting Bayesian inference algorithms to operate effectively under analog constraints (e.g., limited precision) requires significant research effort. Access to suitable analog hardware or highly accurate simulators is also necessary."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Analog computing holds immense promise for energy-efficient ML, but hardware imperfections are a major barrier. Developing methods that make models robust to or even exploit these imperfections, as proposed here, could unlock the potential of analog AI accelerators. The inherent uncertainty quantification from the Bayesian approach adds further value for building reliable systems. Success in this area would represent a major advancement in making non-traditional computing paradigms practical for widespread ML deployment."
