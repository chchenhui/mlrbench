    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the HAIC 2025 workshop task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on feedback loops in human-AI coadaptation, long-term interactions, and moving beyond simple performance metrics. Specifically, it aligns perfectly with Subject Area 1 ('Human-AI Interaction and Alignment', particularly 'Evolution of human expectations and trust in AI systems') and also strongly relates to Area 6 ('Dynamic Feedback Loops in Socially Impactful Domains') by mentioning high-stakes contexts like healthcare. The focus on 'trust inflation' as a consequence of iterative feedback and adaptation is central to the HAIC theme."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly defines the problem ('trust inflation') and the gap in current research (lack of focus on dynamic trust evolution). The main idea is well-defined, outlining a longitudinal framework with specific, understandable goals (track, identify, mitigate) and methods (empirical studies, computational modeling, specific measures). The concepts are explained concisely, and the expected outcomes are clearly stated. There is minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While research on trust in AI exists, the specific focus on 'trust inflation' as a potentially negative outcome of AI adaptation within iterative feedback loops is a relatively fresh perspective. Proposing a longitudinal study specifically to track this phenomenon and developing targeted mitigation strategies like 'trust calibration interrupts' adds innovative elements. It moves beyond static trust assessment towards understanding potentially problematic dynamics in co-adaptive systems, which is less explored."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. Longitudinal empirical studies are inherently resource-intensive, requiring sustained participant engagement and careful experimental control over extended periods. Measuring implicit trust accurately and isolating the specific AI behaviors causing 'inflation' can be complex. Computational modeling of trust dynamics is feasible but requires careful validation. The proposed mitigation strategies seem technically implementable. Overall, it's feasible within a well-resourced research project but requires significant effort and careful methodological design."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance. Understanding and mitigating misplaced trust or over-reliance on AI systems is crucial for safety and effectiveness, especially in high-stakes domains explicitly mentioned (healthcare, legal). As AI systems become more adaptive and integrated into daily life, the potential for 'trust inflation' becomes a critical concern. Developing models of dynamic trust evolution and evidence-based design principles for maintaining calibrated trust would be a major contribution to the fields of Human-AI Interaction, AI Alignment, and AI Safety, directly addressing core concerns of the HAIC workshop."
