        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the HAIC 2025 workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of Human-AI Coevolution, focusing on feedback loops, continuous coadaptation, and long-term dynamics. It specifically targets high-stakes domains like criminal justice, mentioned explicitly in the call (Subject Areas #3, #6). The proposal tackles bias and fairness (#2, #7), societal impact (#3), dynamic feedback loops (#6), and ethical implications (#1, #7), all central themes of the workshop. It moves beyond static benchmarks to explore dynamic bias trajectories, fitting the workshop's emphasis on temporal aspects and bidirectional learning (#4)."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation effectively highlights the gap in current research (static vs. dynamic bias). The main components of the proposed framework (ABM, RL, adaptive debiasing, validation) are outlined. The expected outcomes are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities might exist in the specifics of integrating counterfactual reasoning and preference-aware RLHF within the adaptive debiasing loop, or the precise nature of the 'participatory simulations', but the overall research direction and methodology are well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While research exists on AI bias, agent-based modeling, and RL, the core novelty lies in integrating these to specifically model the *coevolutionary dynamics* of bias amplification and mitigation over time within human-AI systems. Focusing on 'dynamic bias trajectories' and adaptive debiasing that responds to these temporal shifts, rather than static snapshots, offers a fresh perspective. The proposed combination of ABM for interaction simulation, RL for adaptation, and specific techniques like counterfactual reasoning and preference-aware RLHF for dynamic debiasing constitutes an innovative approach to this problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing realistic agent-based models of human decision-making and adaptation, especially concerning bias, is complex and requires careful calibration. Training adaptive RL agents for debiasing within this simulated environment can be computationally intensive and sensitive to model parameters. Accessing sufficiently detailed historical criminal justice data for validation might be difficult due to privacy regulations and data availability. Conducting meaningful participatory simulations with legal experts requires significant logistical effort and careful design. While the individual components (ABM, RL, bias metrics) are established, their integration into a robust, validated framework for dynamic bias coevolution is ambitious and requires considerable effort and potentially specialized expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely issue of bias amplification in AI systems deployed in high-stakes societal domains like criminal justice and healthcare. By moving beyond static bias analysis to model dynamic coevolutionary effects, it tackles a fundamental limitation of current approaches. Successfully developing a framework to predict and mitigate bias trajectories could lead to major advancements in ethical AI, providing crucial tools for auditing, designing, and deploying fairer and more robust human-AI systems. The potential impact on policy and practice in socially sensitive areas is substantial."
