    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (HAIC 2025 workshop themes like coevolution, feedback loops, bias, healthcare, trust, long-term impact), the research idea (modeling/mitigating bias in healthcare loops using RL, causal mediation, looping inequity metric), and the literature review (citing relevant papers on feedback loops, bias-aware RL, causal mediation, trust, longitudinal studies, and the specific metric). It directly addresses the workshop's call by focusing on dynamic feedback loops, bias, fairness, and long-term impact in a high-stakes domain (healthcare), integrating concepts mentioned in the provided literature."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure with distinct sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology is detailed, outlining three distinct phases with specific techniques (RL setup, patient modeling, causal mediation, validation study design) and even includes relevant mathematical formulations for key concepts. The language is precise and academic, making the proposal readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating reinforcement learning, causal mediation analysis, and dynamic patient trust modeling into a cohesive 'bias-aware co-correction' framework specifically designed to address long-term human-AI coevolution and bias mitigation in healthcare feedback loops. While individual components (RL, causal analysis, trust modeling) exist, their synthesis into a dynamic, bidirectional correction mechanism that adapts to evolving patient behavior and algorithmic performance over time is innovative. It moves beyond static fairness interventions discussed in the literature. The application and validation of the 'looping inequity' metric within this comprehensive framework also adds value, even if the metric itself was recently proposed elsewhere (as cited)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in reinforcement learning, causal inference (mediation analysis), fairness in machine learning, and human-computer interaction (trust). The proposed methodology, including the RL setup (PPO, fairness penalty), patient behavior modeling (Bayesian updates, logistic trust model), causal mediation (SEM), and dynamic adjustment mechanism, is technically plausible and well-justified for the problem. The validation plan involving a longitudinal study with appropriate statistical analysis (mixed-effects models, causal forests) adds rigor. Minor weaknesses include the inherent simplifications in patient behavior models and the potential challenges in robustly estimating causal effects in a dynamic loop."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Accessing large-scale, longitudinal, diverse EHR data (N=10,000) and collecting corresponding survey data over 18 months is demanding due to privacy, logistics, cost, and participant retention. Generating high-quality synthetic data via GANs adds complexity. Integrating and stabilizing the complex system involving RL, dynamic causal analysis, and trust modeling requires substantial technical expertise and computational resources. While conceptually sound, the ambition of the project, particularly the 18-month validation study, raises concerns about practicality within typical research constraints without significant dedicated resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of bias amplification within dynamic human-AI feedback loops, particularly in the high-stakes domain of healthcare where such biases can exacerbate health disparities. Developing a framework that can dynamically mitigate bias during coevolution could lead to major advancements in deploying fair and effective AI systems. The potential impact on clinical practice (more equitable AI tools), policy (guidelines for adaptive AI), and AI research (advancing HAIC methodologies) is substantial. The expected outcome of significantly reducing disparities (25-40%) highlights its potential importance."
