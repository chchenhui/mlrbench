    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (HAIC 2025 workshop themes like long-term coevolution, feedback loops, bias, fairness, healthcare, RL, trust), the research idea (modeling/mitigating bias in healthcare feedback loops using simulation, RL, causal mediation, XAI, looping inequity metric), and the literature review (building on concepts like bias-aware RL, causal mediation, XAI, dynamic loops, and addressing cited challenges). It directly tackles the core concepts requested by the workshop, elaborates precisely on the research idea's components, and positions itself clearly within the context of the provided literature."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, flowing from background and problem statement to specific objectives, a detailed methodology (including mathematical formulations and pseudocode), and expected outcomes. The language is precise, technical concepts are explained well, and there is minimal ambiguity. The objectives are distinct, and the methodology provides a clear roadmap for implementation and evaluation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits high originality by integrating reinforcement learning, dynamic causal mediation analysis, and explainable AI into a cohesive 'bias-aware co-correction' mechanism specifically designed to address bias amplification in long-term human-AI coevolutionary loops. While individual components exist (as shown in the literature review), their dynamic integration within the feedback loop to track and correct bias mediated by behavior, coupled with trust calibration via explanations, represents a significant novel contribution. The proposed application and validation of the 'looping inequity' metric also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (MDPs for RL, causal mediation principles, SHAP for XAI). The methodology is well-described, technically detailed (including formulations and pseudocode), and appropriate for the research questions. The experimental design includes relevant baselines, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and plans for statistical validation. Minor details, like the exact update rule for the fairness correction term (`Î”_corr`), could be slightly more explicit, but the overall approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard tools and techniques (Python, PyTorch, DoWhy, SHAP) and achievable data requirements (augmented EHR data, simulation). The primary challenge lies in the complexity of integrating multiple advanced techniques (RL, causal inference, XAI) into a dynamic simulation loop and ensuring the simulation's fidelity. However, the plan is detailed, and conducting the study within a simulation environment is a practical approach for investigating long-term dynamics ethically and controllably. The scope appears ambitious but achievable for a dedicated research effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem: the potential for AI systems in healthcare to amplify societal biases through dynamic, long-term feedback loops. This issue has profound ethical and practical implications. The research promises substantial contributions, including a novel framework for bias mitigation, a deeper understanding of human-AI coevolution, a new validated metric, a reusable simulation toolkit, and actionable guidelines for deploying more equitable AI. The potential impact on AI fairness research, healthcare practice, and policy is transformative."
