        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key themes of the workshop: large pre-trained models in robotics, the challenge of efficient fine-tuning (especially with limited hardware), generalization to novel tasks/environments, combining different data modalities (vision, language, proprioception), modular adaptation mechanisms (sparse updates via adapters), and safe deployment (mentioned as a benefit). It fits squarely within the specified areas of interest."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (computational cost of full fine-tuning), the core proposal (sparse cross-modal adaptation using adapters on identified pathways), the evaluation context (robotic manipulation, limited data), and the expected impact are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. Minor details about the exact mechanism for identifying sparse pathways could be further specified, but the overall concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters and sparsity concepts exist, the specific proposal to apply sparsity *selectively to cross-modal interaction pathways* within large multimodal robotic models is innovative. It's not just applying standard PEFT but tailoring it to the structure of multimodal learning in robotics, focusing on identifying and adapting only the most relevant inter-modal connections. This offers a fresh perspective on efficient adaptation for this domain."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It builds upon existing concepts like pretrained multimodal models, adapter modules, and attention mechanisms. Implementing sparse updates and adapter integration is technically achievable. The main challenges would be accessing suitable large pretrained models and diverse robotic datasets/environments for evaluation, which might require significant computational resources, and potentially refining the method for reliably identifying the most task-relevant cross-modal pathways. However, no fundamental technological barriers prevent its implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Efficiently adapting large pretrained models is a critical bottleneck for their practical deployment in real-world robotics, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. By drastically reducing the number of trainable parameters and potentially enabling faster adaptation with less data, this research could make powerful models more accessible, reduce the computational cost (and carbon footprint) of fine-tuning, and contribute to safer, more interpretable model updates. It addresses a key challenge highlighted by the workshop."
