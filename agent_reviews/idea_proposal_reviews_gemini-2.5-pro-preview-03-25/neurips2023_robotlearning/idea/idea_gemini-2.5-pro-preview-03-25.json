    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key themes of the workshop call, including 'finetuning, or other modular adaptation mechanisms for deploying pre-trained models on a new environment', 'efficiently perform this fine-tuning, typically with limited hardware', and 'ensuring a safe deployment'. The proposal tackles the explicitly stated open research question regarding efficient and safe fine-tuning for large models in robotics, making it highly relevant."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation is concisely stated, the core concept (integrating safety constraints into PEFT) is unambiguous, and specific examples of PEFT methods, constraints, and implementation approaches (constrained optimization, penalty terms) are provided. The expected outcome is clearly articulated, making the proposal immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While PEFT methods and safety constraints in robotics exist independently, the specific proposal to integrate safety constraints *directly within* the optimization process of parameter-efficient fine-tuning for large pre-trained models in robotics offers a fresh perspective. It combines existing concepts in a novel way to address a specific challenge in robot learning."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. PEFT techniques are established, and implementing constrained optimization or loss penalties is standard in ML. Defining basic safety constraints (joint limits, simple collision checks) is practical. Access to pre-trained models and robotic simulation/hardware is necessary but typical for this research area. The main challenge lies in formulating effective constraints that guarantee safety without excessively hindering task performance, which seems achievable through careful design and experimentation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses two critical barriers to deploying large models in real-world robotics: computational/data efficiency during adaptation (via PEFT) and operational safety (via integrated constraints). Successfully developing such a method could greatly facilitate the practical and reliable use of powerful pre-trained models across various robotic applications, especially in resource-constrained or safety-critical scenarios."
