    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the Robot Learning workshop task (large models, fine-tuning, generalization, safety, parameter efficiency, offline data). It faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the 'Safe Adapters' concept. Furthermore, it situates the work effectively within the context of the literature review, leveraging concepts from adapter-based tuning (Sharma et al., 2023) and safe RL (Liu et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024) while aiming to address the identified challenges like safety during deployment and computational constraints."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The research objectives are explicitly stated as questions. The methodology is presented logically with a clear two-phase structure (pre-training, fine-tuning), specific techniques (adapters, contrastive loss, CMDP, CQL, shielding), and mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including benchmarks, platforms, and metrics, is clearly outlined. An algorithm outline further aids understanding. While minor implementation details could always be added, the core concepts, approach, and evaluation plan are communicated with high precision and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing existing techniques in a novel framework. While adapters, contrastive learning, safe RL (CQL, shielding), and VLPMs are individually established, their specific combination into a two-stage 'Safe Adapter' framework explicitly designed for safe, parameter-efficient fine-tuning of VLPMs in robotics is innovative. The novelty lies in integrating safety mechanisms (CQL critic, shield) directly within the adapter-tuning loop, preceded by a contrastive pre-training step to align semantics with control embeddings for these adapters. This specific approach is distinct from the cited literature, which either focuses on adapters without explicit safety RL integration or safe RL without the parameter-efficient VLPM adaptation focus."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (VLPMs, parameter-efficient tuning, contrastive learning, CMDPs, Conservative Q-Learning, safety shields). The proposed methodology, combining contrastive pre-training for initialization and safety-constrained RL for fine-tuning, is logical and well-justified for the stated objectives. The technical formulations provided (InfoNCE, RL loss structure) are appropriate. The reliance on CQL for safety estimation and shielding is a recognized approach in safe RL. Assumptions regarding offline data quality and critic accuracy are standard in the field and acknowledged implicitly through the experimental validation plan."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible. The core idea of using lightweight adapters (<5% parameters) makes the claim of rapid fine-tuning (<1hr on a single GPU) plausible and addresses computational constraints. The required components (frozen VLPMs, standard simulation environments like RoboSuite/Habitat, common robotic hardware like Franka/TurtleBot, RL algorithms like CQL) are accessible within the research community. Data collection for pre-training is a necessary effort but standard practice. While integrating all components (adapters, contrastive loss, safe RL loop, shield) involves engineering effort, it doesn't require breakthroughs in fundamental technology. The main risks involve the empirical effectiveness of the safety mechanisms and achieving the desired sample efficiency, which are typical research risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: enabling the safe and efficient deployment of powerful large-scale VLPMs on resource-constrained robotic systems. This is a major bottleneck hindering the practical application of recent AI advances in real-world robotics. Success would have a substantial impact by democratizing access to large models for robotics researchers and practitioners, potentially accelerating progress in areas like warehouse automation and assistive robotics. The focus on formal safety guarantees during learning and deployment is particularly crucial and impactful for real-world adoption. The theoretical and practical contributions outlined are substantial."
