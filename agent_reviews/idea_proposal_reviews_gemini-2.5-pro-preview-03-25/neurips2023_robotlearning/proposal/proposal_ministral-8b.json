        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of pre-training, fine-tuning (specifically adapter-based), generalization, safety, and parameter efficiency for large vision-language models in robotics. The methodology clearly follows the research idea, detailing the use of safety adapters, contrastive pre-training, and safety-constrained RL fine-tuning. Furthermore, it explicitly aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as balancing adaptation and model integrity, data efficiency, safety guarantees, computational constraints, and generalization. There are no significant inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, with defined objectives, methodology sections, and expected outcomes. The overall concept of safety adapters and the two-phase approach (pre-training, fine-tuning) is understandable. However, some technical details could be more precise. For instance, the exact architecture and placement of the 'safety adapters' are not specified. More importantly, the connection between the 'learned critic that vetoes high-risk actions' and the provided 'safety-constrained Q-learning objective' formula isn't explicitly drawn; the formula appears closer to a standard or conservative Q-learning update rather than directly incorporating a shielding mechanism. The claim of 'provable safety guarantees' also lacks detail on how these guarantees would be formally established."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating two distinct research streams: adapter-based fine-tuning for VLMs and safe reinforcement learning for robotics. While both adapters and safe RL are established areas (as shown in the literature review), the core idea of designing and training 'safety adapters'—lightweight modules specifically updated via safety-constrained RL to ensure safe adaptation of a frozen VLM backbone—appears novel. This specific synthesis, focusing safety constraints onto the adaptable parameters while leveraging the frozen VLM's semantic capabilities, offers a fresh perspective compared to full fine-tuning or applying safety constraints to the entire policy network."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound theoretical foundations, leveraging established techniques like VLMs, adapter tuning, contrastive learning, and reinforcement learning. The overall methodology is logical. However, there are minor weaknesses in rigor. The technical formulation for the safety-constrained Q-learning objective (`L_safety`) doesn't fully capture the described mechanism involving a 'learned critic that vetoes high-risk actions'; its precise mathematical link to safety enforcement (e.g., shielding, constrained optimization) is unclear from the provided formula. Additionally, the claim of 'provable safety guarantees' is very strong and typically requires specific formal methods or strong assumptions, which are not detailed in the proposal, slightly weakening the claim's rigor at this stage."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and typical resources available in robotics/ML research labs. Adapter-based tuning is known for its parameter and computational efficiency, aligning with the goal of rapid adaptation (<1 hour). Contrastive learning and RL frameworks are readily available. Access to pre-trained VLMs, offline robotic data, and target hardware are necessary but standard prerequisites for this research area. The main challenges lie in the practical implementation and rigorous validation of the safety mechanisms during RL on physical hardware, which always carries inherent risks, and potentially in sourcing adequate pre-training data. The ambitious performance targets add some uncertainty, but the core approach is implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in robotics: how to safely and efficiently adapt powerful, large pre-trained models (VLMs) for real-world tasks under resource constraints. Solving the challenges of high fine-tuning costs, safety risks during deployment, data inefficiency, and generalization is critical for unlocking the potential of large models in robotics. If successful, the proposed method could substantially lower the barrier to entry for using VLMs, improve robot safety, and accelerate deployment, making a considerable impact on the field as highlighted by the workshop's focus."
