    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses multiple key topics from the workshop call (Multimodal Time Series Models, Leveraging Pretrained Models, Analysis of Pretrained Models, Real-World Applications). The methodology clearly operationalizes the research idea of using modality-specific encoders, cross-modal attention, and adaptive weighting. It explicitly references and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as modality integration complexity and attention mechanism design. The objectives and expected outcomes are tightly linked to the overall goal of enhancing time series forecasting using multimodal data in the age of large models."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The methodology section provides substantial detail on data sources, preprocessing, the AMAF architecture (including mathematical formulations for key components like encoders and attention), training procedures, and a comprehensive evaluation plan. The language is precise and technical, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While multimodal time series forecasting using attention and pre-trained models is an active research area (as evidenced by the literature review), the proposal's specific contribution lies in the proposed AMAF architecture. The combination of bidirectional cross-modal attention followed by an adaptive modality weighting mechanism (dynamic gating based on context/representations) offers a potentially more sophisticated fusion strategy than static methods or simpler attention schemes mentioned in the background and literature [1, 4]. However, the core concepts (cross-attention, gating) are known techniques. The novelty is thus more in the specific architectural design and combination rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (Transformers, attention mechanisms) and leverages state-of-the-art pre-trained models (PatchTST, BERT) appropriately. The proposed methodology, including the cross-modal attention and adaptive weighting, is technically plausible. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, standard and robustness-focused metrics, ablation studies, and interpretability analysis. Technical formulations are provided and appear correct. Minor gaps exist, such as the precise architecture of the gating network, but the overall approach is well-justified and rigorous."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It plans to use publicly available datasets and standard machine learning techniques/libraries. The core components (Transformers, attention) are well-understood. However, challenges exist: 1) Acquiring and perfectly aligning high-quality multimodal datasets across different domains can be difficult, as acknowledged. The plan to use semi-synthetic data is a reasonable mitigation. 2) Training large models like AMAF (potentially fine-tuning LLMs) requires significant computational resources (GPUs, time), although the proposal mentions PEFT as a possible mitigation. 3) Implementing and debugging the complex interaction between modalities and the adaptive weighting might require careful engineering. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable with appropriate resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a critical limitation of traditional time series models â€“ their inability to leverage rich contextual information from other modalities. Improving forecasting accuracy and robustness, especially during critical events (market crashes, grid failures), has substantial real-world value in domains like finance, energy, and healthcare, aligning well with the workshop's interest in applications. The research also contributes to understanding how to effectively integrate large pre-trained models from different domains for time series tasks and tackles important challenges like dynamic fusion and interpretability in complex models."
