        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for multimodal time series models that leverage pretrained models from other modalities (NLP/CV foundation models like BERT/ViT). It elaborates the core research idea by proposing a specific architecture (MAFT) with cross-modal attention and adaptive weighting. Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as modality integration, attention design, and interpretability, citing relevant recent works like Time-VLM and Modality-aware Transformer."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The architecture components (encoders, fusion, weighting, head) are described, and mathematical notations add precision. The experimental design is well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist in the exact implementation details of the cross-modal attention interaction and the adaptive gating mechanism, but these do not significantly hinder the overall comprehension of the proposed approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While leveraging pretrained models (BERT, ViT) and attention mechanisms for multimodal fusion is becoming more common (as seen in Time-VLM, Modality-aware Transformer), the specific combination proposed in MAFT, particularly the hierarchical attention structure (intra-modal followed by cross-modal with TS as query) and the explicit 'Adaptive Modality Weighting' module using a learnable gating mechanism to dynamically adjust modality influence based on context/quality, offers a fresh perspective. It builds upon existing work but introduces specific architectural choices aimed at improving dynamic fusion and robustness, distinguishing it from the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (attention mechanisms, convolutional networks, transformers) and utilizes established, powerful pretrained models (BERT, ViT) and time series techniques (TCN). The proposed methodology, including modality-specific encoding, hierarchical attention fusion, and adaptive weighting, is logical and technically plausible. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Technical formulations are provided and appear generally correct, though some implementation details are high-level. The approach directly addresses challenges mentioned in the literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Accessing and preprocessing multimodal datasets (TTC, M5, financial data) is achievable but requires effort. The core technologies (TCN, BERT, ViT, Attention) are readily available in standard libraries. However, training the proposed MAFT architecture, which integrates multiple large pretrained models and complex attention mechanisms, will be computationally intensive, requiring significant GPU resources. Implementation complexity is also considerable. While challenging, these aspects are typical for research involving large foundation models and are manageable within a well-resourced research environment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of effectively integrating diverse data modalities into time series forecasting, which has the potential to significantly improve prediction accuracy, especially in complex systems and during anomalous events often driven by external factors captured in text or images. By exploring the synergy between time series analysis and foundation models from NLP/CV, it contributes directly to a key research frontier highlighted by the workshop. Success would lead to more robust forecasting models with broad applications in finance, healthcare, energy, and retail, and the insights into adaptive multimodal fusion would be valuable for the scientific community."
