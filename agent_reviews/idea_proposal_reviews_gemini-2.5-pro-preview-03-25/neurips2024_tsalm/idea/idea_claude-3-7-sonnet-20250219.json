    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses two key topics listed in the workshop scope: 'Leveraging Pretrained Models of Other Modalities for Time Series' by proposing the use of pre-trained transformers for text/vision, and 'Multimodal Time Series Models' by focusing on fusing numerical time series with contextual information from other modalities. The motivation and approach align perfectly with the workshop's theme of exploring time series in the age of large models and incorporating exogenous information."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of unimodal TS models), the core proposal (multimodal fusion via attention using pre-trained encoders), and the expected benefit (enhanced forecasting, especially during anomalies). Key components like modality-specific encoders, cross-modal attention, and adaptive weighting are mentioned. While specific architectural details are not fully elaborated, the overall concept and approach are understandable with only minor ambiguities."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While multimodal time series analysis and attention mechanisms are not entirely new, the specific proposal to use pre-trained foundation models (transformers) as encoders for non-numerical modalities within a dedicated cross-modal attention framework for time series forecasting offers a fresh perspective. The adaptive weighting mechanism and the focus on enhancing robustness during anomalies/regime changes add to the originality. It represents a timely combination and adaptation of recent advancements in large models for the time series domain, rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core components (pre-trained transformers, attention mechanisms, time series models) are well-established building blocks in machine learning. Implementation is practical with standard deep learning frameworks. However, challenges exist: acquiring or creating suitable aligned multimodal time series datasets can be difficult, and training such a complex architecture involving large pre-trained models will require significant computational resources and expertise in handling different data modalities."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Addressing the limitation of traditional time series models by incorporating rich contextual information from other modalities could lead to substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy and robustness, particularly for complex systems influenced by external events (e.g., finance, retail, energy). Success in this area would represent a meaningful contribution to time series analysis, making forecasting models more reliable and informative in real-world scenarios, aligning well with the goals of advancing time series research in the era of large models."
