        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's key topic 'Multimodal Time Series Models' by proposing a method to integrate text data with time series. Furthermore, it relates to 'Building Time Series Foundation Models' by suggesting a novel pretraining framework, and its focus on downstream tasks and interpretability touches upon 'Real-World Applications' and 'Analysis of Pretrained Time Series Models'. The motivation clearly fits the workshop's goal of advancing time series research in the era of large models by incorporating exogenous information."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation outlines the problem (lack of multimodality in current TSFMs) effectively. The main idea clearly describes the proposed solution (CrossModalTS), including the architecture (dual-encoder transformer), data requirements (paired time series and text), pretraining objectives (masked reconstruction, MLM, contrastive alignment), and intended downstream applications. The expected outcomes (accuracy, robustness, interpretability) are also clearly stated. It is concise and immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While multimodal learning using dual-encoders and contrastive objectives is established in other fields (e.g., vision-language), applying this specifically to pretrain a *foundation model* for general-purpose time series analysis incorporating text is a novel contribution within the time series domain. Most existing time series foundation models focus solely on numerical sequences. This work proposes a new direction by systematically integrating textual context during pretraining, which is a fresh perspective compared to most current TSFM research."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning data. Assembling a large-scale, diverse dataset with accurately aligned time series (sensor streams) and corresponding textual data (logs, notes, reports) across multiple domains is a major undertaking. Data collection, cleaning, and alignment would require substantial effort and resources. While the proposed model architecture (transformers) and pretraining techniques are standard and implementable with sufficient compute resources, the data acquisition bottleneck lowers the feasibility score. Assuming the data challenge can be overcome with significant effort, the rest is reasonably feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a critical limitation of current time series models by incorporating valuable contextual information from text, which is often available in real-world applications (healthcare, finance, predictive maintenance). Success could lead to substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy, anomaly detection performance, and robustness. Furthermore, the potential for enhanced interpretability via cross-modal attention mechanisms addresses a key weakness of complex time series models. This research could pave the way for more effective and interpretable multimodal time series analysis."
