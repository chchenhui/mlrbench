        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the workshop's scope. It directly addresses two key topics: 'Leveraging Pretrained Models of Other Modalities for Time Series' (using BERT for text) and 'Multimodal Time Series Models' (integrating numerical time series and textual data). Furthermore, it fits the overall theme of 'Time Series in the Age of Large Models' by employing Transformer architectures and focusing on real-world applications like healthcare, another listed topic. The motivation and proposed solution are highly relevant to the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The motivation, the core components of the proposed Cross-Modal Transformer (dual-encoder with patched Transformer and BERT, cross-attention, contrastive loss), the target application (healthcare/finance), and the expected outcomes (improved forecasting, interpretability) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. While specific implementation details are naturally omitted in a summary, the overall concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While multimodal Transformers and cross-attention mechanisms exist, applying them specifically to integrate asynchronous, unstructured textual context (like clinical notes or news) with numerical time series for forecasting is a relatively less explored area compared to using structured exogenous variables. The proposed combination of a patched time series Transformer, a pretrained LM, cross-attention, and a temporal-aware contrastive loss represents a novel synthesis of techniques tailored to this specific challenge. It offers a fresh perspective on leveraging rich textual data for time series tasks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core components (Transformers, BERT, cross-attention, contrastive learning) are well-established techniques with available implementations. Pretrained language models like BERT are accessible. While combining time series data (e.g., MIMIC-III signals) with corresponding textual data (clinical notes) requires significant data preprocessing and alignment effort, this is a known challenge in the field and achievable. Training the proposed model will require substantial computational resources (GPUs), which is standard for large model research but generally manageable within research labs."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and impact potential. Effectively integrating unstructured textual context with time series data addresses a critical limitation of many current forecasting models, especially in domains like healthcare (clinical notes) and finance (news articles) where such context is vital but often ignored. Success could lead to substantial improvements in prediction accuracy (e.g., earlier sepsis detection) and provide more holistic insights. The work could establish a strong benchmark and methodology for multimodal time series analysis, making a meaningful contribution to the field."
