        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the intersection of ML, compression, and information theory, specifically targeting distributed compression, theoretical understanding, and information-theoretic principles. The proposal accurately reflects the core research idea of using MI regularization within a VAE framework for neural DSC. It effectively builds upon the cited literature, acknowledging existing neural DSC methods ([1, 4]) and MI techniques ([7, 10]), while positioning itself to address key challenges identified (theoretical grounding, complex correlations)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and experimental plan are presented logically. The core concept of MI regularization within a VAE framework is explained, and the objective function is defined mathematically. The algorithmic steps are outlined sequentially. Minor areas could benefit from refinement: the exact nature of the 'continuous extension of Slepian-Wolf bounds' (Objective 1) and the derivation of the theoretical rate-distortion inequality are high-level; additionally, the handling of multi-way MI estimation (N>2) beyond the pairwise InfoNCE example is not detailed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While VAEs and MI estimation are known techniques, and neural DSC is an active area ([1, 2, 4]), the specific proposal to use explicit MI *maximization* between latent representations of distributed sources as the core regularization principle within a VAE framework appears novel. Furthermore, the explicit aim to derive theoretical rate-distortion bounds linking MI regularization strength (\\beta_{MI}) to Slepian-Wolf-like efficiency for continuous sources distinguishes it from prior empirical or architecture-focused neural DSC works. It offers a fresh, theoretically-motivated perspective."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, based on established VAE principles and information theory concepts (MI, rate-distortion). The proposed objective function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, and MI regularization is plausible. However, the theoretical analysis section presents a rate-distortion inequality without derivation or rigorous justification of its connection to Slepian-Wolf (which is typically lossless) versus lossy rate-distortion theory for correlated sources (like Wyner-Ziv). The claim that maximizing latent MI directly minimizes source redundancy needs careful framing. While the overall approach is methodologically sound, the theoretical claims require significant rigorous development and validation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core components (VAEs, InfoNCE for pairwise MI) are standard in deep learning and implementable with existing libraries. The proposed datasets are publicly available benchmarks. Training such models is computationally intensive but standard for ML research. Potential challenges include the effective estimation and optimization of MI (especially multi-way MI for N>2), potential training instabilities from the combined objective, and the successful derivation of the proposed theoretical bounds. However, these are research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks, making the project generally feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical need for efficient distributed compression, particularly relevant for IoT, federated learning, and multi-sensor/view applications where bandwidth is constrained. Bridging the gap between high-performing but often heuristic neural compression methods and foundational information theory (like Slepian-Wolf/rate-distortion) is a key research challenge. Success would yield practical benefits (improved compression) and important theoretical insights into neural representations and distributed coding, strongly aligning with the workshop's goals and having substantial potential impact."
