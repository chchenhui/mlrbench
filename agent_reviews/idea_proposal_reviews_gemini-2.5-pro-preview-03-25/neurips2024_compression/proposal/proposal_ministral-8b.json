    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-aligned with the task description (ML+Compression, information theory, distributed settings, theoretical limits), the research idea (MI-regularized VAEs for distributed compression), and the literature review (builds on neural distributed coding, MI regularization concepts). It directly addresses the core problem outlined in the idea and fits squarely within the workshop's topics of interest, particularly focusing on theoretical understanding and improvements in learning-based data compression in distributed settings. Minor point: while it touches upon distributed settings relevant to large models (federated learning), the primary focus is data compression rather than model compression or direct acceleration of large foundation models, but this is still a core topic for the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The objectives, overall methodology (VAE structure, MI regularization concept), experimental plan (datasets, baselines, metrics), and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. However, crucial details regarding the practical implementation are missing. Specifically, it doesn't explain *how* the mutual information term MI(z1, z2) will be estimated or maximized within the deep learning framework (e.g., using variational bounds, MINE, etc.), which is critical for reproducibility and assessing soundness. Additionally, the plan for the theoretical analysis (comparing bounds to Slepian-Wolf) lacks specifics on the methodology to be used. The definition of the 'Neural Compression' baseline could also be more precise."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While VAEs, distributed compression, and MI regularization are known concepts (as shown in the literature review), the specific combination of using VAEs for encoding distributed continuous sources and explicitly regularizing the training objective by maximizing mutual information between their latent codes appears relatively novel in the context of distributed *source coding*. It differs from prior work focusing primarily on side-information at the decoder, VQ-VAE approaches, or MI for representation learning/channel coding. The aim to connect this empirically driven approach with theoretical Slepian-Wolf limits also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is conceptually sound, based on established VAE principles and the information-theoretic motivation of using MI to capture correlation. The mathematical formulations provided (encoder/decoder, MI definition, basic loss structure) are correct. However, the soundness is weakened by the lack of detail on the MI estimation/maximization technique. Estimating MI between continuous latent variables is non-trivial and often involves approximations or specific estimators, the choice of which significantly impacts results and rigor. Without specifying this, the methodological soundness is questionable. Furthermore, the claim of deriving rate-distortion bounds comparable to Slepian-Wolf limits for complex neural networks is ambitious and lacks a clear methodological pathway, potentially overstating the theoretical rigor achievable."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The experimental part of the proposal is largely feasible. Training VAEs, implementing MI estimators (though challenging to tune), using specified datasets (multi-view images, sensor data), and comparing against baselines are achievable with standard ML resources. However, the feasibility of the theoretical analysis objective (deriving bounds and comparing rigorously to Slepian-Wolf) is questionable given the complexity of analyzing deep neural networks; this part seems significantly more challenging than presented. The practical success also hinges on effectively implementing and tuning the MI estimation/maximization component, which can be complex."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research addresses a significant and relevant problem: efficient compression of correlated data in distributed settings, which is crucial for applications like IoT, sensor networks, and federated learning. Bridging the gap between powerful neural compression methods and information-theoretic principles for distributed scenarios is an important research direction. If successful, the work could lead to improved compression techniques and provide valuable theoretical insights, potentially impacting efficiency in various distributed systems as outlined (IoT, FL, low-bandwidth communication)."
