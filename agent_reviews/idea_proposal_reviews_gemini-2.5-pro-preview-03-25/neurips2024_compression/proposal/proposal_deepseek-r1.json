        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on ML for compression, information theory, distributed settings, and theoretical understanding. The core idea of using MI regularization for neural distributed compression perfectly matches the provided research idea. The methodology builds upon concepts discussed in the literature review (VAEs, MI estimation, neural distributed coding) while proposing a specific novel approach. It explicitly aims to bridge the gap between neural methods and information-theoretic limits (Slepian-Wolf), a key theme in the task description and literature review challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section outlines the algorithmic framework, loss function, MI estimation technique, theoretical analysis approach, and experimental design in a structured manner. The language is precise and technical. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as a more explicit explanation of how maximizing MI between latent codes aids compression in the distributed setting (beyond just capturing correlation) and a clearer link between the general Information Bottleneck principle cited and the specific loss function proposed. The mention of a figure (Fig. 1) that isn't included slightly detracts from full clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While neural distributed compression and the use of mutual information in ML/compression exist (as shown in the literature review), the specific approach of using explicit MI maximization *between the latent codes* of distributed VAE-based encoders as a regularizer for the *source coding* task appears novel. It differs from prior work focusing on VQ-VAE, attention mechanisms for side information, or MI for channel coding/representation learning. The proposed theoretical analysis connecting this specific MI regularization strategy to rate-distortion bounds and Slepian-Wolf limits also represents a novel contribution."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (VAEs, information theory, MI estimation using InfoNCE). The proposed methodology, combining reconstruction loss with MI regularization, is plausible for leveraging source correlations. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant datasets, strong baselines from the literature, appropriate metrics, and ablation studies. The plan for theoretical analysis is relevant, although proving the connection to Slepian-Wolf limits for complex neural models might be challenging and require careful assumptions. A minor point is the potential tension between maximizing MI and minimizing individual rates, which isn't explicitly discussed but is implicitly handled by the trade-off parameter lambda."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required datasets are available or generatable. The core methods (VAEs, CNNs/LSTMs, InfoNCE) are standard deep learning techniques with readily available software libraries. The computational resources mentioned (A100 GPUs) are appropriate for this scale of research. The experimental plan is detailed and implementable. Potential challenges include the practical optimization of the combined loss function (tuning lambda, critic network stability) and the complexity of the theoretical derivations, but these represent standard research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical problem of efficient distributed compression for correlated data, which is increasingly relevant in areas like IoT, federated learning, and multi-sensor systems, all mentioned as key applications. Successfully bridging the gap between high-performing neural methods and information-theoretic guarantees (like Slepian-Wolf) would be a major advancement. The expected outcomes (improved rate-distortion, theoretical bounds) could lead to substantial practical benefits (reduced bandwidth, energy savings) and contribute valuable theoretical insights to the fields of machine learning, compression, and information theory, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
