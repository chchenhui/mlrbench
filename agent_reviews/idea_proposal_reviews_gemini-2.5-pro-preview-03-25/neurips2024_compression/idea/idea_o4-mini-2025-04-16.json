        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics of the workshop: 1) 'Improvements in learning-based techniques for compressing... implicit/learned representations of signals' (NeRF compression), 2) 'Integrating information-theoretic principles to improve learning and generalization' (using Information Bottleneck), and 3) 'Theoretical understanding of neural compression methods' (deriving rate-distortion bounds). The goal of creating efficient NeRFs fits the workshop's aim of developing 'scalable, efficient information-processing systems'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (NeRF size/computation cost), the core technique (Information Bottleneck integrated into training via a specific variational term), the subsequent steps (pruning via Fisher information, learned quantization, entropy coding), the theoretical component (rate-distortion bounds), and the expected outcome (quantitative compression and quality metrics). The components are logically connected and easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While NeRF compression itself is an active research area, and the Information Bottleneck principle is known in representation learning and general model compression, its specific application to guide NeRF compression during training, combined with Fisher-based pruning and learned quantization, offers a fresh perspective. Deriving specific rate-distortion bounds for this IB-NeRF framework adds to the originality. It's a novel combination and application of existing principles to a relevant problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. Implementing variational Information Bottleneck objectives is achievable with existing techniques, although it might add complexity to the NeRF training pipeline. Estimating Fisher information for pruning is standard. Learned quantization and entropy coding are established methods. Training NeRFs requires significant compute, but the proposed modifications seem manageable within typical ML research environments. The theoretical derivation of bounds is standard research practice. No fundamental roadblocks are apparent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. NeRFs represent a major advance in view synthesis, but their practical deployment is hindered by model size and computational cost. Developing principled compression methods like IB-NeRF, especially those offering theoretical guarantees alongside empirical performance (targeting 5x compression with minimal quality loss), directly addresses this key limitation. Success would significantly benefit applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation, making NeRF technology more accessible."
