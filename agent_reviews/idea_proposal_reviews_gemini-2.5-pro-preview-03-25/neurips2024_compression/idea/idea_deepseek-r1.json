        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed: 'learning-based techniques for compressing data', 'distributed compression', 'theoretical understanding of neural compression methods', 'fundamental information-theoretic limits', 'compression without quantization', and 'integrating information-theoretic principles'. The focus on distributed compression using neural networks regularized by mutual information fits squarely within the intersection of machine learning, compression, and information theory that the workshop aims to foster."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (limitations of classical DSC, potential of neural methods), the core proposal (MI-regularized VAE framework for distributed sources), the objectives (maximize MI between latents, minimize reconstruction error, theoretical analysis, experimental validation), and the potential impact are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The mechanism of using MI regularization as a proxy for exploiting correlation in a distributed setting is clearly explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While neural compression and VAEs are established, and MI regularization is used in representation learning, applying this specific combination (MI-regularized VAEs) explicitly for *distributed* source coding of correlated *continuous* sources, and aiming to connect it theoretically to rate-distortion bounds and Slepian-Wolf limits, offers a fresh perspective. It combines existing concepts (neural compression, information theory, distributed coding) in a novel way to address a specific challenge in distributed systems. It's not a completely new paradigm but a significant and innovative extension/combination within the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Training VAEs is standard practice. Estimating and optimizing mutual information between latent variables of separate networks is achievable using established techniques (e.g., MINE, InfoNCE variants), although it can present optimization challenges. Acquiring or simulating correlated data sources (multi-view images, sensor data) is practical. The experimental validation against baselines is straightforward. The theoretical analysis connecting MI regularization strength to rate-distortion bounds might be challenging, especially achieving tight bounds comparable to Slepian-Wolf for complex neural models, but deriving some theoretical insights or bounds seems plausible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Distributed compression is a fundamental problem with growing relevance in areas like IoT, federated learning, and sensor networks. Classical methods often struggle with the complex, high-dimensional correlations that neural networks can potentially model effectively. Developing theoretically grounded neural methods for distributed compression could lead to substantial improvements in efficiency for these applications. Bridging the gap between information theory (Slepian-Wolf) and modern neural techniques for this problem is an important research direction."
