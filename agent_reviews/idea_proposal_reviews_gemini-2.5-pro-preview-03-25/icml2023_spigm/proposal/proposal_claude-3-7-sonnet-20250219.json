        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on uncertainty quantification in structured data (graphs) and applications in science. It perfectly elaborates on the research idea of integrating Bayesian principles into GNN message passing. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles key challenges identified in the literature review, such as integrating UQ into the architecture (rather than post-hoc), distinguishing uncertainty types, and the need for empirical validation across diverse applications. The proposed work fits squarely within the scope of the workshop described in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the research objectives. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the proposed UAMP-Nets, including mathematical formulations for Bayesian parameters, message passing, attention, and the loss function. The experimental design is thorough, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and evaluation strategies. Expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. While some finer implementation details (e.g., exact UPDATE function structure) are omitted, this is appropriate for a proposal, and the overall presentation is highly understandable and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Bayesian GNNs and UQ for GNNs exist (as shown in the literature review), the core idea of integrating uncertainty propagation *directly* into the message-passing mechanism by maintaining and transforming distributions (mean and variance) throughout the graph layers is a significant step beyond typical post-hoc methods or standard ensembles. The proposed uncertainty-aware attention mechanism, which explicitly incorporates uncertainty estimates (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^2) into attention weight calculation, is also a novel contribution. The explicit aim to separate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty *within* this propagation framework adds to the novelty. It clearly distinguishes itself from surveyed methods like conformal prediction, SDEs, or simple ensembles."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon solid theoretical foundations in Bayesian inference, variational inference, and GNNs. The methodology uses established techniques like representing features/parameters as distributions and employing the ELBO objective. The mathematical formulations for distribution propagation (mean and variance aggregation) appear correct under standard assumptions (like neighbor independence conditional on the previous layer, often used in GNNs). The use of a diagonal covariance matrix is a practical approximation. Adding a calibration term to the loss is sensible. Minor weaknesses include the need for further justification of the independence assumption and more detail on how aleatoric vs. epistemic variance components are specifically parameterized and learned during propagation. Overall, the approach is technically well-grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Implementing variational inference for distribution propagation in GNNs is complex and computationally intensive, requiring significant expertise and resources (acknowledged by mentioning A100 GPUs). Training may be slow, and convergence can be difficult to achieve. Scalability to very large graphs could be a concern. The experimental plan is ambitious, requiring careful implementation of multiple baselines and metrics across diverse datasets. However, the proposed methods use existing frameworks (PyTorch Geometric) and techniques (VI, Bayesian DL), making it achievable with the right resources and expertise. The risks (computation, tuning, effectiveness of uncertainty separation) are manageable research challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of reliable uncertainty quantification in GNNs, which hinders their adoption in high-stakes domains. Developing GNNs that provide trustworthy confidence estimates would be a major advancement. The potential impact is substantial, enabling more informed decision-making in areas like drug discovery, traffic management, and financial modeling. The ability to distinguish uncertainty sources offers deeper insights. Success would represent a significant methodological contribution to graph representation learning and trustworthy AI, with broad applicability."
