    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The workshop focuses on probabilistic methods for structured data, including graphs, scaling, uncertainty quantification, and applications. The idea directly targets uncertainty quantification using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are methods for graph-structured data. It explicitly mentions scalability and applications, aligning perfectly with the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It outlines the motivation, the core components of the proposed 'Uncertainty-GNN' (Encoder, Uncertainty Layer, Propagation Mechanism), the methodology, and expected outcomes. However, the specific nature of the 'Uncertainty Layer' and the 'Uncertainty Propagation' mechanism lacks detail. For instance, it doesn't specify whether it uses Bayesian methods, ensembles, dropout, evidential learning, or a novel technique for uncertainty estimation and propagation. This lack of technical specificity introduces minor ambiguities."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Uncertainty quantification in GNNs is an active research area with existing approaches like Bayesian GNNs, MC-Dropout for GNNs, and GNN ensembles. The proposal combines known components (GNN encoder, UQ layer, propagation) into a framework. The novelty likely resides in the specific design or integration of the 'Uncertainty Layer' and 'Propagation Mechanism'. Without more technical detail, it's difficult to assess if it's a groundbreaking approach or a novel combination/refinement of existing techniques. It builds upon existing work but doesn't appear radically different on the surface."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. GNNs are well-established, and various techniques for uncertainty quantification exist and can be adapted. Standard graph datasets are available for experimentation. Potential challenges include the computational cost of applying UQ methods to large-scale graphs (a challenge the proposal aims to address) and potentially the need for specific datasets with ground-truth uncertainty or sophisticated simulation setups for evaluation. However, these are common research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Uncertainty quantification is crucial for building reliable and trustworthy AI systems, especially when dealing with complex graph data prevalent in many real-world applications (social networks, biology, recommendations). Improving UQ for GNNs, particularly regarding scalability and interpretability, would be a valuable contribution to the field and enable more robust applications."
