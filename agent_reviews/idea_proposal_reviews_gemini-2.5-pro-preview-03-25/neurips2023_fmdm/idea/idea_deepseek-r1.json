        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses one of the core challenges highlighted: 'Foundation models are trained on data without actions. How to overcome this limitation from both the dataset and modeling perspectives?'. The proposed 'Action-Aware Pretraining' framework tackles this 'action gap' head-on by suggesting specific methods (multi-modal datasets with actions, self-supervised objectives) and data sources (simulators, RL benchmarks). It also aligns well with listed topics such as 'Applying foundation models to traditional decision making problems in control, planning, online / offline RL', 'Learning multi-modal, multi-task, multi-environment, and generalist policies', and 'New evaluation protocols, benchmarks, datasets, and applications'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (action gap in FMs), the main proposal (action-aware pretraining using multi-modal data and self-supervised objectives like masked action prediction), and the expected outcomes (improved sample efficiency, generalizable policies for decision-making) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. Mentioning potential data sources and the downstream fine-tuning process further enhances clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality and innovation. While research exists on integrating actions into models (e.g., Decision Transformer, behavioral cloning on large datasets), this proposal focuses specifically on creating *general-purpose foundation models* pretrained for *action-awareness* using self-supervised techniques on diverse observation-action data. Framing this as a foundational pretraining step to bridge the 'action gap' for broad downstream decision-making tasks, rather than just task-specific imitation learning, offers a fresh and valuable perspective within the context of scaling up decision-making models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Self-supervised learning objectives (masked prediction, contrastive learning) are well-established. The use of simulators and existing RL datasets (like D4RL) for augmenting data is a practical approach to mitigate the challenge of collecting large-scale real-world action-paired data. Training foundation models requires significant computational resources, which is a standard challenge in the field but does not render the idea infeasible. Fine-tuning with RL is also a standard technique. The primary challenge lies in curating sufficiently diverse and large-scale action-observation datasets, but the proposed mitigation strategies make it achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the 'action gap' is crucial for unlocking the potential of foundation models in sequential decision-making domains like robotics and autonomous systems. Successfully pretraining FMs to understand actions and dynamics could lead to major advancements in sample efficiency and generalization for RL and control agents, which are currently significant bottlenecks. This research could enable faster adaptation to new tasks and environments, paving the way for more capable and versatile intelligent agents."
