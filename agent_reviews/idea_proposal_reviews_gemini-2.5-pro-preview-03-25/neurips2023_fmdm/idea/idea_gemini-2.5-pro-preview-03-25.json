        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses a core question explicitly raised in the task description: 'Foundation models are trained on data without actions. How to overcome this limitation from both the dataset and modeling perspectives?'. It proposes a specific modeling approach (inverse dynamics prediction) to incorporate action understanding into foundation models using existing large-scale video datasets, aligning perfectly with the task's focus on bridging foundation models and sequential decision making. It also fits well with the listed topics, such as applying foundation models to control/planning and learning generalist policies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (lack of action grounding in FMs), the core mechanism (using inverse dynamics on video to infer actions for pretraining), the target models (VLMs), potential datasets, and the expected outcome (improved downstream decision-making performance) are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the inverse dynamics model (e.g., its architecture, training process - separate vs. joint, action representation), but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While inverse dynamics models and pretraining on video data are established concepts, the specific proposal to use inferred actions from an inverse dynamics model as a supervisory signal for pretraining large-scale foundation models (VLMs) specifically to imbue them with action-awareness for downstream decision-making tasks is a fresh perspective. It's a novel combination and application of existing techniques to address a well-defined gap in current FM pretraining strategies."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Large-scale video datasets exist, and foundation model pretraining pipelines are established. The main challenge lies in developing and scaling an inverse dynamics model that can reliably infer meaningful actions from diverse, unlabeled video data (e.g., Ego4D). The quality and ambiguity of inferred actions could be a bottleneck, potentially requiring significant engineering or methodological innovation for the IDM component. However, the overall approach uses existing types of data and models, making it plausible to implement, albeit with potential challenges in the IDM's effectiveness."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Addressing the lack of action grounding in foundation models is a critical step towards making them truly useful for robotics, embodied AI, and other decision-making domains, as highlighted in the task description. If successful, this pretraining approach could significantly reduce the need for task-specific fine-tuning, improve sample efficiency, and enhance the generalization capabilities of FMs in interactive settings, representing a major advancement in the field."
