        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of integrating Foundation Models (specifically VLMs) with Sequential Decision Making (RL, planning). It tackles key challenges mentioned in the task, such as enabling FMs to perform long-term planning, structuring environments for FM integration ('reward subgoal achievement'), and potentially overcoming the lack of action data in FM pretraining by using the VLM for high-level planning rather than direct action generation. The proposed hierarchical approach fits squarely within the specified topics like 'applying foundation models to traditional decision making problems in control, planning, online / offline RL' and 'long-horizon reasoning and planning in language models'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (hierarchical VLM planner + RL executor), and expected outcomes are well-defined. The mechanism of using model-based RL to fine-tune the VLM planner based on subgoal feedback is understandable. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific model-based RL algorithm envisioned for fine-tuning the VLM or the exact nature of the symbolic plans/subgoals, but the overall research direction is clearly presented and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using FMs for planning and hierarchical RL are existing concepts, the specific proposal to use a VLM as a high-level planner fine-tuned via *model-based* RL is innovative. This leverages the VLM's potential world modeling capabilities to predict outcomes and refine plans, going beyond simpler zero-shot planning or fine-tuning via imitation/model-free RL. It offers a fresh perspective on integrating the reasoning capabilities of VLMs with the control learning of RL by focusing on refining the planning process itself through simulated or predicted experience."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. VLMs, hierarchical RL frameworks, and model-based RL algorithms are available. However, effectively fine-tuning a large VLM using model-based RL requires significant computational resources and careful algorithmic design to ensure stability and sample efficiency. Designing tasks and environments with appropriate structure (clear subgoals, multimodal inputs) that facilitate both VLM planning and low-level RL execution is crucial and non-trivial. Integrating the components and managing the data flow also requires careful engineering."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses fundamental limitations of both VLMs (lack of robust sequential decision-making capabilities) and traditional RL (poor generalization and sample efficiency). Successfully integrating VLM's broad knowledge and reasoning with RL's control capabilities in a hierarchical manner could lead to major advancements in creating adaptable, sample-efficient agents for complex, long-horizon tasks in domains like robotics and healthcare, as highlighted in the motivation. It directly contributes to the goal of developing more capable foundation models for decision making."
