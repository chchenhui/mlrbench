    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses several key themes mentioned, including foundation models for decision making, learning from human feedback (specifically mentioning RLHF), long-horizon reasoning, multi-modal interaction, and the need for new evaluation protocols and benchmarks. The focus on human-AI interaction aligns perfectly with the task's emphasis on agents interacting with humans and the challenges faced by foundation models in real-world applications."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the main goal (hybrid RLHF + FM approach) is stated. The four proposed components (Human Feedback Integration, Long-Horizon Reasoning, Multi-Modal Interaction, Evaluation) provide a good structure. However, the descriptions within each component are somewhat high-level (e.g., 'Develop algorithms', 'Implement techniques'), lacking specific details on the proposed methodologies or technical approaches. Minor refinements specifying potential techniques would enhance precision."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Combining foundation models with RLHF for decision-making is a current and active research area, as acknowledged in the task description itself. Applying this to enhance human-AI interaction, integrating long-horizon reasoning and multi-modality specifically for this purpose, and developing tailored benchmarks offers a valuable synthesis. However, the individual components (RLHF, long-horizon reasoning for FMs, multi-modal FMs) are known research directions rather than entirely groundbreaking concepts. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and application focus than in fundamentally new techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It builds upon existing foundation models, RLHF frameworks, and ongoing research into long-horizon reasoning and multi-modality. However, significant challenges exist: integrating human feedback effectively and in real-time with large FMs, achieving robust long-horizon planning within these models, developing seamless multi-modal interaction, and creating comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are non-trivial tasks requiring substantial research and engineering effort, as well as significant computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Improving human-AI interaction in sequential decision-making is critical for the safe, effective, and trustworthy deployment of AI in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous driving, and robotics. Addressing current limitations in adaptability, reasoning, and communication for foundation models in these interactive settings could lead to major advancements and more capable AI assistants."
