        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the task description: the 'actions gap' in foundation models trained without action data. The proposed Sim2Act framework aligns perfectly with the research idea, which focuses on using simulation for self-supervised action data generation. Furthermore, the proposal incorporates concepts and addresses challenges (e.g., sim-to-real, multi-modal integration, sample efficiency, long-horizon planning) identified in the provided literature review, showing a deep understanding of the context and prior work. It comprehensively tackles the need for new datasets and modeling approaches for foundation models in decision-making."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and outlines the proposed solution (Sim2Act). The methodology section is logically structured, breaking down the framework into understandable components (environments, exploration, data collection, model, bootstrapping). The objectives, model architecture, loss functions, and experimental design are articulated concisely and with minimal ambiguity. The rationale behind the approach and the expected outcomes are clearly presented. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the proposal immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using simulation for data generation in RL is common, the specific approach of Sim2Act – leveraging base foundation models for language-conditioned exploration to generate data for training another action-aware foundation model via self-supervision (contrastive learning + BC + dynamics) and iterative bootstrapping – represents a novel combination of existing techniques applied specifically to bridge the 'actions gap' in large pre-trained models. It offers a fresh perspective compared to directly using FMs as priors in standard RL or relying solely on imitation learning. The novelty lies in the integrated framework for self-supervised action data generation tailored for FMs."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in foundation models, sequential decision-making, self-supervised learning, and simulation. The methodology is logical, employing established techniques like behavior cloning, contrastive learning, and dynamics modeling within a coherent framework. The use of diverse simulators and data filtering strategies is well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes relevant ablation studies and generalization tests. Technical formulations for losses are standard. Minor gaps exist in specifying the exact architecture details or hyperparameter choices, but the overall approach is robust and well-justified based on current literature."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial computational resources for training large models and running extensive simulations across diverse environments. Integrating multiple simulators with a standardized API and implementing the complex pipeline (FM-guided exploration, filtering, multi-modal training, bootstrapping) demands considerable engineering effort. Key risks include the effectiveness of the FM-guided exploration for complex tasks and the persistent challenge of sim-to-real transfer, which is addressed in the evaluation but not fully solved by the core method. While technically achievable with current technology and sufficient resources, the project is ambitious and carries moderate execution risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck – the lack of action understanding in foundation models – which currently limits their application in robotics, autonomous systems, and other interactive domains. Successfully bridging this 'actions gap' could unlock the potential of FMs for complex decision-making tasks, leading to major advancements in sample efficiency and generalization. The potential contributions, including action-aware FMs, large-scale datasets, and methodological innovations in self-supervised learning for action, are substantial and clearly articulated. The research has broad implications across multiple AI application areas."
