    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the task description: the lack of action data in foundation models ('actions gap'). The research idea of using simulation for self-supervised action data generation (Sim2Act) is clearly reflected and elaborated upon. The methodology incorporates concepts and addresses challenges (sim-to-real, multi-modal learning, sample efficiency) discussed in the provided literature review (e.g., Yang et al., Ye et al., Johnson & Lee, White & Brown) and the task description's call for new datasets and methods to apply FMs to decision making."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology is broken down into logical steps (Data Generation, Model Architecture, Training, Iterative Improvement, Experiments, Sim-to-Real). Key components like model architecture, loss functions, and experimental setup are described. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for 'foundation model-guided exploration' beyond zero-shot prompting and the specific learning process for action embeddings (z_a) in the contrastive loss, but these do not significantly obscure the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing existing concepts in a novel framework (Sim2Act). While components like using FMs for decision-making guidance (Ye et al.), simulation for data generation (White & Brown), contrastive learning (Doe & Smith, Blue & Red), and iterative improvement are known, their integration into a self-supervised pipeline specifically for generating large-scale vision-language-action data via FM-guided exploration to train multi-modal policies is a fresh approach. It's distinct from prior work focusing on online RL guidance or requiring expert demonstrations. The novelty lies in the specific combination and application to bridge the FM action gap."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established methods (FMs, simulation, contrastive learning, BC, domain randomization). The methodology is mostly rigorous, outlining standard architectures and loss functions. However, some aspects could benefit from further justification: the quality and diversity of data generated purely by zero-shot FM exploration might be limited initially, the mechanism for learning action embeddings (z_a) isn't detailed, and the stability/convergence of the iterative improvement loop isn't deeply analyzed. The sim-to-real plan relies on standard but challenging techniques. Technical formulations presented (losses) are correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. It requires significant computational resources (FM access, large-scale simulation, training), diverse simulation environments, and access to robotic hardware (UR5, Spot) for validation. These requirements are typical for state-of-the-art robotics/FM research but represent a high bar. The core techniques are available, but integration and scaling present challenges. Sim-to-real transfer remains a significant hurdle with inherent risks, although standard mitigation strategies are proposed. The scope (1M+ samples, 100+ tasks, real-world validation) is substantial."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: enabling foundation models to perform sequential decision-making tasks by overcoming the lack of action data in their pretraining. This is a critical bottleneck identified in the task description and literature. Success would have a major impact by potentially enabling more sample-efficient training of generalist embodied agents, reducing reliance on costly real-world data collection, advancing multi-modal AI, and providing valuable datasets and benchmarks for the community. The potential contributions to science and industry are substantial."
