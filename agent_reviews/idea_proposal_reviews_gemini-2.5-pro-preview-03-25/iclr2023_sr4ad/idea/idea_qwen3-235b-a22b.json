        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of 'integration strategies and intermediate representations' by proposing a unified hierarchical spatiotemporal graph. It explicitly targets 'Representation learning for perception, prediction', 'Approaches that account for interactions between traditional sub-components (e.g., joint perception and prediction)', and aims to improve 'generalization' and 'safety' through specific ML techniques (self-supervised learning, interaction modeling). The focus on a unified scene representation for autonomous driving fits perfectly within the scope of the invited contributions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (hierarchical spatiotemporal graph), key components (GNNs, TCNs, self-supervised learning, data fusion), and objectives (joint optimization, improved accuracy/generalization/safety) are well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architecture details (e.g., precise graph construction, adaptive edge mechanism), but the overall concept and approach are understandable and precisely described for a research idea summary."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While spatiotemporal graphs and GNNs are used in autonomous driving research, the proposed combination of a *hierarchical* structure, *unified* representation of static and dynamic elements with *adaptive* interaction edges, *joint* optimization of detection, scene flow, and prediction using dynamic GNNs/TCNs, and integration of *self-supervised contrastive learning* offers a fresh perspective and a novel synthesis of existing concepts. It extends beyond typical approaches by aiming for a more comprehensive and integrated scene understanding framework."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. The core components (GNNs, TCNs, sensor fusion, self-supervised learning) are based on existing technologies. However, constructing, managing, and training a complex, dynamic, hierarchical graph representing large-scale, real-time driving scenes will be computationally intensive and require significant engineering effort. Ensuring real-time performance for deployment is a major hurdle. Data integration and defining the adaptive edge mechanisms effectively also pose challenges. It's feasible as a research project but requires considerable resources and careful design for practical implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical problem of fragmented systems and error propagation in autonomous driving perception and prediction. A successful unified representation could lead to major advancements in scene understanding, interaction modeling, and prediction accuracy, particularly in complex urban environments. Improving generalization, robustness to edge cases, and potentially enabling safer planning through explicit interaction modeling would be major contributions. Reducing reliance on labeled data via self-supervised learning adds further value. The potential impact on the field, including advancing end-to-end driving systems, is substantial."
