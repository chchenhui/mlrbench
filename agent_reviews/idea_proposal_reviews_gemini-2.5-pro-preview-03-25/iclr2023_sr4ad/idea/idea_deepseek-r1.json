        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop call for papers). It directly addresses multiple key topics mentioned: 'Representation learning for perception, prediction', 'Approaches that account for interactions between traditional sub-components (e.g., joint perception and prediction)', and 'ML / statistical learning approaches to facilitate safety / interpretability'. It also implicitly touches upon benchmarking ('nuScenes' dataset) and offers a 'New perspective' on integrating AD components. The focus on unified representations and interpretability fits the workshop theme exceptionally well."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main technical approach (transformer-based joint model), key innovations (multi-task attention, explainability layers, contrastive learning), evaluation plan (dataset, metrics), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. Minor details about the specific architectural nuances or the exact implementation of explainability methods could be further specified, but the core concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While joint perception and prediction, transformer architectures, and interpretability methods are individually active research areas, the proposed combination is innovative. Specifically, integrating multi-task attention, dedicated explainability layers (including uncertainty), and contrastive learning for driving semantics within a unified transformer framework for joint perception and prediction offers a fresh perspective. It builds upon existing trends but proposes a specific, coherent integration strategy with a strong focus on interpretability, differentiating it from standard approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Transformer models, multi-modal fusion, joint task learning, attention mechanisms, uncertainty estimation, and contrastive learning are established techniques in ML. Datasets like nuScenes are readily available. Implementation would require significant engineering effort and computational resources (typical for state-of-the-art AD research), and conducting rigorous user studies for interpretability presents practical challenges, but there are no fundamental roadblocks suggesting impossibility. The components are known and implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in current autonomous driving systems: the inefficiency, potential for error propagation, and lack of transparency associated with separate perception and prediction modules. Developing a unified, interpretable representation could lead to major advancements in prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, system robustness, and trustworthiness. Enhancing interpretability is crucial for safety validation, debugging, and public/regulatory acceptance, making this research direction highly relevant and potentially transformative for the field."
