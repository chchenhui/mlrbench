        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core task of developing unified scene representations for autonomous driving, integrating perception, prediction, and planning aspects as requested. The research idea is clearly translated into specific objectives and methodologies. The proposal effectively positions itself within the context of the provided literature, citing relevant works (UniScene, VAD, HDGT, Trajectron++) and aiming to address identified challenges like integrating static/dynamic elements and improving generalization. All key requirements are comprehensively covered."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology section provides a good overview of the data, graph construction, network architecture, and experimental design. Technical formulations for node features, edge weights, and GAT updates are included. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, particularly regarding the specific implementation details of the 'hierarchical' aspect of the graph and the precise mechanism for integrating 'planning' beyond perception and prediction, which prevents a perfect score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While leveraging existing concepts like graph neural networks (GATs), temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), and contrastive learning, its novelty lies in the specific combination and application: a *hierarchical* spatiotemporal graph designed to *unify* static infrastructure and dynamic actors for joint perception-prediction-planning in autonomous driving. This approach, particularly the hierarchical structure combined with TCNs for temporal modeling and contrastive learning for generalization in this unified context, offers a fresh perspective compared to the cited literature (e.g., HDGT's heterogeneous graph, Trajectron++'s RNN structure, UniScene's occupancy focus). The distinction from prior work is clear."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established methods (GAT, TCN, Contrastive Learning). The rationale for choosing these components is reasonable (GAT for spatial attention, TCN for temporal dependencies). The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, metrics, and baselines. However, the soundness score is slightly lowered because the 'hierarchical' nature of the HSTG, a key component of the proposed novelty, is not sufficiently detailed in the methodology section to fully assess its rigor and effectiveness. Additionally, the integration of the planning component needs more technical elaboration, and the claim about efficiency gains via 'hierarchical graph sparsification' lacks specific details."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard, publicly available datasets (NuScenes, Argoverse 2, KITTI) and well-established machine learning techniques and libraries (PyTorch Geometric). The required steps like sensor fusion and preprocessing are common practice. The main challenges lie in the implementation complexity of integrating the hierarchical graph structure with GATs, TCNs, and contrastive learning, and potentially the significant computational resources needed for training on large-scale datasets. However, these challenges are typical for state-of-the-art AD research and seem manageable within a well-resourced research environment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in autonomous driving: the need for unified scene representations to overcome the limitations of modular pipelines and improve safety and robustness in complex environments. Successfully unifying static and dynamic elements, integrating multimodal data, and enabling joint perception-prediction-planning within a single framework could lead to major advancements. The potential impacts—improved accuracy, better generalization (especially via contrastive learning), enhanced safety through explicit interaction modeling, and potentially improved efficiency—are substantial and clearly articulated. This research has strong potential to contribute meaningfully to the field."
