        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for unified representations, integration of perception/prediction, and methods enhancing generalization. The proposed Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph (HSTG) directly implements the core research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon relevant works cited in the literature review (VAD, UniScene, HDGT, Trajectron++, Social-STGCNN), positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape and aiming to tackle identified challenges like static/dynamic integration and generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, and the methodology follows a logical structure, explaining data processing, graph construction (including layers and edge definitions with formulas), the learning process (DGNN stages, contrastive loss), and experimental setup. The use of technical terms is appropriate. Minor ambiguities exist: the mechanism for 'hierarchical graph sparsification' mentioned for efficiency isn't detailed in the methodology, and the extent to which 'planning' is integrated into the joint optimization (beyond being aided by the representation) could be slightly more explicit. Overall, however, the core concepts and plan are understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While graph-based representations, GNNs, TCNs, and contrastive learning are existing techniques, the specific contribution lies in their synthesis: proposing a *hierarchical* spatiotemporal graph that explicitly integrates static map elements and dynamic agents, using adaptive attention and temporal convolutions within this unified structure, and employing scene graph contrastive learning for joint perception-prediction generalization. This combination offers a distinct approach compared to cited works like VAD (vectorized), UniScene (occupancy), and HDGT (heterogeneous graph primarily for prediction), representing a novel architecture and learning strategy for unified scene understanding in autonomous driving."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, based on established ML principles like GNNs (GATv2), TCNs, attention, and contrastive learning. The mathematical formulations provided for edge weights, graph updates, and the loss function are standard and appear correct. The experimental design uses appropriate datasets, metrics, and baselines. However, a key aspect mentioned in the Significance section ('hierarchical graph sparsification' for efficiency) lacks technical detail in the Methodology, making it difficult to assess the rigor of the scalability solution. Addressing how the graph complexity will be managed in dense scenes is crucial for soundness in practice. Without this detail, the soundness score is slightly reduced."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard datasets (nuScenes, Argoverse 2) and implementable ML techniques. However, constructing and training large-scale hierarchical spatiotemporal graphs, especially with contrastive pretraining, will be computationally intensive, requiring significant GPU resources. Integrating multi-modal sensor data robustly into the graph structure presents engineering challenges. The primary feasibility concern is achieving real-time or near-real-time performance, which hinges on the effectiveness of the unspecified graph sparsification technique. While achievable in a research setting, these computational and implementation hurdles present moderate risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in autonomous driving: the limitations of fragmented perception/prediction systems and the need for robust, generalizable unified representations. By aiming to integrate static and dynamic information, model interactions explicitly, and improve generalization through self-supervision, the research has the potential for major impact. If successful in achieving the anticipated performance gains (e.g., 15-20% ADE reduction) and reducing label dependency, it could lead to more robust, efficient, and safer autonomous systems, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the task description and advancing the field."
