    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of developing practical interactive learning algorithms using PAC-Bayesian theory and analyzing exploration-exploitation trade-offs. The proposal faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology, and expected impact. It effectively incorporates and distinguishes itself from the cited literature, particularly the recent works by Tasdighi et al., by proposing a direct PAC-Bayesian policy optimization objective coupled with uncertainty-aware exploration, rather than focusing solely on Bellman error bounds or critic regularization. It also acknowledges and aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as sample efficiency and non-stationarity (citing Chugg et al. for potential theoretical tools)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to specific objectives, detailed methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. The objectives are stated precisely. The core concepts, including the PAC-Bayesian formulation for RL, the proposed PBPO algorithm structure, the actor-critic integration, and the Thompson sampling exploration strategy, are explained thoroughly and are readily understandable. The inclusion of pseudocode further enhances clarity regarding the proposed algorithm's implementation. Minor theoretical details, like the exact derivation of the RL-specific PAC-Bayes bound, are understandably left for the research itself but the overall approach is unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While PAC-Bayes has been applied to RL before (as evidenced by the literature review), this proposal's core idea – directly optimizing a PAC-Bayesian objective for the policy parameters (actor) and using the resulting posterior uncertainty via Thompson sampling for exploration – represents a distinct and innovative approach compared to recent related work. Tasdighi et al. (2024) focused on bounding Bellman error and used ensemble-based exploration, while Tasdighi et al. (2023) used PAC-Bayes to regularize the critic. This proposal's focus on a unified PAC-Bayesian objective driving both policy learning and exploration offers a fresh perspective. The novelty is clearly articulated in relation to existing literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established PAC-Bayesian principles and standard actor-critic RL frameworks. The proposed methodology, including the objective function balancing empirical performance (via critic) and KL divergence, and the use of the reparameterization trick, is technically appropriate. The choice of Thompson sampling aligns well with the Bayesian perspective. However, the core theoretical contribution – deriving a tight and theoretically justified PAC-Bayesian bound specifically for the expected cumulative reward in the non-i.i.d., policy-dependent RL setting – is acknowledged as a challenge and remains prospective. While the proposal cites relevant work (Chugg et al.) for handling non-i.i.d. data, the successful derivation and analysis of such a bound are crucial for the full theoretical soundness of the approach. The reliance on critic estimates also introduces potential approximation errors inherent in actor-critic methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The algorithmic components (actor-critic architecture, learning Gaussian posteriors for policy weights, Thompson sampling, replay buffers) are implementable using standard deep RL libraries and computational resources. The experimental plan uses standard benchmarks (MuJoCo) and baselines (SAC, PPO), making comparisons straightforward. The primary risks involve the difficulty of the theoretical derivation of the RL PAC-Bayes bound, potential optimization instability related to the PAC-Bayes objective, and the challenge of tuning the PAC-Bayes coefficient β. However, these are typical research risks rather than fundamental roadblocks. The plan appears realistic for a dedicated research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in RL: sample inefficiency. Developing algorithms that learn effectively with fewer environment interactions is critical for real-world applications (robotics, healthcare, etc.). By proposing a principled approach based on PAC-Bayesian theory to guide exploration and optimize policies, the research has the potential for substantial impact. If successful, it could lead to more data-efficient and potentially safer RL algorithms. Furthermore, it contributes meaningfully to the intersection of PAC-Bayesian theory and interactive learning, aligning perfectly with the workshop's themes and potentially fostering theoretical advancements alongside practical algorithm development."
