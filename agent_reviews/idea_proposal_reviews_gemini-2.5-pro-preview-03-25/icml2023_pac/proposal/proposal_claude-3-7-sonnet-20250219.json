    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the 'PAC-Bayes Meets Interactive Learning' workshop, including PAC-Bayesian analysis for RL (an interactive learning setting), sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, handling distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and developing practical algorithms. The proposal faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the PAC-Bayesian framework, uncertainty-aware exploration, and expected outcomes. It also clearly positions itself relative to the cited literature (e.g., PBAC, PAC-Bayes SAC), aiming to build upon them and address the identified key challenges like sample efficiency, exploration, and non-stationarity."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, outlining the motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes logically. The objectives are clearly stated. The core concepts (PAC-Bayes bounds, uncertainty quantification, PBPO algorithm) are generally well-explained. However, there are minor ambiguities: 1) The specific derivation and practical handling of the PAC-Bayesian bound extension for non-stationarity (using Rényi divergence) lack detail. 2) There's a potential inconsistency or lack of clear connection between the uncertainty measure defined using KL divergence between policies (U(s) in Sec 2.3) and the one used for exploration based on Q-value variance (U(s, a) in Sec 2.3/2.4). 3) The mechanism for adapting the prior (Step 4g) is vague ('weighted average') and its theoretical implications aren't discussed. These points require slight refinement for perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing PAC-Bayesian theory and RL concepts, it proposes a novel framework (PBPO) that directly optimizes a policy distribution by minimizing a PAC-Bayes objective, distinct from prior work like PBAC (bound on Bellman error) or PAC-Bayes SAC (bound as critic objective). The proposed uncertainty-guided exploration strategy, based on posterior variance or policy disagreement, integrated within this optimization framework, also appears novel compared to the ε-greedy approach in PBAC. Furthermore, the explicit goal of deriving and incorporating PAC-Bayes bounds tailored for non-stationarity within this deep RL algorithm adds to its novelty. It represents a fresh synthesis and extension of existing ideas."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has some gaps requiring further justification. It rests on solid theoretical foundations (PAC-Bayes, MDPs). The standard PAC-Bayes bound and the variational approximation approach are well-established. However, key aspects lack full rigor: 1) The derivation and practical applicability of the non-stationary bound involving Rényi divergence need substantiation. How are the required state-action distributions estimated or bounded? 2) The theoretical link between the chosen uncertainty measure (Var_Q[Q_\\theta(s,a)]) and the PAC-Bayes bound optimization needs to be stronger; is this exploration strategy theoretically motivated by the bound itself, or more heuristic? 3) The proposed adaptation of the prior (Step 4g) is problematic for standard PAC-Bayes bounds which assume a fixed prior; this needs justification using appropriate theory (e.g., online PAC-Bayes) or clarification. The potential inconsistency in uncertainty measures also slightly weakens soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Implementing variational inference for policy networks (Gaussian posterior), computing KL divergence, sampling policies, and running RL experiments on standard benchmarks are all achievable. Automatic differentiation frameworks support the required gradient calculations. However, challenges exist: 1) Maintaining and sampling from policy distributions can be computationally intensive, potentially limiting scalability or requiring significant resources. 2) The algorithm introduces several hyperparameters (\\lambda, \\beta, \\alpha, prior/posterior parameters) requiring careful tuning. 3) Practically estimating or bounding the Rényi divergence term for the non-stationary bound might be difficult. Overall, it's feasible but computationally demanding and requires careful implementation and tuning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles critical challenges in RL: sample inefficiency and safe/efficient exploration. Improving sample efficiency through a theoretically grounded PAC-Bayesian approach could make deep RL viable for more real-world applications (robotics, healthcare) where data is costly. The focus on uncertainty quantification contributes to safer RL agents. Successfully bridging PAC-Bayesian theory and practical deep RL algorithms would be a substantial contribution to the field, potentially opening new research avenues. Addressing non-stationarity further enhances the practical relevance. The potential impact on both theory and practice of RL is high."
