        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayes for interactive learning (specifically RL), aiming to develop practical algorithms with theoretical grounding for sample efficiency and exploration-exploitation trade-offs. It explicitly incorporates concepts like handling distribution shifts (non-stationarity) using time-uniform bounds (Chugg et al., 2023) and builds upon/differentiates itself from recent PAC-Bayes RL works (PBAC, PAC-Bayesian SAC) mentioned in the literature. The objectives and methodology perfectly reflect the research idea provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology and expected outcomes. The core concepts (PAC-Bayes bound, variational posterior, uncertainty-aware exploration, non-stationarity handling) are explained well. The objectives are distinct (Theoretical, Algorithmic, Empirical). Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of the empirical loss term \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{L}}_{\\\\mathcal{D}_t}(\\\\theta) within the RL context (though implicitly negative return) and the exact theoretical justification for the specific prior update rule, but these do not significantly impede overall understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several recent advancements in a new way. While it builds upon existing PAC-Bayesian theory, time-uniform bounds (Chugg et al.), and prior PAC-Bayes RL work (PBAC, PAC-Bayesian SAC), its novelty lies in: 1) Proposing an end-to-end differentiable policy optimization framework (PBPO) that directly minimizes a time-uniform PAC-Bayes bound objective for the policy itself, rather than focusing primarily on the critic or Bellman error. 2) Explicitly linking posterior variance to an exploration bonus within this bound-minimization framework. 3) Integrating a specific mechanism for handling non-stationarity based on time-uniform analysis and prior updates. It's a novel synthesis and application rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It grounds itself in established PAC-Bayesian theory and leverages appropriate recent theoretical results (time-uniform bounds from Chugg et al.) for the non-i.i.d., adaptive nature of RL data. The use of variational inference, reparameterization trick, and policy gradients are standard and well-justified techniques. The proposed objective function reasonably combines reward maximization, KL complexity, and entropy. The approach to non-stationarity is theoretically motivated. Minor gaps include needing slightly more explicit justification for the specific prior update mechanism's effect on the bound and clarifying the exact empirical loss definition, but the overall technical approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The algorithmic components (neural networks, variational inference, policy gradients) rely on standard, implementable techniques in deep RL. The experimental plan uses standard benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo, RoboSuite) and baselines. While Bayesian methods inherently add computational overhead (sampling weights, estimating variance) compared to non-Bayesian RL, this is expected and manageable with current hardware. Potential challenges include hyperparameter tuning (common in deep RL) and ensuring stability, but these do not render the proposal infeasible. The inclusion of hardware validation (UR5) increases complexity but is presented as a validation step, suggesting the core work can proceed even without it initially."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It tackles critical and persistent challenges in RL: sample inefficiency and the need for safe, guided exploration, particularly relevant for real-world applications like robotics and healthcare where data is costly or mistakes are prohibitive. By integrating the theoretical rigor of PAC-Bayes (offering potential guarantees) with practical deep RL algorithms and explicitly addressing non-stationarity, the work has the potential for major impact. Successful outcomes (improved sample efficiency, robustness, theoretically grounded exploration) would represent a substantial advancement in RL and align perfectly with the goals of making RL more practical and reliable."
