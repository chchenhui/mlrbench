        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses PAC-Bayesian theory in interactive learning settings (continual, active learning). It focuses explicitly on 'PAC-Bayes bounds under distribution shift' and the 'development of practically useful interactive learning algorithms using PAC-Bayesian theory', both listed as key topics for the workshop. It also tackles the issue of sample efficiency, a central theme mentioned in the workshop scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (computational cost of static PAC-Bayes bounds under shift) is explicit. The core concept ('lazily adapted' bounds triggered by shift detection) is clearly articulated. Key methodological components (Bayesian updates/VI, shift detection tests, active learning integration) are specified. The expected outcomes and target application domains are also clear. Minor details on the exact mathematical form of the bounds or specific shift-detection thresholds could be added, but the overall concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While PAC-Bayes, interactive learning, and distribution shift are established areas, the core novelty lies in the proposed 'lazy adaptation' mechanism for PAC-Bayesian bounds. Combining statistical shift detection with computationally cheaper bound updates (using Bayesian posterior updates or VI) specifically to avoid full retraining or overly conservative static bounds is an innovative approach. Integrating this with an active learning strategy based on bound sensitivity to shift further enhances the novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Implementing shift detection and variational inference is standard. However, the theoretical derivation of PAC-Bayesian bounds that are *dynamically and lazily* updated based on detected shifts, while maintaining validity and proving tightness, could be complex. Ensuring that the proposed update mechanism (especially using VI for deep models) is genuinely more computationally efficient than alternatives in practice requires careful implementation and empirical validation. The core concepts rely on existing techniques, making it plausible, but the theoretical integration and practical efficiency gains need demonstration."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a critical bottleneck in applying PAC-Bayesian theory to real-world interactive systems: the computational burden and sample inefficiency under distribution shifts. Developing theoretically sound methods that are also computationally tractable for adaptation is highly valuable for deploying robust learning systems in dynamic environments like robotics and healthcare. Success would represent a meaningful contribution to both PAC-Bayesian theory and practical interactive learning algorithms."
