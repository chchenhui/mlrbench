        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. The task calls for PAC-Bayesian theory applied to interactive learning settings, specifically mentioning topics like PAC-Bayes bounds under distribution shift, analysis of exploration-exploitation, and development of practical algorithms. The idea directly addresses these points by proposing a PAC-Bayesian framework for non-stationary bandits (a core interactive learning problem involving exploration-exploitation) focusing explicitly on distribution shifts and aiming to develop practical algorithms with theoretical guarantees."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem of non-stationarity in bandits and the potential of PAC-Bayes. The main idea is well-defined, specifying the core contributions: a PAC-Bayesian framework for non-stationary bandits, a novel posterior update mechanism, dynamic exploration adjustment, a time-dependent prior, and the goal of adaptive theoretical guarantees and improved regret bounds. The concepts are specific and understandable within the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While PAC-Bayes for bandits and handling non-stationarity are existing research areas, the proposal introduces specific novel elements: a posterior update mechanism considering uncertainty about the *rate* of change, a time-dependent prior adapting to *estimated* non-stationarity, and PAC-Bayesian guarantees that explicitly adapt to the *unknown* degree of non-stationarity. This combination and focus on adaptive guarantees represent a fresh perspective within the intersection of PAC-Bayes and non-stationary bandits."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents notable technical challenges. Deriving PAC-Bayesian bounds, especially adaptive ones for unknown non-stationarity and incorporating the proposed novel mechanisms (posterior update, time-dependent prior), requires significant theoretical effort and expertise. Implementing the 'practical algorithms' might necessitate approximations or careful design to ensure computational tractability. However, the foundational concepts (PAC-Bayes, bandits) are well-understood, making the research direction plausible within the capabilities of skilled researchers in the area, though requiring substantial work."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Non-stationarity is a critical and pervasive challenge in real-world interactive systems. Developing algorithms with principled theoretical guarantees (via PAC-Bayes) that can robustly adapt to unknown environmental changes would be a major advancement. Success could lead to more reliable and sample-efficient learning algorithms for dynamic settings like recommendation systems or autonomous control, representing a meaningful contribution to both theory and practice."
