        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (PAC-Bayes Meets Interactive Learning Workshop). It directly addresses Reinforcement Learning (an interactive learning setting), the exploration-exploitation trade-off, the use of PAC-Bayesian theory for analysis and algorithm development, deep learning methods (DNN policies), sample efficiency, and PAC-Bayes bounds under distribution shift. It explicitly targets several key topics listed in the call for papers, particularly PAC-Bayesian analysis of exploration-exploitation, bounds under distribution shift, and the development of practical interactive learning algorithms using PAC-Bayesian theory."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (sample inefficiency in RL, potential of PAC-Bayes) is clearly stated. The main technical proposal (optimizing a policy distribution by minimizing a PAC-Bayes bound, using posterior variance for exploration) is articulated concisely and understandably. The expected outcomes and potential impact are also clearly outlined. Minor details regarding the exact mathematical formulation of the bound or the adaptation mechanism for non-stationarity are omitted, but this is expected and acceptable for a research idea summary."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While PAC-Bayes has been applied to supervised learning and bandits, its application directly within the optimization loop of deep reinforcement learning, specifically using the bound minimization to drive policy optimization and uncertainty-aware exploration based on posterior variance, represents a fresh approach. Combining PAC-Bayes optimization, variational inference for deep policies, and explicit handling of non-stationarity within a single RL framework offers a significant advancement over standard PAC-Bayesian analysis applied post-hoc or simpler exploration bonuses. It's a novel combination and application of existing theories to tackle a challenging problem in deep RL."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Optimizing PAC-Bayes bounds, especially non-vacuous ones, for high-dimensional deep neural networks is notoriously difficult. Approximating the posterior distribution accurately and efficiently (e.g., via variational inference) adds complexity. Making the PAC-Bayes bound objective tractable and stable for RL training requires careful theoretical formulation and engineering. Adapting bounds effectively for non-stationary transitions in RL is an open research challenge. Guiding exploration based on posterior variance might be computationally expensive. While conceptually sound, successful implementation requires considerable effort, expertise, and potentially further theoretical breakthroughs to overcome computational and optimization hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Sample inefficiency is a major barrier to applying RL in real-world scenarios like robotics, where data collection is expensive or risky. Developing RL algorithms with better sample efficiency and theoretical underpinnings (like PAC-Bayes bounds) is highly important. If successful, this research could lead to more data-efficient and robust deep RL algorithms, potentially providing performance guarantees or 'safety nets' based on the bounds. This would be a meaningful contribution to both theoretical understanding and practical application of RL."
