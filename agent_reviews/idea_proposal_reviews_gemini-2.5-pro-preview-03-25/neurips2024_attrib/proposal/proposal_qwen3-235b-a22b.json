        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Attributing Model Behavior at Scale' by focusing on concept-based interpretability to link behavior to model subcomponents and potentially data influences. The methodology clearly operationalizes the research idea of combining activation clustering and concept attribution. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as dataset dependence (via ablation studies) and concept learnability (via unsupervised discovery and correlation), positioning itself effectively within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific, the methodology is broken down into logical steps with mathematical formulations provided for key parts, and the experimental design is well-defined. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature and sourcing of all 'curated concept datasets' beyond examples, the exact mechanism justifying the claimed O(1) scaling for path mining, and the potential information loss from averaging attention head activations. However, these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing concepts like activation clustering (common in mechanistic interpretability) and concept attribution (TCAV, ConLUX, ConceptDistil), its novelty lies in the specific synthesis: using unsupervised clustering layer-wise, explicitly modeling concept *transformations* across layers using transition matrices and path mining (prefixSpan), and applying this framework with a strong focus on scalability to very large models (100B+ params). This approach differs from prior work focusing on distillation, local explanations, or static concept vectors. The emphasis on tracking dynamic concept pathways through the network depth is a fresh perspective."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established techniques like GMMs, BIC, Mutual Information, and path mining. The methodology is logical, and the evaluation plan includes relevant metrics and baselines. However, there are minor areas needing further justification: 1) The practical computation of the intervention influence metric (\\Delta b(m)) needs more detail, particularly the definition and calculation of the derivative with respect to a concept derived from cluster activations. 2) The claim of achieving O(1) scaling complexity in path mining seems optimistic and requires clarification regarding the assumptions or the specifics of the 'layerwise compression'. 3) Averaging activations across attention heads is a pragmatic choice for scalability but represents a simplification that might impact the fidelity of the analysis. Despite these points, the core approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The ambition to scale to 100B+ parameter models and process activations for 100,000+ inputs requires substantial computational resources and sophisticated engineering, potentially beyond typical academic lab capabilities. Curating diverse, high-quality concept datasets (D_c) remains a non-trivial bottleneck, as highlighted in the literature. While the individual techniques are known, integrating them into a robust, scalable framework (ConceptMapper Toolkit) is a considerable undertaking. The human comprehension study also adds logistical complexity. The project is feasible in principle but carries notable risks related to scale, data availability, and achieving the claimed performance improvements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical challenge of understanding and attributing the behavior of large, complex 'black-box' models, which is central to AI safety, fairness, and trustworthiness. Successfully developing a scalable framework like ConceptMapper, capable of linking activations to human-understandable concepts and tracking their transformations, would be a major advancement in interpretability. The potential impacts on diagnosing biases, understanding emergent capabilities, enabling targeted interventions, and informing data curation are substantial and align perfectly with the goals outlined in the task description."
