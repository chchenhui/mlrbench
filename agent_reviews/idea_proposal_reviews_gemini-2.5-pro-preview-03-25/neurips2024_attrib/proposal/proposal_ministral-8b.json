    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on attributing model behavior to internal components, specifically bridging mechanistic (activation patterns) and concept-based interpretability. The methodology clearly builds upon the research idea, aiming to map latent concepts via activation clustering and attribute behavior. It positions itself well within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging the importance of concept-based explanations while proposing a specific approach combining clustering and attribution. It explicitly aims to tackle challenges mentioned in the task, such as understanding black-box models and attributing behavior to subcomponents."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The objectives, overall methodology (clustering, attribution, tracking, visualization), and significance are clearly articulated. However, some key methodological details lack sufficient clarity. For instance, how activation clustering will be performed and compared across different layers, how the potentially noisy and vast ConceptNet dataset will be effectively utilized for robust attribution, the precise mechanism for 'attributing model behaviors to specific concept combinations' beyond tracking, and the specifics of the visualization tool could be defined more sharply. While generally understandable, these ambiguities prevent a higher score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality. While concept-based interpretability and activation analysis are existing fields (as shown in the literature review), the specific approach of combining unsupervised activation clustering across layers to identify latent structures, mapping these structures to a broad external concept dataset (like ConceptNet), and then tracking the transformation of these mapped concepts through the network presents a novel synthesis. It differs from methods focusing solely on post-hoc explanations for predefined concepts (like ConLUX or ConceptDistil) or learning inherently interpretable representations. The novelty lies in the proposed mechanism for bridging internal structures with external semantics at scale."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, relying on established techniques like activation clustering, concept embeddings, and similarity measures. However, its rigor is limited by a lack of detail on critical aspects. Potential weaknesses include: the challenge of ensuring activation clusters correspond to meaningful semantic units, the difficulty of reliably mapping these clusters to concepts from a potentially noisy source like ConceptNet (a challenge highlighted indirectly by Ramaswamy et al. regarding concept salience/learnability), the unspecified mechanism for tracking concept 'transformations' across layers, and the lack of detail on how evaluation metrics like 'faithfulness' will be rigorously measured. The proposal doesn't explicitly state how it will mitigate known challenges from the literature (e.g., dataset dependence, concept learnability). Technical formulations are absent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Required resources (models, data, compute) are standard, and core techniques (clustering, embeddings) are available. However, scaling activation clustering to large models, effectively managing and mapping to a large concept dataset like ConceptNet, ensuring the robustness and validity of the concept mapping, implementing the cross-layer tracking mechanism, and developing a useful visualization tool pose significant hurdles. Rigorous evaluation, especially for faithfulness and user understanding, also requires careful design and execution. These challenges introduce moderate risks to successful implementation without further refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and pressing problem in machine learning: understanding the internal workings of complex black-box models. Bridging mechanistic and concept-based interpretability, attributing behavior to understandable concepts, and enabling bias detection/mitigation are critical for trustworthy AI. If successful, the framework could provide substantial advancements in model transparency, debugging, and safety. The potential impact on the field, aligning directly with the goals outlined in the task description, is excellent."
