    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Attributing Model Behavior at Scale' by focusing on attributing behavior to internal model components via concept-based interpretability. It logically expands on the research idea of mapping latent concepts and tracking their flow. Furthermore, it explicitly references the provided literature (Ramaswamy et al., Marconato et al., ConLUX, ConceptDistil) and positions its approach to tackle identified challenges like dataset dependence (via unsupervised discovery), alignment (via flow tracking), and limitations of static methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Outcomes). The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the proposed steps, including data collection, algorithmic details (clustering, labeling, graph construction), and validation strategy. Specific techniques (K-Means, GMM, CLIP) are mentioned. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise handling of dimensionality reduction, the specifics of ontology-based labeling, and the exact formulation of the 'Concept Influence Score', but overall the proposal is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While components like activation clustering and using CLIP for associating semantics exist, the core novelty lies in integrating these into a framework that focuses on *tracking the dynamic evolution and transformation* of *unsupervisedly discovered* concepts across network layers ('Concept Flow'). This contrasts significantly with static concept attribution methods (like TCAV relying on predefined concepts) or methods focusing only on final layer explanations. The automated labeling approach and the concept flow graph representation contribute to the novelty, addressing limitations highlighted in the literature (Ramaswamy et al.)."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established ML techniques (clustering, activation analysis, CLIP, graph theory). The methodology is generally well-defined, particularly the validation plan which includes relevant baselines, metrics (faithfulness, interpretability, robustness, scalability), and user studies. However, some aspects could benefit from further justification: the assumption that stable, meaningful 'latent concepts' can always be reliably found via unsupervised clustering of activations needs empirical backing; the discrete assignment of activations to the nearest centroid might be an oversimplification; the 'Concept Influence Score' lacks a precise definition. Technical formulations are present and mostly correct but relatively basic."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and resources. It relies on standard pre-trained models, datasets, ML libraries, and readily available tools like CLIP. The computational steps (activation extraction, clustering, CLIP inference, graph construction) are achievable with standard GPU resources, although scalability might become a challenge for extremely large models or datasets. Key risks involve the quality and stability of the unsupervised clustering and the effectiveness of the automated labeling, especially for non-visual or abstract concepts. The planned user studies add complexity but are standard for interpretability research. Overall, the plan is realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and pressing problem in machine learning: understanding the internal workings of complex 'black-box' models to attribute their behavior. Improving interpretability is crucial for debugging, ensuring fairness and safety, building trust, and advancing scientific understanding. By aiming to provide a dynamic, hierarchical view of concept processing and bridge mechanistic and concept-based approaches, the research has the potential for substantial impact. It directly tackles limitations of existing methods identified in the literature and aligns perfectly with the goals of the workshop, potentially leading to valuable tools and insights for the AI community."
