    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core theme of 'Attributing Model Behavior at Scale' by focusing on attributing behavior to model subcomponents (concepts) and bridging mechanistic and concept-based interpretability, as mentioned in the task's 'Trained models' section. It faithfully implements the core 'Concept Mapping' research idea, detailing the process of activation clustering, concept attribution, and tracking. Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as dataset dependence (by attempting unsupervised discovery first) and human interpretability limits (via visualization), while positioning itself relative to existing works like TCAV and ConceptDistil."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is broken down into logical, well-described steps (Data Collection, Clustering, Attribution, Tracking, Visualization, Experiments) with specific techniques (PCA, hierarchical clustering, linear probing, Hungarian algorithm, Shapley values) and relevant formulas. The structure is logical, flowing from introduction to methods and impact. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact interplay between unsupervised clustering and the curated dataset for mapping, the specifics of 'editing concept representations', and the precise method for selecting 'k' clusters beyond mentioning the gap statistic, but these do not significantly obscure the overall proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like activation clustering, linear probing for concepts, and cross-layer analysis exist in the literature, the proposed *integrated framework* combining unsupervised discovery of latent concepts within layers, subsequent mapping to human semantics, and systematic tracking of these concept transformations across the network offers a novel approach. It distinguishes itself from methods requiring predefined concepts from the start (like TCAV) or model-agnostic distillation (like ConceptDistil). The emphasis on discovering latent representations first and then mapping/tracking them constitutes a fresh perspective, although it builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing entirely groundbreaking methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established ML techniques (PCA, clustering, linear probing, Hungarian algorithm, Shapley values). The methodology is generally well-defined, and the experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and case studies. However, there are areas requiring further justification or potential refinement. The heuristic nature of cross-layer cluster tracking using centroid similarity might lack stability or clear semantic meaning. The effectiveness and methodology of 'editing concept representations' are underspecified. Assumptions underlying linear probing (capturing complex concepts) and Shapley values (computational cost, feature independence assumptions applied to concepts) might be limitations. Technical formulations presented are correct, but the practical robustness of the integrated system needs empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current technology and standard ML libraries/datasets. The core steps involve well-known algorithms. However, potential challenges exist. Hierarchical clustering can be computationally expensive (O(N^2) or more) for the proposed number of activations (10k samples per dataset across multiple layers), potentially requiring sampling or alternative clustering methods. Calculating Shapley values for a potentially large number of discovered concepts can also be computationally intensive, likely necessitating approximations. Developing the interactive visualization tool and conducting user studies requires significant effort. While implementable, it demands substantial computational resources and careful engineering, posing moderate implementation challenges and risks related to the quality/stability of clustering and tracking."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem in machine learning: the opacity of black-box models and the need for reliable behavior attribution. By aiming to bridge mechanistic and concept-based interpretability and provide a framework for tracing concept evolution within models, it has the potential for major impact. Successful execution could lead to substantial advancements in understanding model internals, diagnosing biases, ensuring safety, and enabling more targeted interventions than full retraining. The potential contributions to research (unified interpretability), industry (debugging, auditing), and society (trustworthy AI) are substantial and clearly articulated."
