    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core task of attributing model behavior to internal components using concept-based interpretability. It systematically builds upon the research idea of mapping latent concepts and bridging interpretability approaches. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges the cited literature (ConLUX, ConceptDistil, Ramaswamy et al.) and positions itself to address identified challenges like dataset dependence (via unsupervised discovery) and alignment. The objectives and methodology directly target the goals outlined in the task description related to understanding model subcomponents through concepts."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure with well-defined objectives, methodology sections with algorithms, a detailed experimental plan, and expected outcomes. The core ideas of Latent Concept Mapping (LCM) are understandable. However, some technical details within the algorithms could be more precise (e.g., exact derivation of projection matrices P^l_k in Alg 1, training details for alignment probabilities in Alg 2, practical computation of Jacobian expectation in Alg 3, selection of alpha in Alg 4). Despite these minor ambiguities, the overall proposal is well-written and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing concepts in interpretability (clustering activations, concept attribution), the proposed LCM framework integrates these in a novel way. Key novel aspects include: 1) Prioritizing unsupervised discovery of latent concepts before alignment with human labels, potentially reducing reliance on predefined concept datasets. 2) Explicitly modeling and tracking concept transformations across layers using influence matrices based on Jacobians (Algorithm 3). 3) Combining discovery, alignment, flow tracking, and intervention into a unified framework. This approach offers a fresh perspective compared to cited works like TCAV, ConLUX, or ConceptDistil, aiming for a deeper, layer-wise understanding of concept processing."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has some gaps in methodological rigor. It builds on established techniques (PCA, clustering, gradients). However, Algorithm 3 (Concept Flow Tracking) relies on computing an expectation of Jacobians, which could be computationally prohibitive and sensitive to noise; the proposal lacks detail on how this will be practically and robustly estimated. The effectiveness of the linear projection for concept subspaces (Alg 1) and the direct activation modification for intervention (Alg 4) are strong assumptions needing thorough validation, as interventions might have unintended side effects. While acknowledging literature challenges (e.g., dataset dependence), the reliance on a curated concept dataset for alignment (Alg 2) still inherits some of these known issues."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The primary concern is the computational cost and potential instability of Algorithm 3 (Concept Flow Tracking), involving Jacobian calculations across layers and concepts, averaged over inputs. Scaling this to large models (as intended in Experiment 4) could be extremely demanding. Data collection (activations, curated concept dataset) is manageable but requires effort. The experimental plan is comprehensive but resource-intensive, requiring multiple large models, datasets, and complex evaluations (including ground-truth attribution). There's a moderate risk that the core flow-tracking mechanism might prove too computationally expensive or unreliable in practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and largely unsolved problem of model behavior attribution, which is fundamental to AI safety, explainability, and trustworthiness. Successfully developing the LCM framework would provide a powerful tool for understanding complex models, enabling precise attribution, targeted interventions, better safety analysis, and potentially more efficient training. Bridging mechanistic and concept-based interpretability is a key goal in the field. The expected outcomes (atlas, tool, benchmarks) would be valuable contributions with broad impact across AI research and practice."
