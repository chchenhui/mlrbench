        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for understanding how training data composition affects model behavior, specifically mentioning 'Data leakage/contamination' and 'how do data feedback loops (e.g., training on LLM-generated outputs) influence model biases?'. The proposed idea directly addresses this by focusing on detecting synthetic data (LLM outputs) in training corpora and analyzing its impact on downstream model behavior, fitting squarely within the 'Data' topic of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (risk of model collapse from synthetic data), the core proposal (scalable fingerprinting and impact analysis), the methods (statistical artifacts, controlled injection, metric quantification), and the desired outcome (framework for estimation and causal effect) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It is immediately understandable what the research aims to achieve and how."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While detecting synthetic text and analyzing model robustness are existing research areas, the focus on developing *lightweight, scalable* fingerprinting techniques specifically for *massive pre-training corpora* offers a novel angle compared to computationally intensive model-based detectors. Furthermore, the systematic study of the *causal impact* of varying levels and types of synthetic data contamination on a range of downstream metrics (diversity, bias, hallucination) within a unified framework provides a fresh perspective on the 'model collapse' problem. It combines existing concepts in a timely and relevant way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Developing statistical fingerprints is achievable, although identifying robust and truly scalable markers requires careful work. Injecting controlled amounts of synthetic data and training models to measure impact is a standard, albeit potentially computationally expensive, experimental methodology in ML. Accessing diverse LLMs for data generation and suitable 'clean' datasets is generally possible for research labs. The main challenge lies in achieving the proposed 'scalability' for detection on truly massive, web-scale corpora, but the core research of developing the methods and performing the impact analysis on representative datasets is highly practical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. The proliferation of LLM-generated content and its potential contamination of future training data ('model collapse') is a critical, widely recognized problem facing the AI community. Developing effective methods to detect this contamination at scale and rigorously quantifying its impact on model capabilities, biases, and reliability addresses a fundamental challenge for the sustainable development of powerful language models. The outcomes could directly inform data curation practices and mitigation strategies, having major implications for the field."
