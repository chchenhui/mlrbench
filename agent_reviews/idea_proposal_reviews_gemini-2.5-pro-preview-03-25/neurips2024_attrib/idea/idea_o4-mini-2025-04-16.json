        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenge of 'Data attribution and selection' mentioned under the 'Data' topic, specifically focusing on how to '(efficiently) attribute model outputs back to specific training examples' at scale. It also implicitly relates to 'Data leakage/contamination' by providing a method to detect influential (potentially problematic) data points. The motivation explicitly mentions the intractability of attribution for large models and datasets, which is a central theme of the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (Coreset Influence Graph), the two-stage approach (group-level approximation followed by fine-grained analysis), and the expected outcomes are well-defined. The use of specific techniques like low-rank Hessian inverses and randomized sketching provides technical grounding. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific clustering method for coresets or the precise error bounds of the approximations, but the overall research direction is understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While influence functions, approximate methods (like sketching for Hessian approximations), and coresets are existing concepts, their combination into a hierarchical 'Coreset Influence Graph' for scalable data attribution appears novel. The innovation lies in structuring the attribution problem hierarchically using data clusters (coresets) and leveraging approximations at the cluster level before drilling down, offering a new approach compared to purely example-based or simpler approximation techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Computing approximate influence functions, even with low-rank Hessians and sketching, remains computationally intensive for massive models/datasets, although significantly less than exact methods. The success depends on the quality of the coreset clustering (semantic coherence) and the accuracy of the cluster-level influence approximations. Integrating these components (clustering, sketching, approximate influence calculation, hierarchical filtering) into a robust pipeline requires significant engineering effort and validation. However, the underlying techniques are established in ML research, making it plausible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Efficiently attributing model behavior to training data at the scale of modern foundation models is a critical unsolved problem. Success in this area would enable better model debugging, bias detection/mitigation, targeted data curation, understanding of data contamination effects, and overall transparency. The expected outcomes directly address major pain points in large-scale ML development and align with the task's goal of advancing understanding of model behavior attribution."
