    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Data' topic outlined in the workshop call, specifically focusing on 'Data attribution and selection' (attributing model outputs to training examples, selecting data for optimization) and 'Data leakage/contamination' (monitoring leakage at scale). The motivation and main ideas align perfectly with the workshop's goal of understanding how training data composition affects model behavior and attributing behavior back to controllable factors like the dataset."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-stated, and the main idea is broken down into logical, understandable components: attribution methodology, data selection framework, and leakage monitoring. Specific techniques (SHAP, LIME, Active Learning, RL) are mentioned, providing concrete direction. The expected outcomes and potential impact are also clearly articulated, leaving little room for ambiguity about the research goals."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The novelty is satisfactory. While the individual components (SHAP/LIME for interpretability, active learning/RL for selection, leakage monitoring) are known concepts, their proposed integration for attributing model outputs specifically to *training examples* and using this attribution to drive data selection via AL/RL offers a degree of originality. However, it doesn't propose fundamentally groundbreaking techniques but rather a novel application and combination of existing ones. Research on influence functions and other data attribution methods already exists, making this an incremental rather than transformative step."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility is somewhat challenging. While conceptually sound, applying methods like SHAP or LIME to attribute influence back to potentially millions of individual training examples for large models is computationally very expensive and may not scale effectively. Significant engineering effort and potentially approximations would be needed. The active learning and RL components add further complexity to the training pipeline. Monitoring leakage 'at scale' is also non-trivial. Therefore, while feasible in principle or at smaller scales, achieving this robustly 'at scale' as described presents considerable practical hurdles with the proposed methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant importance and impact potential. Understanding data influence, optimizing training datasets, improving efficiency, and mitigating biases/leakage are critical challenges in contemporary machine learning, especially for large models. A successful framework for data attribution and selection would offer substantial benefits in terms of model performance, resource savings, trustworthiness, and fairness, making valuable contributions to the field and having practical applications across various domains."
