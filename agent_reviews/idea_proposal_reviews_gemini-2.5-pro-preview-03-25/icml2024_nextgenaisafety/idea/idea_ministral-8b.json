        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses the first emerging trend listed in the task description: 'Agentic AI'. It specifically focuses on the core questions raised for this trend: ensuring agents respect privacy (via differential privacy) and adhere to safety protocols (via AI alignment and robust control theory). The alignment with the task requirements is excellent."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly, outlining the motivation, main concept, methodology (listing specific techniques like differential privacy, AI alignment, robust control), expected outcomes, and potential impact. The structure is logical and the language is precise, making the proposal easily understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The core techniques proposed (differential privacy, AI alignment, robust control theory) are established fields. The novelty lies primarily in the specific synthesis and integration of these three approaches into a unified framework tailored for the privacy and safety challenges of agentic AI. While applying these techniques to AI safety isn't entirely new, the proposed combination and focus offer moderate originality."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The individual components of the methodology are based on existing research areas and techniques, suggesting feasibility. Implementing differential privacy, designing alignment mechanisms, and incorporating robust control are all active areas of research with known methods. Building a prototype and conducting empirical studies are achievable. However, effectively integrating these diverse techniques and managing the inherent trade-offs (e.g., privacy vs. utility, safety vs. performance) presents moderate implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant and timely problem. As AI agents become more autonomous, ensuring their safety and preserving user privacy are critical for societal trust and responsible adoption. Developing robust protocols, as proposed, could lead to major advancements in AI safety practices and mitigate substantial risks associated with agentic AI, aligning perfectly with the goals of the task description."
