    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly and comprehensively addresses the 'Dangerous Capabilities' challenge (point 5), focusing on preventing AI misuse for harmful knowledge (bioweapons, cyberattacks) while enabling beneficial research. It also explicitly incorporates 'Multimodal AI' (point 2) by mentioning multimodal natural language understanding for intent detection, thus addressing two of the five key emerging trends highlighted in the task."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, the core problem (balancing harm mitigation and scientific progress), the proposed hybrid framework (intent detection, content sensitivity analysis via KGs, ethical justification layers), the training methodology (adversarial datasets, expert annotation), and the deployment mechanism (tiered review) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The expected outcomes are quantified, further enhancing clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While concepts like content filtering, intent detection, and knowledge graphs exist individually, the proposed *integrated framework* combining multimodal intent analysis, domain-specific KG-based sensitivity assessment, *and* explicit ethical justification layers specifically for the dual-use knowledge problem is innovative. The focus on adversarial training with legitimate/malicious pairs annotated by interdisciplinary experts and the tiered human-AI audit system adds to the novelty of the approach for this specific high-stakes application."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Building accurate multimodal intent detection, especially for subtle malicious intent disguised as research, is difficult. Constructing comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date domain-specific knowledge graphs for sensitivity analysis is a major undertaking. Defining and operationalizing 'ethical justification layers' is complex and potentially subjective. Generating high-quality adversarial datasets requires significant, costly expert annotation (bioethicists, cybersecurity experts). While the components use known techniques, their integration and the required resources make implementation non-trivial."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and urgent problem in AI safety – preventing the misuse of powerful AI for generating or disseminating dangerous knowledge, which could have catastrophic consequences. Successfully balancing this mitigation with the need for scientific progress is paramount for the responsible development of AI. This research directly tackles one of the most severe risks associated with advanced AI, as highlighted in the task description."
