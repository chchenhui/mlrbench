    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Dangerous Capabilities' challenge outlined in the task, proposing a solution precisely based on the 'Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filtering' idea. The methodology explicitly incorporates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as balancing helpfulness/harmlessness, risk-aware decision making (citing specific papers [1, 2, 3]), integrating human feedback (RLHF), and adapting to threats. The introduction clearly frames the problem within the context provided by the task description, and the objectives perfectly match the research idea."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology is broken down into logical stages (Risk Classification, Policy Enforcement, RLHF Fine-tuning, Evaluation) with detailed explanations for each component, including data curation, model architecture, policy logic, RLHF process, and evaluation metrics/baselines. The overall architecture is clearly described. Minor areas, like the precise implementation details of the 'Safe Completion Templates' or the specifics of risk-aware RL objective integration, could be slightly more elaborated, but the overall proposal is immediately understandable and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like text classification and RLHF are established, their integration into a multi-stage, dynamic risk-adaptive filter specifically for dangerous capabilities is novel. Key innovative aspects include: 1) The use of a continuous risk score to drive a multi-level policy (Allow, Template, Refuse), moving beyond simple binary classification/refusal. 2) The concept of 'Safe Completion Templates' for medium-risk queries offers a nuanced intermediate response. 3) The explicit plan to integrate *risk-aware* RLHF concepts (referencing recent work like RA-PbRL [2] and CVaR RL [3]) to fine-tune the safety/utility trade-off specifically for this high-stakes problem. This combination represents a fresh and sophisticated approach compared to static blocklists or standard RLHF alignment."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in solid machine learning principles (transformer-based classifiers, RLHF/PPO). The methodology is well-justified, detailing data requirements (including adversarial examples and a threat taxonomy), model training procedures, a logical policy enforcement mechanism, and a standard-yet-adapted RLHF process. The inclusion of risk-aware RL concepts from recent literature ([2], [3]) adds theoretical depth. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant metrics (FNR, FPR), strong baselines, robustness checks, and ablation studies. Technical formulations, like the RL objective, are presented correctly. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges (data, robustness) appropriately."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but presents significant implementation challenges. Key requirements include substantial effort in curating a high-quality, diverse, and representative dataset (including dangerous and adversarial examples), significant computational resources for training transformers and running RLHF, and access to human annotators for preference data. Fine-tuning the risk-aware RLHF component effectively might require considerable experimentation. While complex, the steps are clearly defined, and the approach doesn't rely on unproven technologies. The main risks lie in the data acquisition effort and the practical optimization of the RLHF stage."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly tackles a critical AI safety problem – preventing the misuse of powerful AI for generating dangerous information – identified as a key challenge in the task description. Success would represent a major advancement over current static or overly broad safety filters, offering a way to enhance safety significantly while minimizing the negative impact on the legitimate utility of AI for research and innovation. The potential impact spans improved public safety, increased trust in AI, advancement of AI safety techniques (especially in applied RLHF and risk modeling), and practical tools for responsible AI deployment."
