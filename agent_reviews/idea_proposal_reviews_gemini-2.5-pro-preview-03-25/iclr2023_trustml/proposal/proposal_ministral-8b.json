    "Consistency": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the research idea and the literature review, focusing on the trade-off between computational constraints and trustworthiness (specifically fairness and robustness). It directly addresses one of the key questions in the task description regarding the impact of computational limitations on trustworthiness and potential algorithmic mitigation strategies. However, it narrows the scope of 'trustworthiness' compared to the broader list in the task description (omitting privacy, explainability, etc.) and doesn't explicitly address the 'statistical limitations' (data scarcity) also mentioned in the task. While this focus is reasonable for a specific project, it means it doesn't cover the full breadth of the task description."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear and well-structured, with defined objectives and a logical flow. The methodology is broken down into understandable steps (empirical analysis, algorithm development, theoretical analysis). However, some key technical details are lacking. Specifically, the mechanism for the 'Adaptive Training Scheduler' (how resource availability and model state dynamically adjust weights) is vague. Similarly, the approach for the 'Theoretical Analysis' is not specified, making it hard to grasp the exact plan. While the overall concept is clear, these ambiguities prevent a higher score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a timely and relevant problem. However, the literature review indicates that balancing fairness/robustness and efficiency, adaptive resource allocation, and dynamic scheduling under constraints are active research areas with several recent papers (e.g., papers 6, 7, 9, 10 from the review). The proposed approach (empirical study + adaptive scheduler + theory) seems like a logical next step within this existing line of research rather than a groundbreaking new direction. The novelty likely lies in the specific implementation of the dynamic scheduler or the particular theoretical insights sought, but these are not detailed enough in the proposal to firmly establish significant originality. It appears more incremental than highly innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on generally sound principles, employing standard methodologies for empirical analysis (model simplification, varying epochs) and evaluation (standard fairness/robustness metrics). The use of weighted loss functions for multi-objective optimization is established practice. However, the soundness of the core algorithmic contribution – the adaptive scheduler – is difficult to fully assess due to the lack of detail regarding its mechanism. How 'resource availability' and 'model state' are measured and used to update weights is crucial and unspecified. The theoretical analysis plan is also too vague to evaluate its rigor. The provided equations are standard definitions, not the novel part of the method."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research plan appears largely feasible. The empirical analysis uses standard techniques and datasets (though access to specific clinical data might require arrangements). Simulating computational constraints is straightforward. Implementing a dynamic scheduler, integrating fairness/robustness losses, and running experiments on benchmarks like ImageNet are achievable with standard ML infrastructure and expertise, although potentially computationally intensive. The main uncertainty lies in the theoretical analysis, whose feasibility depends on the specific questions tackled, and potentially in securing specific clinical datasets. Overall, the core experimental and algorithmic components are practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: ensuring ML trustworthiness (fairness, robustness) under practical computational constraints. This is critical for the ethical and reliable deployment of AI in resource-limited settings and sensitive applications (healthcare, autonomous systems), directly aligning with the motivation of the task description. Successfully developing methods to navigate the efficiency-trustworthiness trade-off would provide substantial practical value to ML practitioners and could contribute meaningfully to the field of Trustworthy ML. The potential impact on reducing disparities in ML accessibility and reliability is high."
