    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-aligned with the research idea, expanding on its core concepts directly. It strongly aligns with the literature review, citing relevant recent work and addressing identified challenges like trade-offs and adaptive allocation. It directly tackles a key question from the task description regarding the impact of computational limitations on trustworthiness (fairness, robustness) and the associated trade-offs. However, it focuses primarily on computational constraints, giving less direct attention to the statistical limitations (data scarcity) also mentioned in the task description. It also focuses mainly on the efficiency vs. trustworthiness trade-off, rather than potential trade-offs *between* different trustworthiness aspects under constraints, which was another point in the task description."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology (split into three distinct phases), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. The description of the EfficientTrust framework, including the adaptive loss function and dynamic scheduler, is understandable. Minor details, such as the precise mechanism for tuning the adaptive parameters (\\alpha, \\beta) or handling potential instability in the dynamic adjustments, could be elaborated further, but this does not significantly detract from the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing concepts like multi-objective optimization, adaptive resource allocation, and trade-off analysis (as evidenced by the literature review), it integrates these ideas into a specific framework (EfficientTrust) focused explicitly on the compute-trustworthiness axis. The proposed dynamic adaptation mechanism, which considers both current trustworthiness metrics and remaining computational budget, appears to offer a novel refinement over existing general approaches. The combination of empirical quantification, a specific adaptive algorithm, and theoretical analysis (including bounds relating compute to trustworthiness) provides a fresh perspective on this important problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established ML concepts (fairness/robustness metrics, model simplification) and optimization techniques (Pareto frontiers, multi-objective optimization). The methodology for empirical analysis, algorithm design (EfficientTrust), and validation (baselines, metrics, statistical tests) is well-defined and appropriate. The technical formulations provided (adaptive loss, Pareto optimization) are correct. The theoretical goals (deriving bounds, proving convergence) are ambitious and standard for rigorous research in this area, although achieving strong, general results often requires careful assumptions and significant effort. The reliance on standard techniques and metrics provides a solid foundation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The empirical evaluation (Phase 1) and algorithmic development (Phase 2, EfficientTrust implementation) are practical with adequate computational resources and ML expertise, although potentially time-consuming. Public datasets and standard techniques are proposed. The main challenge lies in Phase 3 (Theoretical Analysis). Deriving tight theoretical bounds and proving convergence for dynamic, non-convex optimization problems can be very difficult and represents a research risk. The overall project requires significant computational power for experiments across different models, datasets, and budget constraints. Creating a robust open-source library also requires dedicated effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and increasingly critical problem: ensuring ML trustworthiness (fairness, robustness) under practical computational constraints. This is crucial for deploying AI responsibly in resource-limited settings (edge computing, mobile health) and time-sensitive applications (autonomous systems). Success would yield practical algorithms and guidelines, potentially enabling more equitable and reliable AI deployment. The research bridges the gap between theoretical trustworthy ML goals and practical deployment challenges. The potential impact on both academic understanding (theoretical limits) and real-world practice (EfficientTrust framework) is substantial."
