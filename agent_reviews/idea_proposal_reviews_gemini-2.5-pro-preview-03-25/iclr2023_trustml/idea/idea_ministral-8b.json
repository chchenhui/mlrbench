    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Pitfalls of limited data and computation for Trustworthy ML'. It explicitly tackles both statistical limitations (using SSL for limited labeled data) and computational limitations (using model compression). Furthermore, it incorporates key trustworthiness aspects mentioned in the task, such as fairness and privacy, and proposes evaluating trade-offs, robustness, and explainability, which directly responds to the workshop's solicited questions regarding the impact of these limitations and potential mitigation strategies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the proposed methodology is broken down into logical steps (SSL, compression, fairness/privacy integration, evaluation). The specific techniques mentioned are generally understood. Minor ambiguity exists regarding the precise nature of the 'hybrid' integration â€“ how exactly SSL and compression techniques will be combined synergistically beyond just applying them sequentially or in parallel. However, the overall goal and approach are understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While the individual components (SSL for limited data, model compression for efficiency, fairness/privacy techniques) are established research areas, the proposed novelty lies in their specific combination and application. Systematically integrating SSL *and* model compression *simultaneously* to enhance *multiple* trustworthiness dimensions (fairness, privacy, robustness, explainability) under *both* data and computational constraints represents a fresh perspective and a potentially valuable synthesis of existing concepts for this specific problem setting."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core techniques proposed (SSL variants, pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, differential privacy, fairness-aware losses) are well-researched and have existing implementations. Combining these techniques is technically achievable, although it will require careful engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Evaluating the trade-offs requires standard methodologies used in ML research. Access to datasets and simulating resource constraints are practical. The main challenge lies in managing the complexity and potential conflicts when optimizing for accuracy, efficiency, and multiple trustworthiness metrics simultaneously, but this is a common research challenge rather than an insurmountable barrier."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: ensuring ML trustworthiness in practical scenarios often characterized by limited data and computational resources. This is crucial for deploying ML responsibly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, especially on edge devices or in less-resourced settings. Developing effective methods to maintain fairness, privacy, and robustness under these constraints would be a major advancement with substantial real-world implications, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the task description."
