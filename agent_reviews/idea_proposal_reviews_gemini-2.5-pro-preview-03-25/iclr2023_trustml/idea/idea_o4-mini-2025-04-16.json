        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions addressing the impact of computational limitations on trustworthiness aspects like fairness, and exploring trade-offs between computational efficiency and trustworthiness. This idea directly tackles the challenge of estimating fairness metrics under compute constraints, proposing an adaptive method to manage the trade-off between evaluation cost (compute) and certification precision (fairness guarantees). It fits squarely within the workshop's theme of 'Pitfalls of limited data and computation for Trustworthy ML' and addresses the specific question regarding computational limitations impacting fairness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (cost of fairness evaluation on constrained devices), the main technical components (adaptive stratified sampling, control variates), the mechanism (dynamic batch sizing, compute budget, statistical guarantees), and the expected outcomes (theoretical bounds, empirical speedup) are all clearly articulated and easy to understand. The specific fairness metrics mentioned (demographic parity, equality-of-opportunity) and the goal of achieving (ε, δ) guarantees provide concrete details. While implementation specifics are omitted, the core concept is exceptionally well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While the individual components (stratified sampling, control variates, adaptive algorithms, fairness metrics) are known in ML and statistics, their specific combination and application to achieve adaptive, budget-aware fairness estimation with statistical guarantees appears innovative. The focus on dynamically adjusting mini-batch composition and size based on variance estimates and a compute budget specifically for fairness metrics like demographic parity and equality-of-opportunity, coupled with theoretical bounds, offers a fresh perspective on efficient and trustworthy ML monitoring under constraints. It's not introducing a completely new paradigm but offers a novel synthesis for a relevant problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible. The proposed techniques (stratified sampling, variance reduction via control variates, adaptive algorithms) are generally well-established and implementable within standard ML frameworks. Data for fairness benchmarks (tabular, vision) is available. The main challenges would lie in the theoretical analysis (deriving tight sample complexity bounds) and potentially in identifying highly effective control variates for specific fairness metrics and model architectures, but these are standard research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks. The empirical evaluation plan is standard and achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Efficiently and reliably estimating fairness under computational constraints is a critical problem for deploying trustworthy ML systems, especially on edge devices or in real-time monitoring scenarios. Addressing this bottleneck could enable fairness considerations in applications where they were previously computationally prohibitive. Providing statistical guarantees (ε, δ bounds) adds rigor and trustworthiness to the estimation process. The claimed potential for substantial reduction in evaluation time (5x) would be a major practical contribution, directly addressing the need for efficient auditing and certification methods highlighted in the task description."
