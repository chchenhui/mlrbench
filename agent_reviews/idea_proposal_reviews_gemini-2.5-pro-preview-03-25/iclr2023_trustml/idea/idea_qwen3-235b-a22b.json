        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core themes of limited data (via Active Learning), computational limitations (lightweight models, quantized activations), and their impact on Trustworthy ML, specifically focusing on Privacy (Differential Privacy) and Robustness (distribution shift). It proposes a concrete algorithmic technique (DP-Active) to mitigate these issues, directly responding to the task's call for such solutions and addressing key questions about mitigating trustworthiness issues under constraints."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly defines the motivation, the core components (DP, AL, robustness optimization, lightweight models), the proposed mechanism (joint modeling for sample selection, dynamic privacy budget), and the evaluation plan. The hypothesis is well-stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific mathematical formulation of the joint selection criteria and the exact mechanism for dynamic privacy budget allocation, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While research exists on combining pairs of concepts (e.g., DP+AL, Robustness+AL, AL+Compute Constraints), the proposed simultaneous integration of all four aspects (Differential Privacy, Active Learning, Robustness Optimization, and Compute Constraints) within a single framework appears innovative. The specific approach of jointly modeling privacy cost and robustness utility for sample selection, coupled with dynamic privacy budget allocation based on this utility, offers a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core technical components rely on established concepts: differential privacy mechanisms (like DP-SGD), active learning strategies, robustness metrics (uncertainty, risk measures), and lightweight model architectures (TF Lite). Medical imaging datasets like CheXpert are available for research. However, integrating these diverse elements effectively, particularly tuning the joint optimization criterion and the dynamic privacy budget allocation, presents significant research and engineering challenges. Achieving a good balance between privacy, robustness, accuracy, and efficiency might require considerable experimentation."

        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical challenge of building trustworthy ML systems (private and robust) under practical constraints of limited data and computational resources, particularly relevant for high-stakes domains like healthcare. Successfully developing such a framework could enable the deployment of reliable ML in settings where it is currently impractical, leading to major advancements and real-world benefits."
