    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for standardized, community-driven evaluation frameworks for generative AI's broader impacts, emphasizing stakeholder participation. It faithfully elaborates on the research idea's three-phase CoEval framework (Co-Design, Toolkit, Repository). Furthermore, it positions itself effectively within the literature, citing relevant work on participatory methods (Mun et al., Parthasarathy et al.) and evaluation standardization (Solaiman et al., Chouldechova et al.), directly tackling the identified challenges like lack of standards and limited stakeholder involvement."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The three-phase methodology is presented logically, with specific objectives, methods, and expected outcomes for each phase. The experimental design (piloting) and the metrics for evaluating the framework itself are clearly specified. The structure is logical and easy to follow, with minimal ambiguity. The core concepts of co-design, mixed-methods toolkit, and living repository are immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building upon existing concepts highlighted in the literature (participatory methods, evaluation frameworks, mixed-methods), its novelty lies in the specific, integrated, and operationalized three-phase framework (CoEval) designed explicitly for generative AI's societal impact. The emphasis on co-design *leading into* a modular toolkit and a living repository for policy influence represents a fresh, holistic approach. It's not introducing a completely new paradigm but offers a novel synthesis and practical implementation strategy for combining participatory approaches with structured evaluation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in principles of evaluation science and participatory research, aligning with needs identified by the community (e.g., NeurIPS) and recent literature. The proposed mixed-methods approach is appropriate for capturing diverse societal impacts. The phased methodology is logical, and the inclusion of piloting across different AI domains enhances rigor. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges (stakeholder engagement, privacy, scalability) and proposes mitigation strategies, demonstrating foresight. While details on specific computational metrics are light, the overall methodological design is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant coordination and implementation effort. Successfully identifying, recruiting, and managing diverse stakeholders for co-design workshops requires careful planning and resources. Developing a comprehensive yet modular toolkit and maintaining a 'living' repository also demands sustained effort. The proposal acknowledges key risks like stakeholder engagement and data privacy, offering mitigation strategies. The phased approach and piloting help manage complexity, making the ambitious plan generally realistic, though resource-intensive."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely gap: the lack of standardized, inclusive methods for assessing the societal impacts of generative AI. Developing such a framework could lead to major advancements in responsible AI development, evaluation practices, and evidence-based policymaking. The emphasis on multi-stakeholder collaboration and inclusivity directly tackles key ethical concerns. The potential contributions (validated metrics, open toolkit, policy recommendations) are substantial and could have a broad positive impact on the AI community and society."
