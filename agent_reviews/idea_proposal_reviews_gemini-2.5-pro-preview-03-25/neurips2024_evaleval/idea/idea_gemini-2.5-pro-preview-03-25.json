        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for developing future directions for 'effective community-driven evaluations' and emphasizes the 'breadth of participation' involving diverse stakeholders beyond ML experts. The proposed 'Co-Design Toolkit' directly addresses this by aiming to facilitate collaboration between AI developers and diverse community stakeholders to define context-specific impact metrics and evaluation protocols for Generative AI. It directly tackles the need for practical methods to incorporate non-expert input, which is a core theme of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (lack of methods for non-expert input), the core proposal (a Co-Design Toolkit with specific modules like scenario mapping, value elicitation, etc.), the target users (developers and stakeholders), the intended application (Generative AI impact assessment), and the expected outcomes (validated methodology, richer assessments). The use of pilot applications adds further clarity. Minor details about the specific nature of the 'accessible digital tools' could be elaborated, but the overall concept is immediately understandable and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While participatory design and co-design are established methodologies in fields like HCI, their specific application to the *technical impact assessment* of *Generative AI* through a structured, replicable toolkit is innovative. Current GenAI impact assessments often lack structured, participatory methods for metric definition and evaluation protocol design involving non-experts. This proposal offers a fresh approach by creating a dedicated toolkit to bridge this gap, combining existing concepts in a novel and needed context."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Developing structured methods and digital tools is achievable with expertise in co-design, HCI, and software development. Piloting the toolkit is a standard research practice. However, successfully recruiting, engaging, and facilitating meaningful collaboration among diverse stakeholders (especially non-technical ones) requires significant logistical effort, careful design to ensure accessibility and inclusivity, and robust facilitation skills. Validating the toolkit's effectiveness across different contexts and GenAI applications will also require considerable effort. It's feasible but requires substantial resources and interdisciplinary expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem highlighted in the task description: the lack of standardized, comprehensive methods for evaluating the broader societal impacts of Generative AI. By promoting participatory evaluation involving diverse stakeholders, the toolkit could lead to richer, more context-aware impact assessments, uncover risks missed by purely technical evaluations, and foster more responsible AI development aligned with community values. A successful toolkit could become a widely adopted resource, significantly advancing practices in responsible AI evaluation."
