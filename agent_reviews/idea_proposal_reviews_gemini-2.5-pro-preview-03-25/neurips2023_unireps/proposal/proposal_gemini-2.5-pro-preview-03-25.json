    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of unifying representations, focusing on the 'What for' (model merging, reuse, multimodal applications) and incorporating aspects of 'When' and 'Why' (using OT for alignment, identifiability). The objectives and methodology directly implement the research idea (OT for alignment, shared space, fusion, identifiability). It effectively situates itself within the provided literature, acknowledging prior work on OT for alignment (Li et al., Qian et al., etc.) and model merging (Sung et al.), while clearly stating its aim to provide a comprehensive framework for merging frozen pre-trained models via an OT-induced shared space."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from introduction and motivation to specific objectives, detailed methodology, and expected outcomes. The objectives are distinct and measurable. The methodology section provides specific technical details, including the mathematical formulation of the alignment loss, the proposed fusion mechanism (cross-attention), and the plan for identifiability analysis. The experimental design is clearly laid out with baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The language is precise and largely unambiguous, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While using Optimal Transport for cross-modal representation alignment is an active area with several recent works cited in the literature review (Li et al., Qian et al., Zhou et al., Smith et al., etc.), the proposal's specific focus is on creating a framework (OT-Align&Merge) to explicitly learn mappings into a shared space for the purpose of merging *frozen* pre-trained unimodal models, followed by training only a *lightweight* fusion module. This specific combination – OT alignment targeting efficient merging of frozen components with subsequent lightweight fusion and an explicit identifiability analysis – offers a novel angle compared to methods integrating alignment within end-to-end training or focusing solely on alignment itself. However, it primarily combines and applies existing concepts (OT, model merging principles, attention mechanisms) rather than introducing a fundamentally new technique."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (Optimal Transport for distribution alignment) and established deep learning techniques (MLPs for mappings, cross-attention for fusion). The proposed methodology is well-justified: using paired data to minimize distance in the target space is a standard alignment approach, freezing encoders aligns with the goal of reuse, and the fusion mechanism is appropriate. The technical formulation of the alignment loss is clear and correct. The plan for identifiability analysis includes relevant techniques (reconstruction loss, Jacobian analysis, MI). The experimental design is comprehensive, including necessary baselines (joint training, zero-shot), standard metrics, and ablation studies, ensuring rigorous validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on standard, publicly available datasets (MS-COCO, CC, VQA v2) and pre-trained models (ViT, BERT). The core computational tasks involve training relatively small networks (mapping MLPs, fusion module) while keeping large encoders frozen, which is significantly more efficient than end-to-end joint training. The proposed alignment loss (pairwise distance) is computationally tractable. Implementation can be done using standard ML libraries. The risks identified (effectiveness of simple loss, hyperparameter sensitivity) are typical research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in multimodal AI: the efficient combination of powerful pre-trained unimodal models. Successfully developing a method for seamless merging without full retraining would have substantial impact by reducing computational costs, democratizing access to large multimodal models, and promoting model reuse. It directly tackles the 'What for' aspect highlighted in the task description. Furthermore, the research promises insights into cross-modal alignment mechanisms and the trade-offs with identifiability, contributing to the theoretical understanding of representation learning. Potential applications in robotics, embodied AI, and content creation are broad and impactful."
