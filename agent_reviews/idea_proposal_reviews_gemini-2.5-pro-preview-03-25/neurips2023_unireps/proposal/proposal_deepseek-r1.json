        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key themes from the task description like 'unifying representations', 'model merging', 'representational alignment', 'identifiability', and 'multimodal learning'. It systematically expands on the research idea, providing details on methodology, data, and evaluation. Furthermore, it correctly positions itself within the provided literature, citing relevant recent work on OT for cross-modal alignment and model merging, and acknowledging the key challenges identified in the review (semantic consistency, identifiability, computational cost, data pairing)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, motivation, and significance are clearly stated. The methodology is broken down logically into data preparation, OT alignment, fusion, identifiability, and experimental design. The OT formulation and Sinkhorn algorithm are presented. The experimental plan is detailed. Minor ambiguities exist: the exact mechanism by which the transport plan P is used to map features (i.e., \\\\tilde{z}_x = \\\\mathbf{P} z_y) could be more explicit (e.g., clarifying if it implies barycentric mapping). However, the overall structure and language make the proposal largely understandable and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core idea of using Optimal Transport (OT) for cross-modal representation alignment is not entirely new, as evidenced by multiple recent papers cited in the literature review (Refs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10). However, the proposal combines this with a specific focus on seamless merging of pre-trained uni-modal models, proposes a specific cross-attention fusion mechanism, and introduces an explicit identifiability constraint based on the orthogonality of the transport plan (\\\\|\\\\mathbf{P}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{P} - \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\|_F^2). This specific constraint and the integrated approach towards merging pre-trained models offer some originality beyond just applying OT for alignment. The use of synthetic data is a practical addition but less of a core novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has potential weaknesses. Using OT for distribution alignment is theoretically grounded, and cross-attention for fusion is standard. The experimental design is rigorous. However, there are concerns regarding the methodological details: 1) Using the OT plan \\\\mathbf{P} directly as a linear map (\\tilde{z}_x = \\\\mathbf{P} z_y) is unconventional and needs stronger justification or reformulation (e.g., via barycentric maps). 2) The proposed identifiability constraint (\\\\|\\\\mathbf{P}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{P} - \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\|_F^2) applied directly to the coupling matrix \\\\mathbf{P} lacks clear theoretical justification for ensuring the invertibility of the underlying *transformation* derived from OT, especially with entropic regularization where \\\\mathbf{P} is dense. These aspects require further theoretical grounding or empirical validation to be fully convincing."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard datasets (COCO, VQA), pre-trained models (ViT, BERT), and established techniques (OT via Sinkhorn, cross-attention). Libraries for OT (e.g., POT) and deep learning frameworks facilitate implementation. The computational cost of OT is a known challenge but manageable with regularization and standard hardware (GPUs). Synthetic data generation is feasible but adds complexity and potential cost. The main risks involve the potential need for large paired datasets (partially mitigated by synthetic data) and the effectiveness of the proposed identifiability constraint, which might require adjustments during research."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant and timely problem in machine learning: enabling the effective merging and reuse of pre-trained models across different modalities. Success would lead to more efficient development of multimodal systems, reduced computational costs for training, and potentially enhanced performance on tasks requiring cross-modal reasoning. The potential impact spans practical applications (robotics, assistive tech) and theoretical understanding (representation alignment, model interoperability). The problem's importance is underscored by the active research in this area (as shown in the literature review)."
