        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's goal of unifying representations for practical applications like model merging and reuse ('What for'). It elaborates precisely on the research idea, proposing OT for cross-modal alignment and fusion. Furthermore, it situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging the use of OT for alignment (a central theme in the review) and mentioning key concepts like identifiability and multimodal learning, which are highlighted in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The objectives, overall methodology (OT alignment + cross-attention fusion), and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. However, there are minor ambiguities and potential errors. The mathematical formulation for the Optimal Transport dual problem appears incorrect or at least confusingly presented. The term 'adaptive' cross-attention is used without explaining what makes it adaptive beyond standard cross-attention. The specific methods for the 'Identifiability Analysis' are vague, lacking detail on how invertibility and functionality preservation will be assessed."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal has minimal originality. The core idea of using Optimal Transport (OT) for cross-modal representation alignment is heavily represented in the provided literature review, with multiple papers from 2023-2025 cited that employ this exact technique (e.g., papers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10). The proposal does not sufficiently articulate how its specific approach significantly differs from or improves upon these existing methods. While combining OT alignment with cross-attention fusion and identifiability analysis is a complete pipeline, the components themselves are either standard (cross-attention) or already explored (OT alignment). The novelty appears incremental at best."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, leveraging established concepts like OT for distribution alignment and cross-attention for fusion. However, there are weaknesses. A significant issue is the apparent error or confusing presentation in the mathematical formulation of the OT dual problem, which undermines the technical rigor. Additionally, the methodology for the identifiability analysis is underspecified. The assumption that the merged model can perform well on joint tasks with *no* retraining of the fusion layers or aligned encoders might be overly optimistic and lacks strong justification."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It plans to use publicly available datasets. The core techniques (feature extraction from pre-trained models, OT alignment, cross-attention) are implementable with existing libraries and algorithms. While OT can be computationally intensive (a challenge noted in the literature review), efficient approximations exist. Access to pre-trained models and standard ML compute resources should be sufficient. The main risks involve the computational cost and achieving the desired level of performance/semantic consistency without retraining, but the overall plan is practical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem: enabling model merging and reuse across modalities to improve efficiency and performance in multimodal AI. This aligns well with the task description's focus on practical applications. Success would contribute to reducing computational costs and advancing multimodal systems like VQA, robotics, etc. However, given the substantial existing work using OT for alignment (as per the literature review), the *incremental* significance might be moderate unless the proposed method demonstrates clear advantages over prior art, which is not strongly argued in the proposal."
