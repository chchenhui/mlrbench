        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed, including 'Model merging', 'Representational alignment', 'Identifiability in neural models', and 'Multimodal learning'. The core motivation of aligning representations from different modalities (vision, language) to enable model merging and reuse fits perfectly within the workshop's focus on unifying representations, understanding similarities across models/modalities, and exploring practical applications ('What for'). The idea tackles the challenge of incompatible latent spaces, a central problem when trying to unify distinct neural models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with good clarity. The motivation (merging cross-modal models), the proposed method (Optimal Transport for alignment, adaptive cross-attention for fusion), the inclusion of theoretical aspects (identifiability analysis), and the validation strategy (benchmarks) are clearly outlined. The goal of enabling joint tasks without full retraining is well-articulated. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specifics of the adaptive cross-attention mechanism or the exact nature of the identifiability analysis, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While Optimal Transport (OT) is a known technique for distribution alignment and representational alignment has been studied, the specific application of OT to align latent spaces of *pre-trained uni-modal models* post-hoc for *seamless merging* across modalities, combined with adaptive fusion layers and an identifiability constraint, offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond joint training or simple fine-tuning, proposing a structured way to make disparate models compatible. The novelty lies in the specific framework and its goal of direct merging without full retraining, rather than inventing OT itself."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible. Optimal Transport algorithms are available, though computational cost for high-dimensional representations could be a factor. The requirement for paired cross-modal data is met by existing benchmark datasets (e.g., image-text pairs). Training attention mechanisms and accessing pre-trained uni-modal models are standard practices in ML. The identifiability analysis might require theoretical work but is grounded in existing research directions. Implementation seems practical with current ML tools and expertise, assuming standard computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Successfully merging pre-trained models across modalities without costly retraining addresses a critical challenge in multimodal AI and efficient model utilization. It could lead to substantial savings in computational resources, democratize access to powerful multimodal systems by leveraging existing uni-modal models, and accelerate progress in applications requiring cross-modal reasoning (like VQA, robotics, embodied AI). It contributes directly to the practical goals outlined in the task description ('model merging, reuse, knowledge transfer across modalities')."
