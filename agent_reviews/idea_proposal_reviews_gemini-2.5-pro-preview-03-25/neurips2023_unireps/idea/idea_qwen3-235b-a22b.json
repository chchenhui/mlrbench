        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Unifying Representations in Neural Models' by proposing a method (causal disentanglement + cross-model alignment) to achieve this unification. It touches upon key aspects mentioned in the task description, including the 'Why' (causal factors as invariants), 'What for' (model merging, stitching, multimodal settings, robustness), and aligns with listed topics like 'Representational alignment', 'Disentangled representations', 'Model merging, stitching and reuse', and 'Multimodal learning'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main goal, and core components (causal disentanglement, cross-model alignment, contrastive loss) are understandable. However, terms like 'nonlinear ICA-like constraints' and the specific mechanism for inducing a 'universal causal coordinate system' lack precise definition, leaving some ambiguity about the exact technical implementation. Minor refinements could improve precision."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While representational alignment and disentanglement are established fields, the specific proposal to unify representations by enforcing alignment with *causal* factors (rather than just statistical correlations) across different models using a combination of disentanglement techniques and contrastive alignment offers a fresh perspective. The concept of a 'universal causal coordinate system' is ambitious and adds to the novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Causal discovery and disentanglement, especially using 'nonlinear ICA-like constraints' from observational data without strong assumptions, are known to be very difficult problems in machine learning. Ensuring that the identified factors are truly causal and building a 'universal' system across diverse architectures and modalities adds complexity. While components like contrastive learning are standard, the core causal aspect makes the overall feasibility uncertain and likely requires considerable effort and potentially strong assumptions to implement effectively."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully unifying representations based on causal factors would be a major advancement over correlation-based methods, potentially leading to more robust, interpretable, and transferable models. It directly addresses the critical problem outlined in the task description, with potential benefits for model merging, multimodal learning, robustness to domain shifts, and fundamental understanding of learned representations, aligning well with the goals of modular AI and neuroscience-inspired analysis."
