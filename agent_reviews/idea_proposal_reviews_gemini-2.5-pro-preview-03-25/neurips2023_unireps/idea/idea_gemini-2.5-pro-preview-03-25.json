    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses key workshop topics such as 'Model merging', 'Representational alignment', and 'Similarity measures in NNs'. The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on unifying similar representations that emerge in different models trained on similar stimuli/tasks. The proposed method aims to achieve unification ('a single cohesive whole') through functionally aligning representations before merging, fitting squarely into the 'What for' (applications) aspect of the workshop goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, core concept (using OT for layer-wise functional alignment via activations), and proposed workflow (align then average) are clearly explained. The distinction from naive parameter averaging and heuristic methods is highlighted. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific OT cost function, the exact mechanism for applying the OT-derived transformation to parameters (especially if it's more complex than permutation), and how architectural differences between models might be handled, but the overall research direction is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While model merging and representational alignment are established research areas, and OT has been used in other ML contexts, applying OT specifically for layer-wise *functional* alignment (based on activation distributions) as a pre-processing step for parameter averaging in model merging offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond simpler permutation-based alignment methods towards a potentially more principled approach grounded in optimal transport theory to match function spaces before merging parameters. It represents a novel combination and application of existing techniques to this specific problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents potential implementation challenges. Computing Optimal Transport plans can be computationally intensive, especially for high-dimensional activation spaces in deep networks and large datasets. Applying the potentially complex transformations derived from the OT plan to the network parameters (weights and biases) might require non-trivial implementation effort beyond simple permutations. The method likely requires models with comparable architectures or clearly corresponding layers. While standard OT libraries exist, scaling this approach to very large models could be difficult, potentially requiring approximations or efficient solvers. Therefore, it's feasible for research settings but might face hurdles for large-scale practical deployment without further optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Effective model merging is highly valuable for reducing computational costs, improving model robustness and performance, enabling federated learning, and facilitating model reuse. If the proposed OT-based functional alignment method demonstrably outperforms existing merging techniques (like naive averaging or simple permutation matching), it would represent a substantial contribution to the field. It addresses a well-recognized limitation in current model merging approaches and aligns directly with the practical goals outlined in the workshop description."
