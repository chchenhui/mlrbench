    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GAI→ED thrust of the workshop by proposing a novel human-machine collaborative system where the AI acts as a peer. The core concept of a 'Socratic Learning Partner' (SLP) focused on inquiry rather than answers perfectly matches the research idea. The proposal effectively integrates the literature review, positioning the SLP against existing systems like SocratiQ, EduChat, and SPL, and explicitly aims to tackle identified challenges such as simulating authentic Socratic dialogue (Challenge 1) and evaluating pedagogical effectiveness (Challenge 3). The objectives, methodology, and significance sections consistently reinforce the central theme and workshop goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to specific objectives, detailed methodology, and expected impact. The concept of the SLP is clearly distinguished from traditional AI tutors. The methodology section provides specific details on data curation, model selection, algorithmic steps (including prompt examples and the SFT loss function), and a comprehensive evaluation plan with defined conditions, tasks, metrics, and analysis methods. There are minimal ambiguities, making the research plan readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Socratic AI tutors exist (as acknowledged by referencing SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL), the core novelty lies in framing the AI as a 'learning partner' simulating *peer* inquiry dynamics rather than a tutor guiding towards answers. This shift in role – focusing on collaborative questioning, challenging assumptions constructively like a peer, and avoiding direct instruction – represents a fresh perspective within AIED. The emphasis on fine-tuning for this specific peer-like interaction style, rather than general Socratic tutoring, further contributes to the novelty. It's an innovative application of GenAI within the GAI→ED context."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established learning theories (collaborative learning, Socratic method) and leverages standard, appropriate AI techniques (prompt engineering, fine-tuning, potentially RLHF/DPO). The proposed mixed-methods evaluation design is rigorous, employing a control group, a relevant baseline (conventional AI tutor), and multi-faceted metrics (learning gains, interaction analysis, user perception). The inclusion of dialogue analysis to assess the *process* of interaction is crucial. The mathematical formulation shown is correct. Minor weaknesses include the inherent difficulty in perfectly simulating nuanced human interaction and objectively measuring deep cognitive processes, but the proposed methods are appropriate attempts to address these challenges."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Utilizing existing LLMs, standard fine-tuning techniques, and established user study methodologies are practical. Recruiting participants from a university setting is standard. However, challenges exist: curating or generating high-quality fine-tuning data specifically for *peer* Socratic dialogue might be time-consuming and require significant manual effort/review. Achieving consistent peer-like Socratic behavior from the LLM without it reverting to tutoring or providing answers is technically challenging (acknowledged as Challenge 1 in the lit review). The evaluation plan is comprehensive but demanding in terms of implementation and analysis effort. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable within a typical research project timeframe with adequate resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses the GAI→ED workshop theme by exploring a novel role for GenAI beyond tutoring/assistance. If successful, the SLP could provide a scalable method for fostering critical thinking, self-explanation, and metacognitive skills – key goals in education that are often hard to achieve at scale. This research could lead to meaningful advancements in AIED practice. Furthermore, it contributes to AI research by tackling the challenge of controlling LLMs for nuanced pedagogical interactions and potentially producing valuable datasets and fine-tuning insights. The focus on inquiry aligns well with developing deeper understanding and addresses a clear gap identified in the introduction."
