        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GAIâ†’ED thrust of the workshop by proposing a novel human-machine collaborative system (a Socratic peer) using generative AI. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the motivation, methods, and evaluation. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature (SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL), acknowledging prior work while clearly positioning its own contribution to address identified challenges like authentic dialogue simulation and robust evaluation. The objectives and methodology are directly derived from the core idea and the gaps identified in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step plan covering data collection, annotation, model architecture (including technical formulations for losses and RL), deployment, and a comprehensive experimental design. The rationale for choosing a Socratic partner over a standard tutor is clearly articulated, and the expected outcomes and impact are well-explained. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While the concept of Socratic AI tutors exists (as evidenced by SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL in the literature review), this proposal offers novelty in its specific focus on simulating *peer-led* inquiry, its combined methodological approach (multi-task SFT with Socratic move classification + RLHF tuned for question quality), and its rigorous comparative evaluation design focused on critical thinking and metacognition against a direct-feedback baseline. The creation of a specific annotated dataset also adds value. It's not a completely groundbreaking concept, but it offers a fresh perspective and a distinct, well-justified implementation and evaluation strategy compared to existing work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in established pedagogical theories (Socratic method, collaborative inquiry) and utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques (LLM fine-tuning, multi-task learning, RLHF with PPO). The methodology is detailed and robust, including a clear data annotation plan with quality control (IAA), well-defined model training procedures with correct technical formulations, and a rigorous experimental design (RCT, appropriate measures like MAI and transcript analysis, sound statistical analysis plan using ANCOVA/mixed-effects models). The choices made are well-justified and align with best practices in both educational technology and AI research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Using a publicly available LLM like LLaMA-2 13B is practical. The proposed ML techniques (SFT, RLHF) are standard, albeit computationally intensive. The experimental design involving 120 participants is ambitious but standard for user studies in this field. The main potential challenges lie in acquiring the ~5,000 high-quality Socratic dialogue transcripts (requiring access and potentially significant cleaning/selection) and the labor involved in annotation and qualitative coding of study data. However, these challenges are common in such research and seem manageable with adequate resources and planning. No fundamental technological barriers exist."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current AI tutors, which often prioritize answer provision over fostering deeper learning processes like critical thinking and metacognition. Developing an AI partner that effectively facilitates Socratic inquiry could lead to major advancements in personalized learning and educational technology. The expected outcomes include not only a valuable educational tool but also contributions to AI research (methods for aligning LLMs with pedagogical goals, benchmark dataset) and potentially influencing policy regarding the use of AI in education towards promoting higher-order thinking. The project aligns perfectly with the goals of advancing educational AI."
