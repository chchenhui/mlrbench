    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GAIED workshop's GAI→ED thrust by proposing a novel human-machine collaborative system (AI as a peer/partner). It faithfully expands on the research idea, focusing on the Socratic method for collaborative inquiry rather than just tutoring. Furthermore, it acknowledges and positions itself relative to the cited literature (SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL, EducationQ), aiming to build upon existing work while addressing identified challenges like simulating authentic dialogue and evaluation."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology (mixed-methods, algorithmic steps, experimental design), and expected outcomes are articulated logically. The distinction between a Socratic learning partner and a conventional AI tutor is highlighted. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the specific nature of the 'curated educational dialogues', the precise fine-tuning strategy, and the detailed structure of the evaluation rubrics, but the overall research plan is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates satisfactory novelty. While using AI for Socratic interaction is not entirely new (as evidenced by the literature review citing SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL), the specific framing of the AI as a 'learning partner' simulating 'peer interactions' for 'collaborative inquiry' offers a nuanced distinction from typical AI tutor approaches. The emphasis on prompting explanations and challenging assumptions *instead* of providing answers differentiates it. However, it builds significantly on existing concepts rather than introducing a fundamentally groundbreaking method."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous. It employs a suitable mixed-methods approach with a control group comparison, which is standard for educational technology evaluation. The use of LLMs, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning are established techniques. The evaluation metrics target relevant aspects (explanation quality, reflection, satisfaction). However, the proposal lacks specific details regarding the data curation process, the fine-tuning methodology, the precise definition of the 'conventional AI tutor' baseline, and the specific criteria within the evaluation rubrics, which slightly limits the assessment of its full rigor at this stage."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing LLM technology and standard techniques like prompt engineering and fine-tuning. The required resources (LLM access, data curation effort, participant recruitment) are typical for AI education research. The outlined steps are logical. Key challenges, such as achieving authentic Socratic peer dialogue and robust evaluation, are acknowledged implicitly through the literature review and methodology, but the overall plan appears realistic and implementable within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a critical gap in AI tutoring systems – the development of critical thinking and metacognitive skills through inquiry, rather than just knowledge delivery. By exploring AI as a collaborative partner, it aligns directly with the GAIED workshop's goals. Successful execution could lead to valuable insights for designing more effective AI-based learning tools and contribute meaningfully to the field of AI in education, potentially influencing future educational practices."
