        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the GAIED workshop's task description. It directly addresses the GAI→ED thrust by proposing a novel application of generative AI (LLMs) to enhance educational technology (personalized tutors). It aims to improve state-of-the-art EdTech by incorporating affective feedback, a key aspect of personalized learning often overlooked. Furthermore, it acknowledges the ED→GAI thrust by explicitly mentioning the need to address risks like privacy and ethical design through transparent, opt-in protocols. The proposal fits well within the workshop's scope, particularly concerning novel human-machine collaborative systems (digital tutors) and exploring GenAI capabilities for personalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly articulates the problem (lack of affective consideration in GenAI tutors). The main idea is broken down into three understandable steps: multimodal affect inference, LLM adaptation via prompting/fine-tuning, and validation through user studies. The specific technologies mentioned (multimodal transformers, LLMs) and the proposed workflow are concrete. The expected outcomes and connection to the workshop's themes are explicitly stated, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While AI tutors, affective computing in education, and using LLMs for education exist separately, the proposed integration of real-time, multimodal affective feedback to dynamically adapt generative AI tutors via prompting or fine-tuning is innovative. It moves beyond static personalization or simple rule-based affective responses. The combination of cutting-edge multimodal perception (ViTs, audio encoders) with dynamic LLM adaptation based on inferred emotional states presents a fresh approach within the AI tutor landscape."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Real-time multimodal affect recognition is technically complex and achieving high accuracy consistently across diverse users and contexts is difficult. Integrating the perception module with the LLM adaptation mechanism in real-time requires careful system engineering to manage latency. Data acquisition (video, audio) raises significant privacy concerns and logistical hurdles, although the proposal acknowledges this with opt-in protocols. User studies are standard but require careful ethical considerations and recruitment. While challenging, the core components rely on existing, albeit advanced, technologies, making it feasible within a research context, particularly for controlled lab studies initially."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the emotional and motivational aspects of learning is crucial for student success, and current GenAI tutors largely neglect this. Developing AI tutors that can perceive and appropriately respond to student affect could lead to major advancements in personalized learning, potentially improving engagement, reducing frustration, and enhancing learning outcomes. Success in this area would represent a substantial step towards more human-like, empathetic, and effective educational AI. Furthermore, tackling the associated ethical challenges contributes to the responsible development of AI in education."
