        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the GAIED workshop's task description. It directly addresses the 'GAI→ED' thrust by proposing a novel human-machine collaborative system where an LLM acts as a sophisticated digital tutor, exploring new capabilities for personalized learning. It also touches upon the 'ED→GAI' thrust by explicitly mentioning the development of safeguards to prevent misuse (e.g., completing assignments) and addressing concerns about AI replacing critical thinking, which aligns with identifying and tackling challenges posed by generative AI in education. The focus on Socratic methods and adaptive dialogue fits perfectly within the scope of exploring novel educational scenarios and enhancing educational technology using generative AI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation is explicitly stated, contrasting current limitations with the proposed solution. The main idea is detailed, outlining the multi-layered dialogue strategy, the specific modes (questioning, scaffolding, etc.), the pedagogical principles (productive struggle, withholding answers), the transparency layer, the methodology (fine-tuning, evaluation metrics), and the safeguards. The concepts are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While AI tutors and using LLMs for education are existing areas, the proposed approach incorporates several innovative elements. The specific multi-layered Socratic dialogue model with dynamic shifting between five distinct pedagogical modes (questioning, scaffolding, challenging, reflecting, synthesizing) based on real-time assessment is a novel contribution. Furthermore, the deliberate inclusion of 'productive struggle', 'strategic silence', withholding direct answers, and the 'transparent pedagogy layer' differentiates it significantly from typical AI tutors that often prioritize immediate assistance. Developing specialized fine-tuning datasets from expert dialogues and creating evaluation metrics beyond factual accuracy also add to its novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant research and implementation challenges. Building and fine-tuning LLMs for dialogue is achievable. However, creating high-quality, specialized fine-tuning datasets reflecting nuanced Socratic dialogues requires substantial effort and pedagogical expertise. Developing a robust real-time assessment mechanism to accurately gauge student understanding and trigger appropriate dialogue mode shifts is a complex technical challenge. Designing and validating effective evaluation metrics for 'learning quality' and critical thinking is non-trivial. While feasible within a dedicated research project, these aspects require considerable resources and innovation, making implementation demanding."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical need in AI-driven education: moving beyond simple information delivery or task completion towards fostering deeper understanding and critical thinking, grounded in established pedagogical theory (Socratic method). Successfully implementing such a system could lead to major advancements in personalized learning technology, offering scalable, adaptive, and pedagogically sound tutoring. The focus on transparency and safeguards also addresses pressing concerns about the responsible use of AI in education. The potential impact on improving learning outcomes and shaping future AI tutor design is substantial."
