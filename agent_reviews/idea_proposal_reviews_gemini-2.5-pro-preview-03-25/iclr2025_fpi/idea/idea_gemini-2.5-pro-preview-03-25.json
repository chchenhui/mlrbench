        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (FPI workshop call). It directly addresses the workshop's core focus on sampling from unnormalized distributions, particularly 'sampling from generative models (diffusion model and LLMs) weighted by target density' for 'inference-time alignment' and 'Bayesian posterior inference'. The proposed method uses a learning-based approach (amortized guidance network) to modify sampling (diffusion model scores), fitting the 'Learning meets Sampling' theme. It targets challenges like costly retraining or slow inference, which are relevant discussion points for the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of existing methods), the core proposal (amortized guidance network modifying diffusion scores), the target problem (sampling from p(x)w(x)/Z), the proposed mechanism (approximating score perturbation), the training strategy (offline), and the intended benefits (speed, quality, no retraining). The concepts are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity, making the research direction immediately understandable."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While score guidance in diffusion models exists (e.g., classifier guidance, CFG), the specific proposal of learning a separate, lightweight, *amortized* guidance network to approximate the effect of a general weighting function `w(x)` on the score, trained offline and plugged in at inference, appears innovative. It differs from standard guidance methods that often require online computation related to `w(x)` or specific training procedures for the base model (like CFG). This amortization approach for general score perturbation offers a fresh perspective on efficient guided sampling."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology. It leverages existing pre-trained diffusion models. Training a lightweight guidance network is computationally much cheaper than training the base model. Integrating such a network into the diffusion sampling loop is standard practice. The main potential challenge lies in designing effective training objectives and potentially requiring representative data for the guidance network to generalize well to the effects of `w(x)`, but the proposed strategies (using examples or related objectives like EBMs) are plausible starting points. No fundamental roadblocks are apparent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical challenges in probabilistic inference and generative modeling: efficiently sampling from complex, high-dimensional distributions, particularly weighted ones. Success would provide a valuable tool for Bayesian inference (posterior sampling) and controlling generative models at inference time (e.g., for safety alignment, style transfer) without costly fine-tuning or slow iterative methods. This could enable broader application of these techniques where computational resources or inference speed are constraints, representing a potentially major advancement."
