    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FPI workshop's theme of sampling from unnormalized distributions (target density \\\\pi(x)) and its application to LLM inference-time alignment, a specific topic mentioned in the call for Research Papers. The methodology faithfully implements the core research idea of using a diffusion-inspired sampler with reward guidance. It situates itself correctly within the provided literature, acknowledging related approaches (classifier guidance, SMC) and aiming to improve upon existing methods by proposing a token-level diffusion approach (DIA), distinguishing it from sentence-level (DiffPO) or alternative guidance methods (Demon). It also touches upon theoretical aspects and connections to optimal control (Langevin dynamics), fitting the workshop's broader interests."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and outlines the proposed solution (DIA) and objectives. The methodology section systematically breaks down the approach: problem formulation, continuous embedding, DDPM training, the core reward-guided reverse process equation, the reward surrogate strategy, and an algorithm summary. The experimental design is detailed. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the specifics of learning/setting diffusion schedules or the precise handling of the discretization step G(z) beyond the surrogate critic, but the overall concept and plan are readily understandable. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a new way for LLM alignment. While diffusion models for text and inference-time alignment techniques exist separately, the specific proposal of using a token-level diffusion process operating on continuous embeddings, guided by Langevin-style updates derived from a target density (potentially using a learned surrogate reward function), appears novel. It distinguishes itself from sentence-level approaches (DiffPO) and methods avoiding reward gradients (Demon) cited in the literature review. The innovation lies in this specific synthesis (DIA framework) rather than inventing a fundamentally new mechanism, but it offers a fresh perspective on inference-time control."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations: diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), score-based generation, and Langevin dynamics for sampling. The formulation of the target density \\\\pi(x) is standard. The proposed guided reverse process correctly incorporates terms related to the diffusion model's score and the reward gradient, drawing a plausible connection to Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). Using a learned surrogate critic h_\\\\phi to estimate gradients for potentially non-differentiable rewards is a sound and practical approach. The brief theoretical analysis correctly points to relevant convergence results under standard assumptions, acknowledging potential discretization bias. The methodology appears technically coherent."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and standard ML resources. Training DDPMs on embeddings and reward critics is achievable, though potentially computationally intensive. The base LLM (GPT-2 small) is accessible. The experimental plan is well-structured. However, challenges exist: diffusion models can be slow at inference due to the iterative sampling (T_{\\\\max} steps), which might impact the practicality for 'real-time' alignment. Achieving high-quality generation and stable guidance might require significant tuning of schedules (\\\\{\\\\alpha_t, \\\\sigma_t, \\\\eta_t\\\\}) and careful training of the DDPM (\\epsilon_\\\\psi) and critic (h_\\\\phi). The 9-month timeline seems ambitious but plausible for focused research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in contemporary AI: the safe, controllable, and efficient alignment of LLMs. Current methods like RLHF have substantial drawbacks (cost, complexity, stability). An effective inference-time alignment method like DIA, which avoids retraining the base LLM, would be a major contribution. It could enable cheaper, faster, and more flexible customization and control of LLMs, impacting safety, style adaptation, factuality, and user-specific applications. Success would represent a substantial advancement in the field and is highly relevant to the FPI workshop's focus on impactful applications of sampling methods."
