    "Consistency": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the task description, targeting the workshop's focus on sampling from generative models (LLMs) weighted by a target density for inference-time alignment. It directly expands on the provided research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. It also references the literature review by including DiffPO as a baseline. However, it fails to adequately differentiate itself from highly similar, recent work mentioned in the literature review (particularly paper #9, which appears identical in title and summary, and paper #1, DiffPO). This lack of clear distinction from prior work introduces a minor inconsistency regarding its positioning within the current research landscape as presented."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal's objectives, significance, and overall goal are clearly stated. However, the methodology section lacks sufficient detail and contains ambiguities. Specifically, the description of the diffusion process (steps 4.3 and 4.4) seems potentially confused regarding standard forward/reverse diffusion steps. How the continuous-space mathematical formulation applies to discrete token-level generation is not explained. Furthermore, the role and training/updating mechanism of the transition kernel 'phi' (whether it's pre-trained or updated online during inference) is unclear, which is crucial for understanding the method's dynamics and efficiency. The data section is also vague, listing model types instead of specific datasets."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The proposal's novelty is significantly questionable based on the provided literature review. Paper #9 (arXiv:2301.12345) shares the exact same title and abstract summary, suggesting the proposed work might already exist or be heavily derivative. Additionally, other recent papers like DiffPO (paper #1, 2025), Training-free Diffusion Model Alignment (paper #2, 2024), and Test-time Alignment (paper #3, 2025) explore very similar concepts of inference-time alignment for diffusion/generative models using reward guidance or related sampling techniques. The proposal does not articulate a clear, unique contribution or differentiate its specific approach sufficiently from these existing methods. The 'key innovations' mentioned in the idea description are not substantiated with details in the proposal to establish their novelty against the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is based on generally sound concepts like diffusion models, reward-guided generation, and gradient-based optimization (akin to Langevin dynamics). However, the technical soundness of the proposed methodology as described is questionable. The description of the diffusion steps appears inconsistent with standard formulations. The application of continuous diffusion mathematics to discrete text data without explanation (e.g., via embeddings and how the process operates in that space) is a gap. The mechanism and timing for training/updating the transition kernel 'phi' lack rigorous definition, making it hard to assess the stability and correctness of the learning process. While the high-level concepts are valid, the specific algorithmic description lacks rigor and contains potential technical flaws."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research is potentially feasible given access to standard ML resources (pre-trained LLMs, compute for training reward models/transition kernels, running inference). However, significant challenges exist. The iterative nature of diffusion sampling, especially when combined with reward gradient computations and potentially online updates to the transition kernel during inference, could be computationally very expensive. This raises concerns about the primary claim of improved 'efficiency' over fine-tuning methods. Implementing token-level diffusion effectively and ensuring the stability of the guided sampling process are non-trivial technical hurdles. The proposal acknowledges efficiency as a goal but doesn't sufficiently detail how the inherent costs of the iterative process will be managed to outperform baselines."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and relevant problem: the efficient and flexible alignment of LLMs with human preferences or constraints. Developing effective inference-time alignment methods would be a valuable contribution, potentially enabling more dynamic and personalized LLM interactions without costly retraining cycles. The research direction aligns perfectly with the workshop's themes. If successful in demonstrating genuine improvements in efficiency, control, and scalability over existing methods (like RLHF and DiffPO), the work could have a considerable impact. However, the potential impact is moderated by the concerns regarding novelty and the feasibility of achieving the claimed efficiency."
