    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses two key topics listed: 'Data Attribution, Interpretability, and Data Marketplaces' (by proposing efficient attribution techniques, aiming for fair compensation via marketplaces) and 'Legal and Technical Solutions for Data Copyright Protection' (by offering a framework to address copyright concerns). The motivation and proposed solution focus squarely on data problems in foundation models, which is the central theme of the workshop."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is compelling, and the main components of the proposed framework (combined techniques, layered attribution, confidence scoring, tooling, API) are outlined. The goals are well-defined. However, some technical details remain high-level (e.g., the specific modifications to influence functions for scale, the exact nature of the 'dataset-based techniques', how 'minimal computational overhead' will be achieved). Minor refinements clarifying these technical aspects would enhance precision."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While data attribution and influence functions are existing concepts, the proposal to combine model-based (specifically, influence functions modified for FM scale) and dataset-based techniques into a single comprehensive framework is a fresh approach. The concept of a layered attribution system (exact, stylistic, conceptual) adds further novelty, as does the focus on practical tooling and APIs integrated into the framework. It builds upon existing work but offers a novel synthesis and application tailored to FMs."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea faces significant feasibility challenges. Applying influence functions to foundation models is known to be computationally extremely expensive. The claim of achieving this with 'minimal computational overhead' requires substantial innovation and justification, bordering on optimistic. Accurately and reliably implementing 'stylistic influence' and 'conceptual attribution' is technically very difficult and may lack objective grounding. While the tooling/API aspect is feasible from an engineering standpoint, the core attribution methods' scalability and reliability at the FM scale are major hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Data attribution, fair compensation for creators, and copyright protection are critical unresolved issues in the development and deployment of foundation models. A successful framework addressing these problems could lead to major advancements in AI ethics, legal compliance, and the sustainability of the AI ecosystem by fostering trust and enabling functional data marketplaces. It tackles a core problem highlighted by the workshop."
