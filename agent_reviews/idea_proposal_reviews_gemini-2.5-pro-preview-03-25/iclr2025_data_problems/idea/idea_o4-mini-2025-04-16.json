        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of 'Data Collection and Curation for Foundation Models', specifically proposing a practical strategy for curating multi-modal data tailored to FM training. It tackles challenges mentioned in the call, such as scale and multimodality, and aims to improve fairness, which aligns with the 'Data and Society' topic. The focus on principled, scalable curation methods for large, heterogeneous datasets is exactly what the workshop encourages."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem of curating large multi-modal datasets. The main idea presents a logical two-stage pipeline (clustering, influence scoring) with specific techniques mentioned (cross-modal embeddings, low-rank Hessian approximations, mini-batch gradients). The goals (pruning, up-weighting) and evaluation plan (benchmarks, metrics) are explicitly stated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While influence functions and data clustering are existing concepts, the proposed combination and application are innovative. Specifically, applying amortized influence scores hierarchically at the cluster level, using cross-modal embeddings for clustering, and targeting large-scale multi-modal foundation models represents a fresh approach. The use of low-rank Hessian approximations for scalability in this specific curation context further adds to the novelty. It's a clever synthesis and extension of existing ideas for a challenging new domain."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Clustering using pre-trained embeddings is standard. The core challenge lies in the scalable computation of amortized influence scores using low-rank Hessian approximations. While these techniques are designed to make influence computation more tractable, implementing them efficiently for foundation model scale requires significant engineering effort and computational resources. The iterative nature adds complexity. However, the proposal explicitly considers scalability, making it plausible, albeit demanding."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and increasingly relevant problem of data curation for large-scale multi-modal foundation models. Effective curation directly impacts training cost, efficiency, model performance, robustness, and fairness. Developing a principled, scalable method like 'InfluenceSpace' could lead to major advancements in how foundation models are developed and trained, offering substantial benefits over current heuristic approaches. Its success would have a broad impact on the field."
