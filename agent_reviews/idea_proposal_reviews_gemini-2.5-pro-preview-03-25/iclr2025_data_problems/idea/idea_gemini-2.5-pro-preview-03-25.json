        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (DATA-FM workshop). It directly addresses the core theme of 'Data Collection and Curation for Foundation Models' by focusing on practical strategies (auditing curation steps) and explicitly targets 'Data and Society (Safety, Privacy, Fairness, and Other Social Impacts)' by aiming to improve fairness through data-centric approaches and addressing the side effects of data curation. The proposed framework also relates to 'Benchmarks and Evaluations' by suggesting quantitative metrics. It fits squarely within the workshop's goals of understanding and addressing data challenges in FMs."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (opacity of fairness impacts in data curation), the main proposal (a modular auditing framework), its inputs (curation operations, data samples), outputs (quantitative fairness metrics for subgroups), and the overall goal (informed, fairness-aware curation) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. Minor details regarding the specific metrics or implementation nuances are understandably omitted at the proposal stage but do not hinder the comprehension of the core concept."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While fairness auditing in ML is not new, the specific focus on creating a *modular framework* to systematically audit the fairness implications of *individual stages* within *FM data curation pipelines* is innovative. Most work focuses on dataset-level or model-level fairness, whereas this proposes dissecting the pipeline itself. It offers a fresh perspective on tackling bias at its source during data preparation for large-scale models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing methods but presents moderate research challenges. Building modules for specific curation operations (filtering, mixing) and calculating representation metrics is practical. Defining appropriate subgroups and robust downstream task proxies without full model retraining requires careful design. Scaling the analysis to massive FM datasets could pose computational hurdles, potentially requiring efficient sampling or approximation techniques. However, these challenges seem surmountable through research and development, making the core idea implementable, especially for initial proof-of-concept."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Fairness in FMs is a critical concern, and data curation is a known, yet often opaque, source of bias. Providing a systematic framework to audit and understand these effects addresses a crucial gap. Such a tool could enable developers to build fairer FMs, increase transparency in the development process, and contribute substantially to responsible AI practices. Its potential impact on both research and industry practice is high."
