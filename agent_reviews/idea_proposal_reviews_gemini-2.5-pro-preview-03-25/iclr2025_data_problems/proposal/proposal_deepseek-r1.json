    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data curation challenges for multi-modal foundation models, including scalability, fairness, and evaluation. The methodology clearly operationalizes the core research idea of hierarchical, influence-driven curation. Furthermore, it effectively integrates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as leveraging efficient influence estimation ideas (DataInf), aiming for fairness (Chameleon), using appropriate multi-modal models (FLAVA), and considering holistic evaluation (HEMM)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology (broken down into embedding, clustering, influence estimation, and pruning/reweighting), and experimental plan are articulated logically. The use of equations and references to specific techniques (Nyström, Davies-Bouldin) adds precision. Minor areas could benefit from refinement, such as the exact modality fusion mechanism (beyond concatenation/pooling) or the specific formulation of the fairness-aware reweighting scheme. However, the overall concept and approach are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While influence functions and clustering are established techniques, the core contribution lies in their specific combination and application: a hierarchical, *cluster-level* amortized influence estimation framework tailored for *multi-modal* data curation to enhance scalability. This contrasts with prior work like DataInf (per-sample influence) and standard heuristic curation. The iterative pruning and reweighting based on cluster influence further adds to the originality. It's a novel synthesis and application rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid theoretical foundations (influence functions, clustering algorithms) and employs recognized techniques for scalability (Hessian approximation via Nyström decomposition, mini-batch sampling). The methodology follows a logical progression. Using pre-trained embeddings (FLAVA) and standard clustering metrics (Davies-Bouldin) is appropriate. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics for evaluation. The main assumption needing empirical validation is the effectiveness of cluster-level influence as a proxy for aggregate sample influence within that cluster, but the plan includes evaluating this."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents computational challenges. It relies on existing technologies (PyTorch, FAISS, pre-trained models) and publicly available datasets. However, computing embeddings, performing large-scale clustering, and estimating influence (even amortized approximations of Hessians) for foundation model scale data will be computationally intensive, requiring significant resources. The iterative nature adds complexity. Success depends on the efficiency of the approximations and the availability of adequate compute infrastructure. The plan is realistic, but resource constraints and tuning complexity pose manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It tackles a critical bottleneck in the development of large-scale multi-modal foundation models: efficient and effective data curation. Addressing data volume, quality, bias, and computational cost is crucial for the field. If successful, InfluenceSpace could provide a scalable, principled method leading to more efficient training, improved model performance, and enhanced fairness, representing a substantial contribution to data-centric AI and multi-modal learning. The potential impact on resource usage and model trustworthiness is considerable."
