        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (DATA-FM workshop call), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses key workshop themes like data curation for FMs, multi-modal settings, efficiency, fairness, and evaluation benchmarks. The methodology section thoroughly expands on the core research idea, detailing the proposed two-stage pipeline. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning the work relative to influence function estimation (Kwon et al.), multi-modal models (FLAVA), evaluation (HEMM), and fairness (Chameleon), while explicitly tackling challenges identified in the review, such as computational efficiency and data bias in multi-modal contexts."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the stage effectively, motivating the problem and outlining the proposed solution. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step description of the InfluenceSpace framework, including data processing, embedding, clustering, influence computation, and iterative curation. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are also clearly specified. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise method for low-rank Hessian approximation or the selection criteria for the validation set used in influence computation, but overall the proposal is well-articulated and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While influence functions and multi-modal embeddings are existing concepts, their combined application to hierarchical, cluster-based data curation for large-scale multi-modal foundation models is novel. The specific contributions include: 1) Extending influence-driven curation to the multi-modal domain at scale. 2) Proposing a hierarchical clustering approach combined with influence functions for computational tractability. 3) Incorporating explicit fairness adjustments based on cluster influence and metadata. This represents a significant step beyond heuristic methods and single-modality influence studies, offering a fresh perspective on data-centric AI for multi-modal FMs."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical foundations (influence functions, multi-modal representation learning, clustering) and cites relevant prior work. The proposed methodology, involving hierarchical clustering and approximated influence functions (low-rank Hessian, mini-batching), is a reasonable approach to tackle the scalability challenge. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse benchmarks (performance, fairness, efficiency), and ablation studies. The technical formulations appear correct, although the reliance on approximations introduces potential trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, which the proposal acknowledges implicitly through evaluation and ablation studies. The justification for specific choices (e.g., embedding weighting parameter alpha, clustering thresholds) being 'empirically determined' is acceptable but highlights areas requiring careful tuning."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant computational challenges. Implementing the framework requires access to substantial compute resources for processing large datasets (CC12M, LAION subset), training proxy models, and computing influence functions, even with the proposed approximations. The hierarchical clustering and low-rank approximations are crucial for feasibility, but their implementation and tuning require expertise. Data access is feasible as standard datasets are proposed. The overall plan is ambitious but technically plausible with adequate resources and engineering effort. The iterative refinement loop adds complexity that might affect convergence and overall runtime."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and timely challenges in the development of multi-modal foundation models: the need for efficient, effective, and fair data curation methods to manage massive datasets and reduce computational/environmental costs. Success would lead to major advancements by providing a principled alternative to ad-hoc heuristics, potentially enabling the development of better-performing, more efficient, and less biased multi-modal FMs. The potential impact spans improved model development practices, resource democratization, enhanced fairness, and contributions to data-centric AI research."
