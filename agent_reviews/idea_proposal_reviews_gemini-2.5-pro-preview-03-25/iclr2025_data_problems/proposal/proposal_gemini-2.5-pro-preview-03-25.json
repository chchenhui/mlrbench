    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the DATA-FM workshop call (data curation for FMs, scalability, multi-modality, fairness, benchmarks). The proposed 'InfluenceSpace' method is precisely the one described in the research idea. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the concepts presented in the literature review, citing relevant works on influence functions (DataInf), multi-modal models (FLAVA), evaluation (HEMM), and fairness (Chameleon) to motivate the approach and acknowledge related challenges. There are no discernible inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, research idea (InfluenceSpace), objectives, and significance are articulated concisely and logically. The methodology section provides substantial detail, including the algorithmic steps for clustering, the mathematical formulation for amortized cluster influence estimation (clearly explaining the approximations involved), and a comprehensive experimental design with specific datasets, models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The structure is easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the proposed work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While influence functions and clustering are established techniques, applying them hierarchically (cluster-level influence) specifically for curating massive *multi-modal* pre-training datasets is a novel approach. It distinguishes itself from prior work like DataInf (point-wise influence, often for fine-tuning) by tackling the scalability challenge of pre-training data through cluster-level analysis and amortization. The combination of cross-modal clustering, scalable influence approximation for clusters, and targeted curation (pruning/up-weighting) for performance and fairness in this context represents a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon strong theoretical foundations (influence functions by Koh & Liang) and leverages established techniques (multi-modal embeddings, clustering, Hessian approximations like FIM/low-rank). The adaptation of influence functions to the cluster level is an approximation, but it is well-justified by the need for scalability, and the proposed method (using mini-batch gradients and Hessian approximations) is plausible. The technical formulations are presented clearly and appear correct. The experimental design is rigorous, including baselines, ablation studies, and multi-faceted evaluation (performance, efficiency, fairness)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical and computational challenges. Implementing efficient Hessian approximations (e.g., KFAC-like or low-rank) and integrating them into the training and curation loop is complex. The computational cost for embedding, clustering, and repeatedly calculating gradients/influence scores, even with approximations and on subsets (10M-100M scale as proposed), will be substantial, requiring significant GPU resources. However, the plan uses existing datasets and model architectures, and the proposed approximations are designed to make it tractable within a well-resourced research environment. The risks associated with the accuracy of approximations and tuning complexity are acknowledged implicitly."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the development of large-scale multi-modal foundation models: efficient and effective data curation. Success would lead to substantial reductions in training costs (computation, time, energy), potentially democratizing FM development. Furthermore, by providing a principled way to improve data quality and potentially mitigate bias through targeted curation, it could lead to more robust, reliable, and fairer AI models. This directly aligns with the goals of the DATA-FM workshop and addresses pressing needs in the broader ML community."
