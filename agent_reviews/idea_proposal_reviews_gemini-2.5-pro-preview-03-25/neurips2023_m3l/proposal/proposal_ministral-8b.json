    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for bridging deep learning theory and practice, focusing on optimization beyond stable regimes (EoS), continuous approximations (SDEs), and adaptive algorithms for large models. The proposal meticulously follows the research idea, expanding on its motivation and main concepts. It also effectively incorporates the cited literature, positioning the research within the current understanding of EoS and SDEs, and explicitly aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, outlining the background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes logically. The core concepts (EoS, SDEs, adaptive optimization) are introduced adequately. However, crucial details regarding the proposed adaptive optimization algorithm are lacking. Specifically, the mechanism for dynamically adjusting learning rates and noise schedules based on curvature estimates is not elaborated upon, nor are the specific 'low-cost Hessian approximation' techniques mentioned. This ambiguity slightly hinders a complete understanding of the core technical contribution."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While building on existing work on EoS observation (Cohen et al.), EoS analysis (Arora et al.), and continuous-time SGD (Wang & Sirignano, Lugosi & Nualart), it proposes a novel synthesis. The core novelty lies in using insights from SDE approximations of gradient dynamics specifically to design an *adaptive* optimization algorithm that actively targets and maintains the EoS regime by dynamically adjusting learning rate and noise based on curvature estimates. This control-oriented approach to leveraging EoS appears distinct from prior work that primarily focused on observing or analyzing the phenomenon."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, grounding itself in relevant concepts like SDE approximations and Hessian-based stability analysis (EoS condition). However, it lacks rigor in key areas. The validity conditions for the SDE approximation in the context of deep learning optimization are not discussed. More importantly, the theoretical justification for the proposed adaptive control mechanism (how curvature estimates will reliably guide LR/noise adjustments to maintain EoS without divergence) is missing. The reliance on unspecified 'low-cost Hessian approximations' without discussing their accuracy or limitations in the EoS context also weakens the technical soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant challenges. While individual components like SDE analysis, Hessian approximation techniques, and implementing adaptive optimizers are known, reliably controlling training dynamics at the edge of instability is inherently difficult. Implementing and evaluating low-cost Hessian approximations accurately and efficiently at scale remains a research challenge. Training large models requires substantial computational resources. The ambitious goal of achieving 2-3x speedups depends heavily on the effectiveness and low overhead of the proposed method, which is uncertain. There's a considerable risk that the adaptive mechanism could be unstable or its overhead could negate performance gains."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in modern machine learning: the inefficient and poorly understood training dynamics of large-scale models, particularly concerning the Edge of Stability. Developing a theoretically grounded method to harness EoS for faster and more stable training could lead to substantial reductions in computational cost, energy consumption, and time for training foundation models. It directly tackles the theory-practice gap highlighted in the task description and has the potential for major impact on both theoretical understanding and practical deep learning workflows."
