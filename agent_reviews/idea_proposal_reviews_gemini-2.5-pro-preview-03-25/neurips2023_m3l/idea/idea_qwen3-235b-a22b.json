        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for contributions that reconcile optimization theory with deep learning practice, specifically mentioning the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon, the role of large learning rates and noise, and the use of continuous approximations (like SDEs) to understand discrete dynamics. The idea directly addresses these points by proposing to study EoS using SDEs and designing an adaptive algorithm to leverage these dynamics for faster training of large models, thus bridging theory and practice as requested."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (understanding EoS for large models), the core approach (hybrid theoretical-empirical using SDEs, analyzing dynamics, designing an adaptive optimizer with curvature info), and the expected outcomes (theoretical insights, practical algorithm, speedups). The connection between the theoretical analysis and the proposed algorithm is logical and easy to follow. Minor details about the specific SDE formulation or Hessian approximation method are understandably omitted in a summary but the overall concept is unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While EoS is a known phenomenon and SDEs are used to study optimization, the proposal to use dynamical systems insights derived from SDEs to *actively design* an adaptive optimization algorithm that *intentionally operates* at the EoS boundary by dynamically adjusting learning rates and noise schedules is innovative. It moves beyond merely explaining EoS towards harnessing it algorithmically, incorporating curvature information specifically for this purpose. This combination offers a fresh perspective compared to standard optimizer design or purely observational EoS studies."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant research challenges. The theoretical analysis using SDEs and numerical simulations is standard, albeit potentially complex. Implementing and testing on large-scale models requires substantial computational resources, which is common but still a constraint. The main challenge lies in designing a *robust* adaptive algorithm that reliably stays near the EoS boundary without diverging across different model architectures and datasets. Ensuring stability while pushing performance limits is inherently difficult. Using 'low-cost Hessian approximations' is feasible, but their effective integration into the EoS control mechanism needs careful design and validation. Achieving a consistent 2-3x speedup is ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding and controlling optimization dynamics at the Edge of Stability is a critical open problem in deep learning, particularly relevant for training massive foundation models where trial-and-error tuning is prohibitively expensive. Developing a theoretically grounded optimization strategy that accelerates training (e.g., by 2-3x) for such models would represent a major practical advancement, saving considerable computational resources, energy, and time. Furthermore, providing deeper theoretical insights into why modern optimizers work bridges a crucial gap identified in the task description."
