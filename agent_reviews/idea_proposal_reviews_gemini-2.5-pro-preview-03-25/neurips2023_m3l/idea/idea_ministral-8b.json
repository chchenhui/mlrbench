        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns perfectly with the task description. The task explicitly solicits contributions on 'Continuous approximations of training trajectories' (e.g., gradient flow or SDE) under the topic 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice'. The idea directly proposes investigating exactly this, aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practice for deep learning optimization, which is the central theme of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (gap between theory/practice, cost of large models), the main concept (approximating discrete dynamics with continuous models), the methodology (develop, validate, analyze), and the expected outcomes/impact are all clearly articulated and easy to understand. There are no significant ambiguities, making the research direction very well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The use of continuous approximations like gradient flow and SDEs to study optimization dynamics is an established theoretical tool. However, the novelty lies in applying these tools specifically to understand modern deep learning phenomena (like Edge of Stability, large learning rates, gradient noise effects in large models) and emphasizing empirical validation against actual training trajectories to derive practical guidelines. It's more of a novel application and rigorous validation of existing concepts in a highly relevant modern context, rather than a completely new theoretical paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Developing and analyzing continuous approximations requires strong mathematical expertise, which is standard for theoretical ML research. The main challenge lies in the empirical validation step, which requires significant computational resources to train deep learning models (potentially large ones) and compare trajectories. While computationally intensive, it is achievable with appropriate resources. The theoretical analysis part is challenging but standard within the field."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of theoretical understanding guiding the optimization of large, costly deep learning models. Understanding phenomena like the Edge of Stability and the impact of large learning rates/noise through a more rigorous theoretical lens (continuous approximations) could lead to more principled optimization strategies, better hyperparameter tuning guidelines, reduced computational waste, and potentially more efficient algorithms. This directly contributes to the workshop's goal of building a useful mathematical theory for modern ML."
