        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the call for contributions, including 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice', 'Convergence analysis beyond the stable regime', understanding the 'Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon', using 'Continuous approximations of training trajectories' (SDEs), and developing 'Advanced optimization algorithms' (an adaptive spectral step-sizer). The goal of bridging the gap between theory (SSF model) and practice (faster convergence, reduced tuning for large models) is central to the workshop's theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (EoS challenges, tuning costs), the core proposal (SSF model, adaptive spectral control), the methodology (Hessian estimation, calibration, implementation, validation), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. While the underlying mathematics of SSF might be complex, the research plan itself is presented with high clarity and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using SDEs to model SGD and analyzing Hessian eigenspectra are known concepts, the specific proposal of a 'Spectral Stochastic Flow' (SSF) projected onto Hessian eigenspaces appears novel. Furthermore, using this SSF to derive closed-form EoS criteria and designing an adaptive step-sizer that controls stability *per eigenmode* based on these criteria represents an innovative approach to optimization, distinct from existing adaptive methods. It combines existing theoretical tools in a new way to address a specific practical challenge."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some computational challenges. Estimating leading Hessian eigenpairs on-the-fly using methods like subspace iteration is possible but computationally intensive, especially for large models and frequent updates. The practicality hinges on whether the computational overhead of this spectral analysis is outweighed by the gains in convergence speed and stability. Calibrating the diffusion term and implementing the custom optimizer are standard research tasks. Validation requires significant computational resources but is standard for the benchmarks mentioned (ResNets, Transformers). The feasibility is good, but scalability needs careful consideration and efficient implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical and poorly understood EoS phenomenon, which is prevalent and challenging in modern large-scale deep learning. Developing a principled method to control training dynamics in this regime could lead to faster convergence, improved stability, and significantly reduced hyperparameter tuning costs, addressing major pain points in training billion-parameter models. Furthermore, providing a theoretical framework (SSF) that connects continuous dynamics to discrete optimization practice contributes significantly to the mathematical understanding of deep learning, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
