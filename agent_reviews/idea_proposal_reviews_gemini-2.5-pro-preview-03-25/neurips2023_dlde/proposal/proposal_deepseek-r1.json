    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (symbiosis of DL and DEs, specifically mentioning diffusion models and solving high-D PDEs), the research idea (diffusion for high-D PDEs, integrating physics constraints), and the literature review (building on recent works like latent/physics-informed diffusion). It directly addresses the workshop's theme and tackles key challenges identified in the literature (scalability, generalization). The objectives and methodology directly stem from the research idea and are positioned relative to the cited works."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, the methodology section outlines the core components (PDE-informed SDEs, hybrid loss, architecture), and the experimental plan is specific. The mathematical notation for the SDEs and loss function is presented, though perhaps dense for non-experts. The structure is logical. Minor refinements could further clarify the exact implementation details of applying the PDE operator within the SDE and the estimation of the denoised solution for the residual loss, but overall clarity is good."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has some originality, particularly in the specific formulation of the PDE-informed forward SDE drift term (du_t = [L_theta u_t - beta(t) u_t] dt + ...). However, the core concept of physics-informed diffusion models with hybrid losses combining score-matching and PDE residuals is very similar to recent work, notably [6] (Johnson & Lee, 2024) as described in the literature review. The proposal acknowledges [6] but doesn't sufficiently differentiate its specific contribution beyond stating prior works 'lack a unified approach that tightly couples PDE dynamics into both the forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes'. Without clearer distinction from [6], the novelty appears more incremental than groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid theoretical foundations (diffusion models, SDEs, physics-informed learning). The proposed methodology, including the PDE-informed SDEs and the hybrid loss function, is conceptually well-justified. Using a U-Net with Fourier layers is appropriate. However, the practical stability and numerical implementation of the custom forward SDE involving the PDE operator L_theta require empirical validation. The assumption that the denoised estimate u_0(u_t) can be effectively used within the loss needs careful handling. Technical formulations appear mostly correct at this level of detail."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. Training high-dimensional diffusion models requires substantial computational resources (GPUs). Implementing the custom PDE-informed SDE and efficiently applying the L_theta operator within the diffusion steps will require careful engineering. Tuning the noise schedule and the loss weighting lambda adds complexity. However, the experimental plan is concrete, leveraging known benchmarks and standard techniques like latent compression and curriculum learning. The risks are manageable with appropriate expertise and resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Solving high-dimensional PDEs is a critical bottleneck in many scientific and engineering fields. The potential to outperform existing methods (PINNs, neural operators, spectral methods) in terms of accuracy, speed, and scalability, especially in 100+ dimensions, would represent a major advancement. The ability to handle parameterized PDEs and provide uncertainty quantification further enhances the potential impact across domains like fluid dynamics, finance, and quantum chemistry."
