    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of symbiosis between DL and DEs, focusing on neural architectures (neural operators, diffusion models) for solving challenging DEs (high-dimensional PDEs). The proposed DGNO framework directly implements the research idea by combining diffusion models and neural operators to tackle the curse of dimensionality. It clearly positions itself within the context of the provided literature, citing relevant works on PINNs, neural operators, and existing diffusion-based PDE solvers (#2, #6, #7, #9, #10), while aiming to improve upon them, particularly in the high-dimensional regime (100+ dimensions) identified as a key challenge."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction effectively motivates the problem and positions the work. The objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the theoretical framework (including mathematical formulations for the SDEs and loss functions), the neural network architecture (modified FNO with conditioning), the training procedure (hybrid loss, curriculum learning, efficiency techniques), and the solving process. The experimental design is thorough, specifying benchmarks, comparison methods, metrics, and protocols. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the use of diffusion models for PDE solving is an emerging area with existing work (cited in the literature review, e.g., #2, #6, #7), the proposal introduces specific novel elements. The primary novelty lies in the proposed 'Diffusion-Guided Neural Operator' (DGNO) framework, particularly the modification of the *forward* diffusion SDE to incorporate the PDE operator \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\theta, aiming to guide the noise process according to the physics. Combining this guided diffusion with a neural *operator* (FNO-based) architecture specifically designed for function spaces as the score network, and applying it explicitly to very high-dimensional (100+) PDEs, represents a fresh integration of ideas. While components exist separately, their specific combination and the guided forward process offer a distinct approach compared to prior work which often focuses on latent spaces or physics-informed losses during training/sampling."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, built upon established foundations of diffusion models, SDEs, neural operators (FNO), and physics-informed learning. The mathematical formulations for the standard reverse SDE, score matching loss, and physics-based losses are correct. The proposed neural architecture and training strategies are appropriate. However, the core novelty – modifying the forward SDE `du_t = [-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta(t)u_t + \\alpha(t)\\mathcal{L}_\\theta u_t]dt + \\sqrt{\\beta(t)}dW_t` – requires further theoretical justification regarding its well-posedness, the properties of the resulting process, and its impact on the score function and the reverse process. While intuitively appealing, the theoretical underpinnings and practical stability of this guided forward process need rigorous analysis and validation, representing a minor gap in the current justification. The rest of the methodology appears robust."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training diffusion models combined with neural operators on high-dimensional function data is computationally very demanding (memory, compute time). The proposal acknowledges this and suggests sensible mitigation strategies (mixed precision, gradient accumulation, progressive dimensionality), but success hinges on access to substantial computational resources. Implementing the custom guided forward SDE and ensuring its stability, along with the complex hybrid training, requires significant expertise. Generating high-fidelity ground truth data for training and evaluation in very high dimensions (e.g., d=500) is a major challenge, potentially limiting rigorous validation in the highest target dimensions. While the plan is detailed, the computational and data generation hurdles make the feasibility satisfactory rather than high."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: overcoming the curse of dimensionality in solving high-dimensional PDEs. This is a fundamental bottleneck in numerous scientific and engineering fields (fluid dynamics, finance, quantum mechanics, climate science). A successful outcome, demonstrating efficient and accurate solutions for PDEs in 100+ dimensions, would represent a major advancement with transformative potential. It could enable previously intractable simulations and analyses, accelerating research and development across multiple domains. The clearly articulated potential impact on scientific computing, engineering design, financial modeling, and climate science underscores the high significance of this research."
