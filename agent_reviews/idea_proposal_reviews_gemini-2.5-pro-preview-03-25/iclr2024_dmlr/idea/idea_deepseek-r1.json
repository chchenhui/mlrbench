        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed in the workshop call, including 'Construction of datasets from large quantities of unlabeled/uncurated data', 'Model-assisted dataset construction', 'Quality signals for large-scale datasets', 'Datasets for specific applications' (explicitly mentioning new domains like healthcare and climate science), 'Impact of dataset drifts', 'Ethical considerations for and governance of large-scale datasets', and 'Data curation and HCI' (via the active curation loop). The focus on data-centric approaches for foundation models in specialized domains fits the workshop's aims precisely."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main components (FM-assisted labeling, active curation loop, drift handling, quality metric), target domains, and goals are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The iterative process is easy to understand. Minor details, such as the exact mechanism for integrating 'temporal signals' or the precise formulation of the 'dynamic quality metric', could be further elaborated, but the overall concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like model-assisted labeling and active learning exist, the proposed integration into a *dynamic* curation framework specifically targeting dataset drift in specialized domains using FMs is innovative. The inclusion of temporal signals, user feedback for updates, and a multi-faceted dynamic quality metric (coherence, diversity, fairness) adds fresh perspectives. It combines existing concepts in a novel way to address the specific challenge of maintaining high-quality, evolving datasets for specialized FM applications."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. Accessing pretrained FMs and implementing active learning loops are standard. The main challenges lie in securing access to sufficient domain-specific data and sustained engagement from human experts for the active curation loop, which can be resource-intensive. Defining and operationalizing the 'dynamic quality metric' and effectively integrating 'temporal signals' (e.g., parsing new research) automatically will require careful design and engineering effort. While not straightforward, these challenges seem surmountable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical bottleneck of creating and maintaining high-quality, up-to-date datasets in specialized domains like healthcare and climate science, where data is often fragmented and expert-dependent. Improving dataset quality directly impacts the robustness, generalizability, and fairness of foundation models in these high-stakes areas. Tackling dataset drift is crucial for real-world applicability. Furthermore, the focus on democratizing dataset creation and embedding governance protocols has broad positive implications."
