    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Impact of dataset drifts in large-scale models', proposes methods related to 'Data curation' and continuous 'Construction of datasets', and focuses on data challenges for foundation models. The core theme is data-centric, aiming to maintain model relevance through dynamic data management, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals. While it doesn't explicitly mention 'new domains', the proposed framework is general enough to be applicable beyond standard vision/language tasks."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem of static datasets and data drift. The main idea is well-defined, breaking down the proposed framework into three understandable components: drift detection, adaptive sampling, and progressive integration. The overall goal of continuous learning and maintaining relevance is explicitly stated. The language is concise and unambiguous, making the core concept easy to grasp, even if specific implementation details are high-level as expected for an idea summary."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While concepts like continual learning, data stream processing, drift detection, and adaptive sampling exist individually, integrating them into a cohesive framework specifically designed for the continuous updating and data management of large-scale foundation models is innovative. Current foundation model practices often rely on large, static datasets or periodic full retraining. This proposal offers a different paradigm focused on dynamic, continuous data integration, which represents a fresh perspective in the context of foundation models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The individual components (drift detection, sampling, selective updates) have bases in existing research. However, scaling these components to the massive size of foundation models and their datasets poses considerable technical hurdles. Efficiently detecting drift, sampling meaningfully from high-velocity streams, and integrating data progressively without catastrophic forgetting or excessive computational cost are major challenges. Significant engineering effort and potentially novel algorithmic refinements would be required for practical implementation at scale."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and increasingly relevant problem of foundation model staleness due to evolving real-world data distributions (data drift). Successfully implementing such a framework could dramatically extend the useful lifespan of foundation models, significantly reduce the enormous costs associated with periodic retraining, and lead to more adaptive and robust AI systems. This has broad implications across various domains and contributes to more sustainable AI development practices."
