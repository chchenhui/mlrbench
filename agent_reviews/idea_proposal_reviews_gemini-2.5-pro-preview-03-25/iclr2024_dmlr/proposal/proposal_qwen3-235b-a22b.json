        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of data-centric AI for foundation models, model-assisted dataset construction, multi-domain challenges, data quality, and efficient curation, all mentioned in the task description. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the UMC pipeline. Furthermore, it incorporates concepts and addresses challenges (uncertainty, exploration/exploitation, HCI) highlighted in the literature review, citing relevant papers appropriately (e.g., Zha et al., Najjar et al., Bojic et al., Saveliev et al.). The focus on multi-domain aspects and benchmark contributions (DataPerf) fits perfectly with the workshop's aims."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology follows a logical structure, visualized partially by Figure 1. Key components like uncertainty calculation and the MAB allocation strategy are mathematically formulated. The experimental design is clearly outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact nature/origin of the initial 'domain specialist' ensemble, the specifics of the 'feedback hooks' in the interface, and the precise relationship between the ensemble models and the single FM being retrained. However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like uncertainty sampling, ensemble methods, clustering for diversity, MABs for allocation, and human-in-the-loop curation exist in prior work (some cited, e.g., Li et al., Ash et al., Saveliev et al.), their specific synthesis within the UMC framework is novel. Specifically, the combination of confidence and inter-model disagreement for uncertainty, using clustering on these uncertain samples for diverse batch selection, and employing a domain-level MAB for resource allocation in the context of multi-domain foundation model curation presents a fresh approach. It clearly distinguishes itself from standard baselines like random or simple uncertainty sampling."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established techniques like ensemble uncertainty estimation (confidence, KL-divergence), dimensionality reduction (UMAP), clustering (hierarchical), and multi-armed bandits (UCB). The mathematical formulations provided are correct. The proposed iterative pipeline is logical for an active learning/curation setting. The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines, multiple evaluation metrics targeting efficiency, robustness, and coverage, and appropriate statistical validation methods. Potential minor weaknesses include the reliance on the quality of the initial ensemble and the heuristic nature of using mean uncertainty as the MAB reward signal, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML technologies and libraries. The core algorithms (ensemble inference, clustering, MAB, model fine-tuning) are implementable. However, integrating these components into a smooth iterative pipeline with an interactive human-in-the-loop interface requires significant engineering effort. Scaling the process (especially ensemble inference and clustering) to very large unlabeled datasets could pose challenges. Access to diverse pre-trained models, multi-domain datasets, and human annotation resources is necessary but standard for this type of research. The claimed 30-50% cost reduction is ambitious and depends on empirical outcomes. Overall, it's feasible but requires substantial resources and careful implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the costly and challenging process of curating large-scale, high-quality datasets for multi-domain foundation models. This is a recognized bottleneck in the field of data-centric AI. Successfully reducing annotation costs (potentially by 30-50%) and improving model robustness to domain shift would be major contributions. The focus on multi-domain applicability broadens the impact beyond single-domain studies. The potential applications in Earth observation and biomedical NLP are impactful, and contributing to benchmarks like DataPerf enhances community value. The research has strong potential to advance both the theory and practice of data curation for modern AI."
