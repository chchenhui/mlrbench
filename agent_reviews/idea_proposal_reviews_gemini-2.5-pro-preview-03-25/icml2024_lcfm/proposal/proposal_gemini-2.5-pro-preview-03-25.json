    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (Workshop on LCFMs, focusing on efficiency, evaluation, and understanding), the research idea (using historical attention for dynamic KV cache compression), and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of efficiency techniques for LCFMs. It builds upon the cited literature, positioning the proposed ADKVC method relative to existing approaches like FastKV, DynamicKV, and KV-Distill, and explicitly tackles key challenges identified (balancing compression/performance, adaptive strategies, memory management, generalization). The proposal consistently elaborates on the core idea throughout its sections without contradictions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background section effectively explains the KV cache problem in LCFMs. The research idea, objectives, and proposed ADKVC method (including attention tracking variants and compression policies like dynamic quantization/eviction) are articulated precisely and logically. The modified inference algorithm is outlined step-by-step. The experimental design, including models, baselines, datasets, and metrics, is detailed and unambiguous. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the entire proposal immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While KV cache compression and attention-aware methods exist (as shown in the literature review), the core idea of using *accumulated historical* attention scores (via Max-Pooling or EMA over the generation process) to *dynamically* guide compression (quantization levels or eviction priority) on a per-token or per-block basis appears novel. It differs clearly from recency-based methods (like H2O baseline), layer-selective methods (FastKV), task-adaptive methods (DynamicKV), and learned compression (KV-Distill). The novelty is well-articulated in section 1.2."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous. The motivation is strong, based on the known KV cache bottleneck. The core hypothesis – that historical attention correlates with future token importance – is plausible, although it requires empirical validation which is part of the plan. The proposed methods (EMA/Max-pooling for tracking, dynamic quantization/eviction) leverage standard techniques in a novel combination. The technical formulations are clear. However, the effectiveness heavily relies on the strength of the attention-importance correlation. Potential overheads from tracking relevance scores and dynamic dequantization/re-quantization are acknowledged but need careful management. The mapping from relevance scores to compression levels involves hyperparameters requiring careful tuning, which adds complexity."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Implementing the attention tracking and dynamic compression logic within existing frameworks (Hugging Face, vLLM) is achievable for experienced ML researchers. The required resources (pretrained LCFMs, benchmark datasets, compute for evaluation) are standard for this type of research, although potentially demanding. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and uses established benchmarks. Potential challenges like computational overhead and hyperparameter tuning are acknowledged. Re-implementing SOTA baselines is noted as potentially challenging but not critical for core evaluation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the KV cache memory bottleneck, which is a critical barrier to scaling and deploying LCFMs. If successful, ADKVC could lead to major advancements by enabling much longer effective context lengths on existing hardware, improving efficiency (memory, potentially speed), and democratizing access to powerful LCFMs. The research directly contributes to the workshop's themes of LCFM efficiency and understanding (via attention analysis). The potential impact is substantial."
