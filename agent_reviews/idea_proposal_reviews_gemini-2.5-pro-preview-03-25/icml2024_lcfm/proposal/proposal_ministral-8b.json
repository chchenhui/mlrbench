    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (focusing on efficiency techniques for long-context models), the research idea (elaborating on attention-guided dynamic KV cache compression), and the literature review (acknowledging and aiming to build upon existing methods like FastKV, DynamicKV, KV-Distill, and addressing identified challenges). It directly targets a key topic of the workshop and proposes a solution consistent with the provided idea and context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear in its objectives, overall methodology, and significance. However, the core technical description of the algorithm and especially the mathematical formulation lacks precision and clarity. The formula provided (C_j = alpha * sum(A_ij) + (1 - alpha) * beta * sum(A_ij)) seems overly simplistic, potentially incorrect, and doesn't clearly represent how *historical* attention patterns influence compression strength (quantization bits, eviction rate) or how the baseline strength beta is integrated. It appears to just scale the current attention sum. This ambiguity in the central mechanism detracts from the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While using attention scores for importance estimation isn't entirely new (as hinted by titles like 'Context-Aware KV Cache Compression' and 'Attention-Based Token Pruning' in the literature review), the specific focus on using *historical* attention patterns to *dynamically* adjust compression *strength* (quantization/eviction) per token offers some distinction from methods focusing solely on current attention, task-level adaptation (DynamicKV), learned compression (KV-Distill), or selective propagation (FastKV). However, the novelty isn't groundbreaking and needs clearer differentiation from potentially similar existing context-aware or attention-based pruning/compression techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound. The underlying intuition that attention scores correlate with token importance is reasonable. The research design follows standard practices, and the planned experiments include relevant baselines and metrics. However, the technical soundness is weakened by the unclear and potentially flawed mathematical formulation. It fails to adequately formalize the core idea of using historical attention to guide dynamic compression. Without a more rigorous technical description of the mechanism, the soundness remains questionable."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Accessing attention scores and modifying KV cache management during inference is technically achievable. Required resources (models, datasets, compute) are standard for this type of research. The main challenge lies in efficiently implementing the dynamic compression without introducing excessive computational overhead that negates the benefits. The risk that the attention history heuristic might not be universally effective exists but is typical for such research. Overall, the plan is realistic and implementable with current technology."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the field: the excessive memory consumption of the KV cache in long-context foundation models, which is a major bottleneck for deployment and scaling. Developing effective compression techniques, especially adaptive ones that preserve crucial information, could have a substantial impact on the practicality and accessibility of these powerful models. Success would represent a meaningful contribution to efficient AI."
