        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly lists 'Efficiency techniques for (long-context) foundation models' as a key topic for the workshop. The proposed idea directly addresses this by focusing on reducing the KV cache memory footprint during inference for Long-Context Foundation Models (LCFMs), which is a critical efficiency challenge."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the problem (KV cache memory consumption), the limitation of existing methods (uniform compression risks), the proposed solution (dynamic compression based on historical attention), and the intended outcome (reduced memory with minimal performance loss). The mechanism of using attention scores to guide compression strength is explained concisely."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While KV cache compression and attention mechanisms are established concepts, the proposed method of dynamically adjusting the *strength* of compression (quantization, pruning) for different cache entries based on *historical* attention patterns offers a nuanced and potentially innovative approach compared to uniform compression or simple attention-based eviction strategies (like keeping only the most recent or highest-attention tokens without varying compression levels). It combines existing ideas in a refined, adaptive manner."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Implementing KV cache modifications, attention score tracking, and dynamic quantization/pruning is achievable with current deep learning frameworks. The main challenges would be efficiently tracking and aggregating historical attention scores without introducing excessive computational overhead that negates the memory savings, and carefully tuning the mapping from attention history to compression levels. However, these are engineering and research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. The KV cache size is a primary bottleneck limiting the practical context length and deployment of LCFMs, especially on resource-constrained hardware. An effective method to reduce this memory footprint while preserving performance on long-range tasks would be a major advancement, enabling wider adoption and application of LCFMs. It addresses a critical and timely problem in the field."
