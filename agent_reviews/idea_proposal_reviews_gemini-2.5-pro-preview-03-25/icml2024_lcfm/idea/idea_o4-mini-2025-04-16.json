        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task description. It directly addresses the core challenge of synthesizing information over extreme-length contexts (millions of tokens). It proposes a novel modeling strategy combining retrieval and compression, targets efficiency improvements (sublinear scaling), explicitly mentions retrieval-augmented models, and lists relevant interdisciplinary applications (QA, code, genomics), hitting multiple key topics listed for the workshop (New modeling, Efficiency techniques, Retrieval-augmented models, Interdisciplinary applications)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the main components of the proposed pipeline (retriever, hierarchical compressor, specialized transformer) are outlined. The concept of multi-granularity summaries and adaptive attention is understandable. However, specific details about the 'gated summarization', 'hierarchical cross-attention layers', and the 'combined retrieval-and-language-modeling objective' could be more precise, leaving minor ambiguities that would require elaboration in a full proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While retrieval augmentation, context compression, and hierarchical attention exist independently, the proposed integration into an end-to-end trainable system specifically designed for extreme-length contexts using multi-granularity compression and adaptive hierarchical attention is innovative. Jointly training the retriever, compressor, and transformer with a combined objective for this specific hierarchical structure offers a fresh perspective compared to standard RAG or simpler compression techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current deep learning techniques, as the components (retrievers, attention, transformers) are known entities. However, implementing and training such a complex, multi-stage system end-to-end presents significant engineering challenges. Ensuring stable joint training, managing the computational cost (likely very high), and acquiring suitable large-scale datasets for extreme contexts are considerable hurdles. The feasibility depends heavily on access to substantial computational resources and careful implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Effectively processing million-token contexts is a major bottleneck for current AI systems and a critical need for applications like in-depth document analysis, large codebase understanding, and genomics. A successful implementation achieving improved accuracy and efficiency (sublinear scaling) would represent a major advancement in the capabilities of foundation models, potentially unlocking new applications and research directions. Addressing this extreme scale is highly impactful."
