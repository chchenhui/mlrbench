        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's theme of combining scientific and machine learning modeling. It directly proposes a hybrid approach (scientific simulator data + FNO + residual ML model) to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. It addresses the workshop's goals of unlocking new applications for scientific models (via acceleration and bias correction) and leveraging scientific models (simulator data, physics constraints) to improve ML models. It fits well within the 'Methodological and theoretical study' topic, focusing on model architecture and learning algorithms for hybrid modeling."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation highlighting the limitations of simulators and pure ML models is well-defined. The proposed two-stage framework (FNO surrogate + residual correction) is explained logically. Key components like physics-informed losses and uncertainty quantification are mentioned, enhancing clarity. While specific architectural details of the residual network or the exact formulation of physics losses could be further elaborated, the core concept and workflow are readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While hybrid modeling, using neural operators (like FNOs) as surrogates, residual learning for error correction, and physics-informed losses are all existing concepts in ML and scientific computing, the specific proposed combination within a two-stage framework tailored for correcting systematic simulator errors using a lightweight residual network on top of an FNO surrogate offers a degree of originality. It represents a thoughtful integration of existing techniques rather than a fundamentally new paradigm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It relies on established techniques like Fourier Neural Operators, residual networks, and physics-informed training, which have existing implementations and theoretical backing. Access to a scientific simulator is required to generate initial (coarse) training data, which is inherent to the problem setting. Standard ML hardware and software should be sufficient for training the FNO and the lightweight residual network. The main challenges might lie in efficiently generating the initial simulator data and carefully formulating effective physics-informed loss terms for specific complex systems, but these seem surmountable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Addressing the computational cost and potential inaccuracies (due to simplifying assumptions) of scientific simulators is a critical challenge in many scientific and engineering fields. If successful, this hybrid approach could enable near real-time analysis, accelerate design cycles, improve forecasting, and make high-fidelity modeling accessible to researchers with fewer computational resources. Correcting systematic biases while retaining speed is a valuable contribution."
