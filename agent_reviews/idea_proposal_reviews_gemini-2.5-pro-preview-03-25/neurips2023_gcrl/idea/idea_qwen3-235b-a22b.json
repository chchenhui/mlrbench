        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL), explicitly proposes connections to Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Representation Learning (key workshop topics), suggests a new algorithm/method to improve GCRL (addressing sample efficiency and sparse rewards), and targets relevant application domains mentioned in the call (robotics via Meta-World, molecular design). It fits squarely within the solicited topics of Algorithms, Connections, and Applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-defined (sparse rewards, sample efficiency in GCRL), the main technical approach (two-stage SSL + GCRL, contrastive learning, hierarchical attention, context-aware loss) is clearly outlined, and the evaluation plan (Meta-World, molecular generation, key metrics) is specified. The core innovation ('context-aware contrastive loss') is highlighted. While the exact mathematical formulation of the loss isn't provided (which is acceptable for a proposal), the overall concept and workflow are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While combining GCRL with SSL/representation learning and using contrastive methods isn't entirely new, the specific proposal of a 'context-aware contrastive loss' designed to align representations across *temporally distant* goals within successful trajectories seems innovative. This focus on leveraging temporal structure for potentially learning subgoals distinguishes it from standard contrastive approaches in RL that often focus on more local temporal consistency. Applying this specific mechanism across both continuous robotics and discrete molecular generation domains also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible. It builds upon established techniques like GCRL agents (e.g., SAC), contrastive learning, and attention mechanisms. The proposed two-stage training process (SSL pre-training followed by RL fine-tuning/integration) is a common and practical paradigm. Standard benchmarks like Meta-World are readily available. While implementing and tuning the novel 'context-aware contrastive loss' effectively presents a research challenge, and 3D molecular generation requires specific environments, the overall approach does not rely on unavailable technology or fundamentally impractical assumptions. Required computational resources are likely significant but standard for deep RL research."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. It tackles critical challenges in GCRL: sample efficiency, sparse rewards, and the need for better generalization, particularly in complex, real-world relevant domains like robotics and molecular design. Improving goal representations through SSL could lead to substantial performance gains. The potential to learn more abstract representations that capture subgoals or enable compositional generalization would be a valuable contribution. Furthermore, successfully bridging GCRL and representation learning aligns perfectly with the workshop's aims and broader trends in ML."
