    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly proposes a novel GCRL algorithm focused on integrating causal reasoning, which is explicitly mentioned as a key question ('Do GCRL algorithms provide an effective mechanism for causal reasoning?'). It also targets applications like precision medicine and molecular design, both highlighted in the workshop description as relevant areas, particularly where GCRL could be applied more effectively. The proposal involves new methods and touches upon self-supervised learning for the world model, aligning well with the workshop's topics on algorithms and connections to other ML areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, outlining the limitations of current GCRL and the potential benefits of incorporating causality. The core components (SCWM, observational/counterfactual learning, conditioning on goal and intervention, counterfactual rollouts for policy gradients) are described logically. The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. While specific architectural details or mathematical formulations are omitted (as expected in a brief idea description), the overall concept and approach are understandable with only minor ambiguities regarding the exact implementation of the self-supervised objectives or the policy gradient computation over counterfactuals."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While world models, GCRL, and causal RL are existing fields, the specific proposal to integrate a *latent structural causal world model* capable of generating *counterfactual* trajectories, and using these counterfactuals directly within the GCRL policy optimization loop by conditioning on both goals and *interventions*, represents a novel synthesis. It moves beyond standard model-based RL or observational GCRL by explicitly modeling and leveraging interventional, counterfactual reasoning for goal achievement. This specific mechanism for 'causal GCRL' appears innovative."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Learning accurate latent structural causal models from data, especially ones that support reliable counterfactual generation, is notoriously difficult and an active research area itself. Integrating this complex causal model within a GCRL framework, training it effectively via self-supervision, and ensuring stable policy optimization based on potentially noisy counterfactual rollouts requires substantial technical expertise and careful engineering. While conceptually sound, practical implementation might require simplified assumptions or specific environmental structures to be tractable initially. Significant effort and potentially large datasets would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the lack of causal reasoning and intervention planning in GCRL is critical for applying these methods safely and effectively in complex, real-world domains like precision medicine or robotics where understanding the consequences of actions (interventions) is paramount. Success would represent a major advancement, enabling agents to plan interventions proactively rather than just reactively reaching goals. This could lead to more robust, interpretable, and sample-efficient GCRL agents, potentially unlocking applications where current methods fall short due to safety or interpretability concerns."
