    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on GCRL, its connections to SSL/representation learning, algorithmic improvements, and applications (robotics, molecular design). The proposed SCALR framework directly implements the research idea, tackling challenges like sparse rewards and representation quality identified in the idea and literature review. Key concepts and specific papers from the literature review (e.g., hierarchical attention, context-aware loss inspiration, recent GCRL+SSL works) are effectively integrated and cited to motivate the approach and experimental design. It comprehensively covers the requirements and context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with background and problem statement, moving to the proposed solution (SCALR), detailing objectives, methodology, and expected impact. The core concepts (hierarchical attention, context-aware contrastive loss) are explained well, and the algorithmic details, including the loss function formulation and the two-stage process, are clearly articulated. The experimental design is thorough and easy to understand. Minor ambiguities regarding the exact implementation specifics of 'context-awareness' beyond sampling strategies are present but acceptable at the proposal stage."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing work in GCRL, SSL, contrastive learning, and attention mechanisms, the core novelty lies in the specific combination and formulation: integrating hierarchical attention with a *context-aware* contrastive loss tailored for learning goal-state representations in GCRL. This context-aware aspect, aiming to capture long-range temporal dependencies and potential subgoal structures beyond simple proximity or standard contrastive setups, represents a fresh perspective. The proposal clearly distinguishes its approach (SCALR) from related work cited in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established GCRL (SAC+HER) and SSL (InfoNCE contrastive learning) principles. The methodology, including the two-stage learning process and the use of attention mechanisms, is technically sound. The mathematical formulation for the contrastive loss is provided and correct. The justification for each component is logical. Minor weaknesses include the inherent empirical uncertainty about the effectiveness of the proposed context-aware sampling/weighting strategies and potential training stability challenges, but the overall technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard ML techniques (deep learning, RL, contrastive learning), benchmarks (Meta-World), and computational resources (GPUs). The proposed algorithms use existing building blocks. The experimental plan is detailed and realistic. Potential challenges lie in the careful implementation and tuning of the novel context-aware loss and hierarchical attention mechanisms, ensuring training stability (especially if concurrent), and achieving significant performance gains on complex benchmarks. However, these are typical research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and widely recognized challenges in GCRL, namely sample efficiency in sparse reward settings, representation learning for generalization, and transfer learning. Success would represent a substantial algorithmic advancement in GCRL. The research directly aligns with the workshop's key themes (Algorithms, Connections, Future Directions, Applications) and has clear potential to facilitate GCRL application in important domains like robotics and molecular discovery. The potential for generating more structured and interpretable representations further adds to its significance."
