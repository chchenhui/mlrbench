        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on GCRL, its connections to self-supervised learning and representation learning, algorithmic improvements, and applications (robotics via Meta-World, molecular generation). The research objectives and methodology are derived directly from the research idea, tackling key challenges (sparse rewards, sample efficiency, representation quality, transferability, interpretability) identified in both the idea and the literature review. The proposed techniques (contrastive learning, hierarchical attention, context-aware loss) are well-grounded in the provided recent literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, two-stage methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are easy to understand. The core concepts like contrastive learning and the context-aware loss are explained. However, some technical details could be slightly more explicit, such as the precise architecture of the hierarchical attention module, the exact sampling strategy for positive/negative pairs in the contrastive losses, and the specifics of integrating the learned representation into the SAC algorithm. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several recent techniques (self-supervised contrastive learning, hierarchical attention, context-aware contrastive loss) into a cohesive framework for GCRL representation learning. While the individual components draw inspiration from or exist in the cited literature (e.g., SSL for GCRL, contrastive methods, attention, context-aware losses), their specific combination and application, particularly the use of a context-aware loss to align temporally distant goals alongside hierarchical attention for subgoal inference and generalization in GCRL, offers a novel approach. It's a thoughtful synthesis and extension of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations in GCRL, self-supervised learning, contrastive learning, and attention mechanisms. The two-stage methodology (representation learning followed by RL) is logical. The rationale for using contrastive learning and attention for better representations is well-justified. The technical formulations for the contrastive losses and Q-learning are provided, although slightly simplified. The soundness could be further improved by providing more explicit details on the hierarchical attention implementation and the precise mechanism for integrating the learned representations into the chosen GCRL algorithm (SAC)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard ML techniques (contrastive learning, attention, SAC) and platforms (Meta-World, molecular generation environments/datasets). The required computational resources (GPUs) and software libraries are commonly available in ML research settings. Implementing and integrating the different components (SSL module, attention, GCRL agent) is achievable with standard ML engineering effort. Potential challenges include hyperparameter tuning for the contrastive losses and ensuring effective integration, but these are common research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it tackles critical and timely challenges in GCRL, namely sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings, generalization across tasks, and interpretability of representations â€“ all highlighted as important by the workshop call and recent literature. By proposing a method that integrates SSL with GCRL, it directly addresses the workshop's interest in connections between these fields. If successful, the research could lead to more practical and effective GCRL algorithms applicable to complex domains like robotics and molecular design, potentially enabling better causal reasoning and accelerating real-world deployment, thus having a substantial impact on the field."
