    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the connections between GCRL and representation/self-supervised learning, limitations of existing methods (sample inefficiency, sparse rewards), and improving algorithms for broader applications (robotics, molecular design). The methodology closely follows the research idea, detailing the integration of SSL (contrastive learning, hierarchical attention) with GCRL (SAC, HER). Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the challenges identified in the literature review (sparse rewards, sample inefficiency, representation quality, transferability) and positions itself relevantly within the recent advancements cited."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Experiments, Impact). The objectives are explicitly stated, and the proposed methodology (CGSA) is detailed with specific components (hierarchical attention encoder, context-aware contrastive loss, temporal consistency loss, SAC integration, enhanced HER) and mathematical formulations where appropriate. The rationale for design choices is well-explained, making the proposal easy to understand with minimal ambiguity. The experimental design is also clearly laid out."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal integrates several recent trends in GCRL and SSL, such as contrastive learning, hierarchical attention, and HER. While the integration of SSL and GCRL is an active research area (acknowledged by the literature review), the specific contributions lie in the proposed 'context-aware contrastive loss' that weights negatives by estimated distance and enforces temporal consistency, and the specific hierarchical attention architecture combined with an enhanced HER leveraging the learned representations. However, similar concepts (context-aware losses, hierarchical attention, contrastive GCRL) exist in recent literature (e.g., papers 5, 6, 7, 9 in the review). Therefore, the novelty is satisfactory, residing more in the specific formulation and synthesis of these ideas rather than introducing a completely new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established methods like SAC, HER, contrastive learning, and attention mechanisms. The rationale for combining these techniques to improve sample efficiency and representation quality in GCRL is well-justified. The mathematical formulations provided for the attention mechanism and loss functions appear correct. The overall methodology is coherent and grounded in recent research cited in the literature review. Minor gaps exist in the specification of certain details (e.g., the exact d_{est} function, the approximation for mutual information in enhanced HER), but the core technical approach is robust and well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. The required components (SAC, attention, contrastive learning) are standard, and benchmarks (Meta-World, MolGym) are available. However, the proposed system is complex, integrating multiple advanced techniques (hierarchical attention, custom contrastive/temporal losses, enhanced HER, hierarchical goal generation). Implementing, debugging, and tuning this integrated system will require significant effort, expertise, and computational resources (GPUs). While achievable within a research context, the complexity introduces moderate risks regarding the timeline and successful optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses significant and widely recognized challenges in GCRL: sample inefficiency and poor generalization, particularly in sparse-reward settings. Improving these aspects would be highly impactful, enabling broader application of GCRL to complex real-world problems like robotic manipulation and molecular design, as targeted in the proposal. The research aligns well with the workshop's goals and has the potential to make meaningful contributions to both GCRL methodology and its practical applications. The potential for theoretical insights into the interplay of representation learning and RL further enhances its significance."
