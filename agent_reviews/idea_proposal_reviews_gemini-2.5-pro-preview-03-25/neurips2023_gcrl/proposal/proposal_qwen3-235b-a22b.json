    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on GCRL algorithms, connections to representation learning and SSL, and applications in molecular design and robotics (via Meta-World). The methodology implements the core research idea (two-stage SSL+GCRL framework, hierarchical attention, contrastive loss) and builds upon concepts and addresses challenges (sparse rewards, sample efficiency, representation learning) highlighted in the literature review. Baselines like JaxGCRL are appropriately included. There are no significant inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, two-stage methodology, technical components (attention, contrastive loss, SAC integration), and experimental plan are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. Equations for key components are provided. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of 'context-aware' beyond successful trajectories, the exact mechanism for 'abstract subgoal inference' beyond k-means clustering, and the absence of the mentioned Figure 1 slightly hinders full visualization. However, these do not significantly obscure the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several recent advancements in a novel way. While components like hierarchical attention (White et al., 2023), contrastive learning for representations in RL (Patil et al., 2024; Doe et al., 2023), and context-aware losses (Black et al., 2023) exist, their specific integration within a two-stage GCRL framework focused on aligning temporally distant goals via a tailored contrastive loss appears novel. The claim of being the 'First integration of hierarchical attention and context-aware contrastive learning in GCRL' seems plausible based on the provided literature. It offers a fresh perspective compared to individual cited works."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in GCRL (SAC, HER) and SSL (contrastive learning, attention). The proposed two-stage methodology is logical and well-justified for tackling sample efficiency and representation learning. Technical formulations for attention and contrastive loss appear correct. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant domains, strong baselines (JaxGCRL, Patil et al.), and appropriate metrics. Minor weaknesses include the need for careful implementation of the contrastive sampling strategy (defining positive/negative pairs, 'context') and the reliance on k-means for subgoal interpretability, which might require further validation. The connection to causal reasoning is mentioned but not deeply substantiated in the methodology."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It utilizes established techniques (SAC, Attention, Contrastive Learning) implementable with standard ML libraries and hardware (GPUs). Benchmarks like Meta-World are accessible. The two-stage approach is practical. Potential challenges include the computational cost of pre-training and RL, the sensitivity of representation quality to initial exploration data (acknowledged as a limitation), and the tuning complexity of the integrated system. However, these are common challenges in RL/SSL research, and the proposal acknowledges scalability concerns, suggesting a realistic outlook."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses critical and widely recognized bottlenecks in GCRL: sample efficiency in sparse-reward environments, compositional generalization, and learning meaningful goal/state representations without extensive reward engineering. Success would represent a substantial advancement, making GCRL more applicable to complex real-world problems like molecular generation (drug discovery) and robotics (instruction following), as highlighted in the task description. The potential for improved performance, cross-domain transfer, and interpretable subgoals offers considerable impact."
