    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for bridging theory and practice in SSL, focusing on theoretical foundations, sample complexity, comparative analysis, and cross-modality applicability. It elaborates comprehensively on the research idea, detailing the plan to derive comparative bounds and validate them empirically. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself to fill the gaps identified in the literature review, such as the lack of unified sample complexity analysis for contrastive vs. non-contrastive methods and the quantification of design choice impacts across modalities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are specific and measurable (deriving bounds, empirical validation, practical guidelines). The methodology section logically separates theory, implementation, and experiments, providing sufficient detail (loss functions, theoretical approach using Rademacher complexity, architectures, datasets, metrics, controls). The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist only in the condensed presentation of the exact theoretical derivation steps and the precise quantification of 'augmentation complexity', which is acceptable for a proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing theoretical tools (statistical learning theory, Rademacher complexity) and acknowledging prior work on SSL theory and empirical studies, its core contributions are novel: 1) A unified theoretical framework specifically for *comparing* sample complexity bounds of contrastive and non-contrastive SSL. 2) A systematic theoretical and empirical investigation into how design choices (augmentations, architecture) quantitatively affect these bounds. 3) Extending this comparative analysis rigorously across multiple modalities (vision, language, time-series). These aspects directly address identified gaps and offer fresh perspectives beyond existing single-paradigm analyses or purely empirical comparisons."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on solid theoretical foundations in statistical learning theory (generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity) and cites relevant recent work. The proposed methodology for both theoretical derivation and empirical validation is logical and well-justified, employing standard techniques. Assumptions (like spectral gaps) are acknowledged. The experimental design is comprehensive, including multiple modalities, data regimes, relevant metrics, and control experiments. Minor weaknesses include the inherent difficulty of deriving tight bounds for deep networks and rigorously incorporating factors like augmentation complexity, but the overall approach is technically sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. The theoretical derivations, while conceptually sound, can be technically demanding, especially achieving tight bounds. The empirical plan is extensive, requiring significant computational resources (GPU time for training large models across multiple datasets, data sizes, and seeds) and careful implementation to ensure fair comparisons. Access to standard datasets and model implementations is straightforward. The project scope is ambitious, likely requiring substantial time and resources. However, within a well-equipped research setting, the plan is generally realistic, with manageable risks primarily related to theoretical difficulty and computational cost."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in SSL: understanding and comparing the sample efficiency of dominant paradigms (contrastive vs. non-contrastive). Providing theoretical bounds and empirical validation for sample complexity across different modalities would offer substantial practical value, guiding practitioners in resource allocation and model selection, especially in data-limited domains. Theoretically, it contributes to a deeper understanding of SSL mechanisms. The potential to inspire new, more sample-efficient algorithms further enhances its significance."
