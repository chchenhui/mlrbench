    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core goal of bridging the theory-practice gap in SSL, focusing specifically on sample complexity â€“ a key topic mentioned in the task description. The proposal accurately reflects the research idea by aiming to derive and compare bounds for contrastive vs. non-contrastive methods, considering factors like augmentation and architecture, and validating across multiple modalities (vision, language, time-series). It also explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the need for theoretical understanding of sample complexity and comparing SSL paradigms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The introduction clearly motivates the problem, the objectives are well-defined, and the overall research plan (literature review, theory, validation) is logical. The empirical methodology (datasets, architectures, evaluation) is reasonably specified. However, the 'Mathematical Formulations' section lacks depth. The provided formulas are overly generic placeholders for sample complexity bounds and do not detail how specific aspects of SSL (e.g., contrastive/non-contrastive loss functions, augmentation strategies, latent geometry) will be incorporated into the theoretical analysis using statistical learning theory tools like Rademacher complexity or norm-based bounds. More detail on the specific theoretical techniques and derivations is needed for complete clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers good novelty. While theoretical analysis of SSL exists (as shown in the literature review, e.g., generalization bounds, duality), this proposal specifically focuses on deriving and *comparing sample complexity bounds* for contrastive versus non-contrastive methods. It further proposes to incorporate factors like augmentation strength and architecture into these bounds and validate them empirically across multiple modalities (vision, language, time-series). This specific comparative focus on sample complexity across paradigms and modalities, aiming for practical guidelines, distinguishes it from the cited works which focus more on generalization or theoretical equivalence under specific conditions. It's not entirely groundbreaking (uses existing theoretical tools) but addresses a specific, under-explored, and important angle."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal's conceptual soundness is satisfactory, relying on established tools from statistical learning theory (Rademacher complexity, norm-based bounds) and a standard research design (theory + validation). The literature review identifies relevant prior work and challenges. However, the technical soundness is weakened by the lack of detail in the theoretical methodology. Deriving tight and meaningful sample complexity bounds for deep SSL models that account for factors like data augmentation is highly non-trivial. The generic formulas provided do not demonstrate a clear strategy for tackling these complexities. The proposal needs to elaborate on the specific theoretical techniques to be employed and how they will handle the intricacies of different SSL losses and deep network properties to provide confidence in the rigor of the planned theoretical derivations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The empirical validation part of the proposal is largely feasible, involving standard datasets, architectures, and evaluation procedures common in SSL research. However, the theoretical analysis part presents significant feasibility challenges. Deriving rigorous sample complexity bounds that are tight enough to be practically informative and accurately capture the influence of various factors (augmentation, architecture) for complex deep learning models used in SSL is known to be extremely difficult. There's a considerable risk that the derived bounds might be too loose or rely on unrealistic assumptions, limiting their practical value. The ambition to cover multiple modalities adds complexity, though the empirical part remains doable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the field of self-supervised learning. Understanding the sample complexity of different SSL paradigms is crucial for both theoretical advancement and practical application, particularly in guiding model selection and resource allocation in data-constrained scenarios. Successfully deriving comparative bounds and validating them empirically across modalities would provide valuable insights, directly contributing to bridging the theory-practice gap highlighted in the task description. The potential impact includes more efficient use of SSL, better model design, and potentially inspiring new, more sample-efficient algorithms."
