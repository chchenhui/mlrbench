        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core goal of bridging the theory-practice gap in SSL, focusing specifically on sample complexity, a key topic mentioned in the task description. It systematically plans to compare contrastive and non-contrastive methods as suggested by the research idea and highlighted as a challenge in the literature review (e.g., duality, comparative analysis). The methodology incorporates theoretical analysis and empirical validation across multiple modalities (vision, language, time-series), fulfilling the requirements outlined in the task description and idea. It explicitly references and aims to build upon relevant work cited in the literature review (e.g., Garrido et al. on duality)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the research aims. The methodology section is logically structured into theoretical framework development, empirical validation, implementation details (including pseudo-code), and practical guideline formulation. Objectives, datasets, models, methods, experimental design, and evaluation metrics are specified precisely. The mathematical formulations, while standard, are clearly presented. The expected outcomes and impact are articulated concisely and persuasively. The overall structure is easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While building upon existing theoretical concepts (generalization bounds, duality between methods), its primary contribution – developing a unified theoretical framework for *sample complexity bounds* comparing contrastive and non-contrastive SSL and *systematically validating* these across multiple modalities (vision, language, time-series) – is original. It directly tackles the challenge of understanding sample complexity identified in the literature. The plan to derive practical guidelines based on this unified theoretical-empirical analysis further enhances its novelty. It's not proposing entirely new mathematical tools but rather a novel synthesis and application focused on comparative sample complexity."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It grounds its theoretical approach in established fields like statistical learning theory and information theory, referencing relevant literature. The proposed mathematical formalizations for SSL losses and generalization bounds are appropriate. The empirical methodology is comprehensive and well-designed, covering multiple datasets, architectures, SSL methods, and evaluation metrics. The plan to connect theoretical factors (architecture, augmentation) to empirical results is logical. However, deriving tight, non-vacuous sample complexity bounds for deep neural networks is inherently challenging, which introduces a degree of uncertainty regarding the full success of the theoretical component. The technical formulations are correct at the presented level, but the core theoretical derivations remain the main challenge."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. The empirical validation plan, while extensive, uses standard datasets and models and is achievable with sufficient computational resources (which could be a bottleneck). Implementing the SSL methods and evaluation pipelines is standard practice. The main feasibility challenge lies in the theoretical analysis; deriving meaningful sample complexity bounds for complex SSL setups with deep networks is difficult and may require significant theoretical innovation or strong assumptions. The scope covering multiple modalities and methods adds to the workload. Overall, it's feasible for a well-resourced group with strong theoretical and empirical expertise, but the theoretical breakthroughs are not guaranteed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Understanding the sample complexity of SSL methods is a fundamental problem with substantial practical implications. Providing theoretical bounds and empirical validation comparing contrastive and non-contrastive approaches would offer crucial guidance for practitioners choosing methods based on data availability, potentially democratizing SSL for low-resource domains. The research could lead to more resource-efficient model development and inspire new algorithms optimized for sample efficiency. It directly addresses a critical gap highlighted by the task description and literature, promising impactful contributions to both the theory and practice of representation learning."
