    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description's goal of bridging theory and practice in SSL, specifically addressing sample complexity and comparative analysis. It perfectly elaborates on the research idea, detailing the plan to derive and validate sample complexity bounds for contrastive vs. non-contrastive methods. Furthermore, it effectively integrates the literature review, acknowledging prior work (Hieu et al., Garrido et al., Balestriero & LeCun) and positioning the research to tackle explicitly mentioned challenges like sample complexity, paradigm differences, and cross-modality applicability."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The research objectives are explicitly listed and easy to understand. The methodology section provides a good overview of both the theoretical approach (formalizing losses, identifying potential tools like Rademacher complexity, stability) and the extensive empirical plan (datasets, algorithms, experimental design, metrics). The structure is logical, flowing from background to objectives, methods, and expected outcomes. Minor ambiguity exists regarding the final choice of theoretical tools, which is acceptable at the proposal stage, but prevents a perfect score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While comparisons between contrastive and non-contrastive SSL exist (Garrido et al., Balestriero & LeCun), the specific focus on deriving *comparative sample complexity bounds* and validating them empirically across multiple modalities (vision, NLP, time-series) represents a novel contribution. It directly addresses a gap highlighted in the literature (Hieu et al. focused on contrastive generalization but not comparative sample complexity). The combination of targeted theoretical analysis and broad empirical validation enhances its innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in SSL principles and proposes using established statistical learning theory tools. The methodology outlines a logical approach combining theoretical derivation with empirical validation using standard benchmarks and algorithms. The inclusion of loss function formalizations indicates technical understanding. However, deriving tight and meaningful sample complexity bounds for deep SSL models is inherently challenging, and the proposal acknowledges this by listing potential tools rather than a guaranteed path. The success of the theoretical part relies on overcoming these known difficulties, slightly tempering the soundness score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. The empirical component, involving pre-training multiple SSL models (SimCLR, BYOL, DINO, etc.) on large datasets (ImageNet, Wikipedia) across three modalities with varying data subsets, is computationally very intensive and requires significant resources, though conceptually straightforward. The theoretical component is more uncertain; deriving novel, informative bounds is difficult and depends heavily on theoretical insight and tractability. The multi-modal scope adds complexity to management and execution. Overall, it's feasible with adequate resources and expertise, but the theoretical aspect carries inherent risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the sample complexity of different SSL paradigms is a critical open question with major practical implications, as emphasized in the task description. Providing theoretical insights and empirical evidence on when to prefer contrastive vs. non-contrastive methods based on data availability would offer substantial value to practitioners, guiding resource allocation and model selection. It directly addresses the theory-practice gap and has the potential to influence future SSL algorithm design towards improved sample efficiency."
