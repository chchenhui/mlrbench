        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for bridging the gap between theory and practice in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), focusing on theoretical foundations, sample complexity, theory-driven design, and comparative analysis of auxiliary tasks. The idea directly addresses these points by proposing a theoretical framework using information theory and statistical learning theory to analyze and compare auxiliary tasks, investigate sample complexity, and provide practical guidelines, matching the workshop's core themes precisely."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (lack of theoretical understanding in SSL), outlines a structured methodology (formalization, theoretical analysis, empirical validation), specifies the theoretical tools to be used (information theory, statistical learning theory), and lists expected outcomes and potential impact. The breakdown into steps makes the research plan immediately understandable. Minor ambiguity might exist in the exact form of the 'theoretical model' before development, but the overall concept and approach are exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While theoretical analysis of machine learning isn't new, the specific focus on developing a comparative theoretical framework for *different* SSL auxiliary tasks using tools like information theory and statistical learning theory to derive effectiveness conditions and sample complexity bounds is innovative. The task description itself notes the lack of theoretical grounding in much SSL research. This work aims to directly fill that gap in a structured way, offering fresh perspectives beyond purely empirical comparisons or single-method analyses."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant challenges, particularly in the theoretical analysis phase. Deriving rigorous theoretical conditions and bounds for complex SSL tasks and deep neural networks is notoriously difficult and often requires strong simplifying assumptions that might limit the generality of the findings. Success heavily depends on deep theoretical expertise. The empirical validation component is standard but can be computationally intensive. While ambitious, it's not impossible, placing it in the 'Satisfactory' range, acknowledging the considerable effort and potential theoretical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of why certain SSL auxiliary tasks outperform others is a fundamental and critical question in the field, as highlighted by the workshop's call. A successful execution could lead to major advancements, enabling more principled design of SSL methods, potentially improving sample efficiency and performance. The practical guidelines derived from theory would be invaluable for researchers and practitioners across various domains where SSL is applied."
