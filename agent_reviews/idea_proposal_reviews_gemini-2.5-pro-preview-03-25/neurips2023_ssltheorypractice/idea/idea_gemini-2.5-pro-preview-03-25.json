        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly asks 'Practically, where do self-supervised models shine compared to traditional supervised models?' and lists 'Comparative analysis of SSL and supervised approaches' as a key topic. The proposed idea directly addresses this by systematically comparing SSL and supervised learning under varying conditions of data scarcity and domain shift, aiming to characterize SSL's practical advantages. This fits perfectly within the workshop's goal of bridging the gap between SSL theory and practice by investigating practical use-cases."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (understanding practical SSL benefits), the main methodology (systematic empirical comparison varying data quantity and domain shift), the scope (diverse tasks like image classification, NLP), and the expected outcome (a quantitative map for practical guidance) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It is immediately understandable what the research aims to do and why."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While comparisons between SSL and supervised learning exist, and the benefits of SSL in low-data or domain shift scenarios are known anecdotally or through specific examples, this proposal offers novelty through its systematic and rigorous approach. The aim to create a 'quantitative map' by varying *both* data scarcity *and* domain shift magnitude across diverse tasks represents a more comprehensive and structured investigation than typical studies. It's not proposing a new SSL algorithm, but the methodological approach to characterizing the practical performance envelope of SSL vs. supervised learning offers notable originality."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible using existing SSL models, supervised baselines, datasets, and evaluation protocols. Standard techniques exist for subsetting data and simulating domain shifts. However, the proposed systematic study across diverse tasks, multiple levels of data scarcity, and varying degrees of domain shift implies a very large number of experiments. This requires significant computational resources (especially for SSL pre-training and numerous fine-tuning/training runs) and careful experimental design and management. While technically possible, the scale presents a moderate implementation challenge."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the precise conditions under which the substantial cost of SSL pre-training yields tangible benefits over standard supervised learning, particularly in challenging but common scenarios like data scarcity and domain shift, is a critical practical question. The results could provide clear guidance for practitioners on model selection, justifying the use of SSL, and potentially influencing how SSL models are developed and deployed. It directly contributes valuable practical knowledge, aligning with the workshop's aim to connect theory and practice."
