    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop on Gaze Meets ML), the research idea (Self-Supervised Feature Prioritization via Gaze), and the literature review. It directly addresses key workshop topics like unsupervised ML using eye gaze, attention mechanisms, and applications in radiology. The methodology clearly builds upon the research idea, aiming to use gaze for feature prioritization via contrastive learning. It explicitly references and aims to improve upon methods mentioned in the literature review (McGIP, FocusContrast, GazeGNN) and addresses some of the highlighted challenges (e.g., variability, integration). The objectives, methods, and expected outcomes are all tightly linked to the initial idea and the context provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section details the datasets, preprocessing steps (with formula), model architecture (Siamese network, attention module), loss functions (with formulae), and experimental design (baselines, metrics, ablations). The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise architecture of the 'lightweight convolutional network' for attention or the exact sampling strategy for negative non-attended regions, but these do not significantly hinder understanding. Overall, the proposal is well-articulated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building upon existing work in gaze-guided contrastive learning (McGIP, FocusContrast cited in the literature review), it proposes a distinct approach. Specifically, the idea of explicitly contrasting gaze-attended regions against non-attended regions within the same image using a learned attention module, rather than relying on similar gaze patterns across images (McGIP) or using gaze primarily for augmentation (FocusContrast), presents a novel formulation. The direct integration without necessarily needing binary masks or GNNs (like GazeGNN) also adds to the novelty. It's an innovative combination and refinement of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of self-supervised learning (contrastive learning, Siamese networks) and leverages a plausible hypothesis about the link between gaze and relevance in medical imaging. The proposed methodology, including heatmap generation, attention mechanisms, and contrastive loss, is technically well-founded. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, standard evaluation metrics, ablation studies, and ethical considerations. The technical formulations provided appear correct. Minor gaps might exist in justifying the optional reconstruction loss or detailing the attention module, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It plans to use publicly available datasets (MIMIC-CXR, OpenI, NIH) with existing gaze data, mitigating major data collection hurdles. The proposed techniques (CNNs, ViTs, contrastive learning, attention) are standard in deep learning and implementable with current libraries and hardware (though requiring significant computation). The plan includes standard evaluation procedures. While access to a private dataset requires IRB approval, this is a standard process. The main risks relate to achieving superior performance over strong baselines, but the core research activities are feasible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: reducing the need for expensive annotations in medical AI while improving performance and interpretability. Leveraging radiologists' gaze as a form of weak supervision has the potential for substantial impact, particularly in low-data scenarios or resource-limited settings. Success could lead to more data-efficient model training, enhanced trust through interpretable attention maps aligned with clinical workflows, and potentially reduced costs in AI development. The potential to bridge cognitive science and ML further adds to its significance."
