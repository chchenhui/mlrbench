    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for using eye-gaze for ML supervision, specifically focusing on unsupervised feature importance in radiology, which is a listed topic of interest. The methodology closely follows the research idea, proposing a self-supervised contrastive learning framework guided by radiologists' gaze. It also appropriately situates itself within the context of the provided literature review, referencing similar recent works (McGIP, FocusContrast) and acknowledging relevant challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is partially clear but suffers from significant ambiguity in the methodology section. While the overall goal and framework are understandable, the description of the 'Auxiliary Contrastive Loss' (Step 3) is confusing. It uses the exact same formula as the main contrastive loss (Step 2) but claims to contrast gaze-attended regions with non-attended regions. This discrepancy makes it unclear how the auxiliary loss actually functions or differs from the main loss, suggesting either a copy-paste error or a poorly explained mechanism. This lack of clarity in a core component of the proposed method hinders a complete understanding."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal has minimal originality beyond existing work cited in the literature review. The core concept of using radiologists' gaze patterns within a contrastive learning framework for medical image pre-training is explicitly described in the McGIP (2023) and FocusContrast (2023) papers. The proposal's main contrastive learning approach appears very similar to McGIP. The potential novelty might lie in the 'auxiliary contrastive loss' targeting attended vs. non-attended regions, but this aspect is poorly defined and its distinction from prior work isn't clearly articulated or justified. The proposal largely presents an application of recently published ideas rather than introducing a significantly new method or perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, based on the reasonable premise of using gaze as weak supervision and employing established self-supervised techniques like contrastive learning. The general approach aligns with recent literature. However, the technical description lacks rigor, particularly concerning the auxiliary contrastive loss. Presenting an identical formula for two supposedly different loss functions (main and auxiliary) is a significant weakness, suggesting either a flaw in the proposed method's description or a lack of careful technical formulation. While the overall concept is plausible, this specific methodological ambiguity undermines the proposal's technical soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces a significant challenge regarding data acquisition. It relies on 'large-scale eye-tracking datasets from radiologists,' the limited availability of which is noted as a key challenge in the literature review. The proposal does not specify the source of this data or a plan to acquire it, making this a major uncertainty. Assuming data access, the implementation using standard deep learning frameworks (CNNs/Transformers, contrastive learning) is technically feasible with appropriate computational resources and expertise. However, the dependency on potentially scarce data lowers the feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in medical AI: the high cost of expert annotation and the need for better unsupervised learning methods that align with clinical reasoning. Leveraging eye-gaze data offers a promising avenue to improve model performance, generalizability in low-data settings, and interpretability/trustworthiness. If successful, the research could have a substantial impact on medical image analysis by reducing annotation dependency and making AI models more aligned with expert workflows, contributing meaningfully to the field and the goals outlined in the workshop task description."
