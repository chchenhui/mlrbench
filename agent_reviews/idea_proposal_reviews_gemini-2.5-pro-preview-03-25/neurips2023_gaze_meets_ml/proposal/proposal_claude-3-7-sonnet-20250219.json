    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for integrating eye gaze into machine learning, specifically for supervision, attention mechanisms, and unsupervised learning in a radiology application. It elaborates significantly on the core research idea, proposing a concrete framework (GazAT). Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (McGIP, FocusContrast), positioning itself appropriately within the current research landscape and acknowledging key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from introduction and motivation to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The core concepts (gaze-to-attention conversion, gaze-guided contrastive learning, attention transfer, regional contrastive loss) are explained well, and the experimental design is comprehensive. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise formulation of the gaze-guided augmentation transform (T_g) and the region selection for the regional contrastive loss. The mention of a conceptual Figure 1, which is not provided, slightly hinders full clarity. However, the overall proposal is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing concepts like contrastive learning and gaze-guided augmentation (similar to FocusContrast), it introduces novel components, particularly the multi-level attention transfer mechanism (\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{attn}) to explicitly align model and human attention maps, and the regional contrastive loss (\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{regional}) to focus learning on high-attention areas. This combination and the specific integration mechanisms differentiate it from the cited works (McGIP, FocusContrast, GazeGNN). It represents a more comprehensive framework for leveraging gaze data in self-supervised learning rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of self-supervised contrastive learning and attention mechanisms. The proposed methods for gaze processing, augmentation, attention transfer (using standard distance metrics), and combined loss optimization are technically plausible and well-justified. The mathematical formulations presented are appropriate. The experimental design is thorough, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies, indicating methodological rigor. Minor weaknesses include the potential complexity of tuning the multi-objective loss and the inherent assumption that gaze patterns perfectly capture all relevant features, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing public datasets with gaze data (REFLACX), mitigating a major bottleneck. The proposed methods utilize standard deep learning architectures and techniques (CNNs/ViTs, contrastive learning, Grad-CAM) that are implementable with current libraries and hardware (though requiring significant compute resources). The plan for limited data collection is realistic. The experimental plan is ambitious but achievable. Key risks involve data availability for other modalities and potential difficulties in hyperparameter tuning, but these are common research challenges and do not render the proposal infeasible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles critical challenges in medical AI, including the high cost of annotation, the need for interpretability, and the desire to align AI models with clinical reasoning. By leveraging radiologists' gaze as implicit supervision, it offers a promising path towards more data-efficient, trustworthy, and clinically relevant AI systems. Success could lead to substantial improvements in representation learning, transfer learning for low-data regimes, and AI-assisted diagnostics. The potential contributions to both machine learning methodology and clinical practice are substantial."
