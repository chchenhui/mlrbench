        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on 'Unsupervised ML using eye gaze information for feature importance/selection', which is the core focus of this idea. It also relates to other listed topics like 'Annotation and ML supervision with eye-gaze' (using gaze as implicit supervision), 'Attention mechanisms and their correlation with eye-gaze', and 'Eye gaze used for AI'. The idea directly addresses the workshop's goal of driving progress in gaze-assisted machine learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (linking gaze statistics from multiple observers to feature relevance via an unsupervised model), and expected outcomes are well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise definition of 'input regions/features' across different data modalities and the specific architecture of the proposed model (though mentioning contrastive/generative provides direction). However, for a research proposal, the level of detail is good and the core idea is easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While using eye gaze in ML is established, particularly for saliency or supervised tasks, applying it specifically for *unsupervised feature relevance discovery* by modeling *consistent gaze patterns across multiple observers* is less common. It proposes a novel way to leverage implicit human attention signals for feature importance without task labels, moving beyond standard statistical unsupervised methods or supervised gaze-based approaches. It combines existing elements (gaze tracking, unsupervised learning, feature importance) in a fresh configuration."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Collecting eye-gaze data from multiple observers is achievable with current eye-tracking technology, although it can be resource-intensive. Defining features/regions (e.g., image patches, text tokens) and aggregating gaze statistics (fixations, density) are standard procedures. Developing unsupervised models like contrastive or generative ones is common practice in ML. The main potential challenge lies in acquiring sufficient high-quality, diverse gaze data across multiple observers and datasets to train a robust model and ensure generalizability. However, the core technical components are within reach."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Unsupervised feature relevance discovery is a fundamental challenge in ML, especially for complex, high-dimensional data where labels are scarce. Leveraging human gaze provides a potentially more intuitive and perceptually grounded approach compared to purely data-driven statistical methods. Success could lead to improved performance in downstream unsupervised and few-shot learning tasks, better data understanding, and potentially enhanced model interpretability by highlighting features humans deem important. It addresses a key aspect of human-centric AI and the goals of the workshop."
