        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Gaze Meets ML' by proposing a framework to integrate eye gaze data into machine learning models. It explicitly mentions key topics from the call for papers, including integrating eye gaze into ML (CV, NLP, RL), enhancing human-AI interaction, addressing ethical considerations, and targeting relevant application domains (radiology, AR/VR, autonomous driving). The idea aims to bridge human cognition and AI using gaze data, which is the central goal of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main idea, expected outcomes, and potential impact are clearly stated. The methodology is broken down into logical steps. However, some steps, like 'Develop novel feature engineering techniques' and 'Integrate the engineered eye gaze features', are described at a high level. While sufficient for an initial idea description, specifying the types of features or integration strategies envisioned would further enhance clarity. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Integrating eye gaze into ML is an established research area, as acknowledged by the workshop call. The novelty likely lies in the specific proposed framework, the 'novel feature engineering techniques' mentioned but not detailed, and the comprehensive application across multiple ML fields (CV, NLP, RL) and domains (radiology, AR/VR, autonomous driving) within a unified approach. It combines existing concepts effectively but doesn't appear to introduce a fundamentally groundbreaking paradigm shift based on the description provided. The contribution seems more focused on synthesis, specific technical innovations within the framework, and broad application."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The proposed steps involving preprocessing, feature engineering, model integration, and evaluation are standard ML research practices. Integrating features into existing models (CV, NLP, RL) is technically achievable. The main challenge lies in Step 1: 'Collect large-scale eye-tracking data from various domains'. This requires significant resources, time, specialized equipment, and access to participants/data across diverse fields like radiology, AR/VR, and autonomous driving. If existing datasets can be leveraged, feasibility increases. Assuming data access or collection resources are available, the rest of the plan is practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Enhancing ML model performance and interpretability, improving human-AI interaction, and better understanding human cognition using eye gaze are important research goals. The targeted application domains (healthcare, autonomous systems, HCI, AR/VR) are areas where such advancements could have substantial real-world benefits. Successfully bridging human attention mechanisms and AI perception aligns well with major trends in AI research and could lead to meaningful contributions."
