        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses multiple topics of interest, including 'Unsupervised ML using eye gaze information for feature importance/selection', 'Annotation and ML supervision with eye-gaze', 'Attention mechanisms and their correlation with eye-gaze', and 'Gaze applications in... radiology... autonomous cars'. The motivation aligns precisely with the workshop's goal of using cost-efficient gaze signals to bridge human cognition and AI, reducing annotation needs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, overall goal, and main components (neuro-symbolic approach, gaze metrics, attention module, RL agent) are described. However, the specifics of the 'symbolic reasoning modules' (how rules are encoded and applied) and the exact mechanism of the 'reinforcement learning agent' for dynamic feature selection lack detail. Further elaboration on the interaction between the symbolic and neural components would enhance precision."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using gaze for weak supervision or attention guidance exists, the proposed combination of a neuro-symbolic framework (using symbolic rules derived from gaze to guide neural attention) specifically coupled with a reinforcement learning agent for dynamic unsupervised feature selection appears innovative. This integrated approach, aiming to balance task accuracy with gaze alignment for feature selection, offers a fresh perspective compared to existing methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology. Eye-tracking data collection is established, and neural attention mechanisms are standard. However, implementing the neuro-symbolic integration requires careful design, especially the symbolic rule engine. The reinforcement learning component for dynamic feature selection adds complexity, demanding thoughtful state/action/reward design and potentially significant tuning. Integrating these diverse components poses moderate engineering challenges, but it is achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. It tackles the critical issue of expensive data annotation by leveraging low-cost gaze data for unsupervised feature selection. Success could lead to more efficient model training, particularly in data-scarce domains like medical imaging. Furthermore, linking feature selection to human gaze patterns promises enhanced model interpretability and contributes to the broader goal of aligning AI with human cognition, which is highly relevant to the workshop's theme and ML research."
