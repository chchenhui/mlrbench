        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on 'Unsupervised ML using eye gaze information for feature importance/selection', 'Annotation and ML supervision with eye-gaze', 'Attention mechanisms and their correlation with eye-gaze', and 'Gaze applications in ... radiology'. The proposed research directly addresses these topics by using radiologist gaze patterns for self-supervised feature prioritization in medical imaging, aiming to improve unsupervised learning and align model attention with expert focus. It fits squarely within the workshop's scope and goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (bridging the gap in unsupervised medical image analysis using gaze), the main technical approach (self-supervised contrastive learning guided by gaze heatmaps), and the expected outcomes (improved accuracy, interpretability, trust) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The core concept of contrasting gaze-attended vs. non-attended regions is immediately understandable. Minor details about the specific contrastive loss function could be elaborated, but the overall idea is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using gaze data in ML and self-supervised learning are established areas, the specific combination of using radiologists' gaze patterns as a signal for *self-supervised feature prioritization* via *contrastive learning* between attended and non-attended regions in medical imaging is innovative. It moves beyond simple saliency prediction or direct supervision, proposing a novel way to implicitly encode clinical relevance into unsupervised feature representations by leveraging natural expert attention patterns. This specific formulation offers a fresh perspective on using gaze for weak supervision in a challenging domain."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but depends significantly on data availability and quality. Access to large-scale, high-quality eye-tracking datasets from radiologists performing diagnostic tasks is crucial and might be challenging to obtain or require specific collaborations (though some public datasets are emerging). Technical implementation using contrastive learning frameworks on CNNs or Transformers is standard practice in ML research. Potential challenges include noise in gaze data, variability between experts, and ensuring accurate alignment between gaze and image features. Assuming data access, the technical implementation is well within current capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of learning clinically relevant features from medical images without expensive annotations. Potential impacts include: 1) Improving the performance of unsupervised anomaly detection models. 2) Enhancing model interpretability by aligning AI attention with expert gaze patterns, fostering trust. 3) Reducing reliance on labeled data, which is a major bottleneck in medical AI. 4) Potentially improving generalization in low-data settings. Success would represent a major advancement in unsupervised medical image analysis and human-aligned AI."
