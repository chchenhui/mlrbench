    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly lists 'How to align scientific foundation models with scientific facts without hallucination?' as a key challenge under the 'Challenges' topic. The proposed idea directly addresses this challenge by suggesting a method (knowledge-infused fine-tuning) to improve factual consistency and reduce hallucinations in foundation models applied to science. It fits squarely within the workshop's theme of integrating foundation models and AI-for-Science."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (scientific hallucinations), the proposed method (fine-tuning with curated knowledge and a consistency loss), the mechanism (knowledge bases like KGs/rules, auxiliary loss), and the expected outcome (fact-aligned, trustworthy models). The core concept is immediately understandable with no significant ambiguity. Minor details about the exact loss formulation or knowledge representation are unspecified, but this is expected at the idea stage."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While fine-tuning foundation models and knowledge infusion techniques (like using KGs) exist independently, applying them specifically to enforce consistency with diverse scientific facts (physical laws, chemical rules, biological pathways) within large foundation models using a dedicated consistency loss is a relatively novel approach. It combines existing concepts in a targeted way to address a specific, challenging problem in the scientific domain, offering a fresh perspective compared to general-purpose fine-tuning or fact-checking."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core challenge lies in curating comprehensive, accurate, and machine-readable scientific knowledge bases across potentially diverse scientific domains. Representing complex scientific principles (e.g., differential equations, intricate biological pathways) effectively as knowledge graphs or logical rules suitable for calculating a loss function is non-trivial. While the fine-tuning process itself is standard ML practice, the knowledge curation and representation steps require considerable effort, domain expertise, and potentially new techniques, making implementation challenging but not impossible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the factual inconsistency and hallucination problem in foundation models is critical for their reliable adoption in scientific research, where accuracy and adherence to established principles are paramount. Successfully aligning models with scientific facts would dramatically increase their trustworthiness and utility for tasks like hypothesis generation, scientific literature review, data interpretation, and experimental design, potentially leading to major advancements in AI-driven scientific discovery."
