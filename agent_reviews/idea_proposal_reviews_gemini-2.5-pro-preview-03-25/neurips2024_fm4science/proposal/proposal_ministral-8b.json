    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of 'How to quantify the scientific uncertainty of foundation models?' explicitly mentioned in the task description. The methodology outlined (Bayesian framework, VI, priors, calibration, visualization) is a direct expansion of the research idea. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates concepts, methods (BNNs, VI, domain priors), and acknowledged challenges (scalability, calibration, interpretability) highlighted in the provided literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It presents a logical structure with distinct sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The objectives are clearly stated, and the steps within the methodology (research design, algorithms, experiments) are generally well-defined. The inclusion of mathematical formulas for VI and ECE adds precision, although the specific ECE formula might need adaptation depending on the exact scientific task (e.g., regression vs. classification). Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact nature/scale of the 'foundation models' to be used and the specific scalable VI techniques, but overall clarity is good."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the core techniques (Bayesian Neural Networks, Variational Inference, domain-specific priors, calibration metrics, visualization) are established in the UQ and SciML literature (as evidenced by the review), the novelty lies in their specific synthesis and application to quantify uncertainty in the emerging area of large-scale *scientific foundation models*. It addresses a novel and important problem setting. The development of calibration metrics and visualization tools *specifically tailored* for scientific applications and diverse domains could represent a more distinct novel contribution. However, it doesn't propose fundamentally new UQ algorithms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on solid theoretical foundations in Bayesian statistics and machine learning (BNNs, VI). The proposed methodology is appropriate for the problem of UQ. The plan to incorporate domain knowledge via priors is theoretically sound, though practical implementation can be complex. The experimental design is comprehensive, including benchmarking, case studies, sensitivity analysis, and user studies, indicating rigor. The technical formulation for VI is correct; the ECE formula is standard for classification calibration but might need adjustment for regression tasks common in science, which is a minor point in the overall sound approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The primary challenge is scaling Bayesian methods, particularly variational inference, to potentially massive scientific foundation models, which requires substantial computational resources and potentially advanced algorithmic adaptations (as noted in the literature review). Collecting and curating diverse, large-scale scientific datasets across multiple specified domains is also a major undertaking. While the steps are logical, the successful execution depends heavily on overcoming these scalability and data acquisition hurdles, making the feasibility satisfactory but uncertain without more detail on resources and specific scalable VI methods."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck—the lack of reliable uncertainty quantification—that currently hinders the trustworthy application of powerful foundation models in high-stakes scientific research. Providing reliable UQ, as proposed, would greatly enhance the utility and credibility of AI in scientific discovery, potentially accelerating progress across multiple fields (astrophysics, biomedicine, etc.). The focus on interpretability for domain scientists further boosts its potential impact."
