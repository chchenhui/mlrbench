    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of 'how to quantify the scientific uncertainty of foundation models' raised in the task description. It faithfully expands on the core concepts outlined in the research idea (Bayesian framework, domain priors, calibration, visualization). Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as scalability of Bayesian methods, integration of domain knowledge, calibration, and interpretability, positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section is logically structured, detailing the data, the core Bayesian framework components (VI, priors, calibration, visualization) with appropriate technical notation (ELBO, SCS), and a clear experimental design including tasks, baselines, and metrics. Expected outcomes and impact are specific. The language is precise and easy to understand, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Bayesian methods for UQ are established (as shown in the literature review), the novelty lies in developing a *scalable framework specifically tailored for scientific foundation models*, integrating domain-specific constraints as priors within this context, and proposing scientifically relevant calibration metrics (SCS) and visualization tools. It combines existing concepts (BNNs, VI, domain priors) in a novel way to address the unique challenges of UQ for large-scale SFMs, distinguishing it from general UQ libraries or methods applied to smaller models. The synthesis and specific adaptations for SFMs constitute the main innovative contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon well-established theoretical foundations (Bayesian inference, variational inference). The proposed methodology (SGVI, structured variational families, domain-specific priors, calibration techniques) represents standard and advanced practices in Bayesian deep learning and UQ research. The inclusion of specific benchmark tasks, relevant baselines (including recent methods like IB-UQ and NeuralUQ from the literature review), and comprehensive evaluation metrics strengthens its rigor. The technical formulation (ELBO) is correct. While the effectiveness of the proposed SCS metric and the precise implementation of domain priors require empirical validation, the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. The main hurdle is the scalability of Bayesian methods (specifically VI) to large foundation models, which the proposal acknowledges and plans to address using structured approximations â€“ a reasonable but non-trivial approach. Access to large-scale scientific datasets and significant computational resources is implicitly required. Integrating diverse domain knowledge (physical laws) as effective priors can be complex. The 3-year timeline is ambitious but plausible for the scope of work, including software development (SciUQ-Torch, UncertaintyVis). Overall, it's feasible with appropriate resources and expertise, but technical risks related to scalability and prior implementation exist."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the lack of reliable uncertainty quantification in scientific foundation models, which hinders their adoption in high-stakes scientific research. Successfully developing such a framework would greatly enhance the trustworthiness and utility of SFMs across various scientific domains (materials science, climate, physics, chemistry), potentially accelerating discovery. The methodological advancements in scalable Bayesian inference and domain knowledge integration, along with the open-source tools, would also represent substantial contributions to the broader machine learning and SciML communities."
