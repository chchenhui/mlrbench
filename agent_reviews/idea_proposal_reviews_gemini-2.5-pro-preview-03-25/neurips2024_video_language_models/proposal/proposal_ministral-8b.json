        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the task (temporal nature, active sensing, representation learning for touch) and the workshop's goals. The methodology precisely implements the research idea (joint SSL and RL for temporal representations and active exploration). Furthermore, it is well-grounded in the provided literature, citing relevant recent work on active tactile exploration, contrastive learning, temporal modeling, and datasets, and explicitly aims to tackle the identified key challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall framework, and evaluation plan are understandable. The contrastive learning module is described reasonably well with the loss function specified. However, the methodology lacks specific details regarding the data collection process (scale, sensors, protocols). The description of the RL agent could be more precise; the reward function is vaguely defined as maximizing 'information gain' without specifying how this is measured or implemented, and the policy formulation provided seems more aligned with Q-learning's Boltzmann policy than a typical REINFORCE implementation, suggesting a minor lack of precision. The structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing the joint learning of temporal-aware tactile representations (via temporal contrastive learning) and active exploration policies (via RL) specifically for uni-modal tactile data. While individual components (active exploration with RL, contrastive learning for touch, temporal models) exist in the literature (as reviewed), their integration into a single, end-to-end framework focused on leveraging temporal coherence for representation learning while simultaneously optimizing exploration strategy appears novel. It extends beyond simply applying existing methods by combining them in a synergistic way to address the specific challenges of active tactile perception."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, based on established techniques like contrastive learning (InfoNCE), temporal modeling (TCN/RNN), and reinforcement learning (policy gradients). The core concept of using temporal coherence for SSL and RL for active exploration is logical. However, there are weaknesses: the RL reward function lacks a concrete definition, which is critical for success. There's a minor inconsistency or lack of clarity in describing the RL policy update mechanism (referencing Q-values while mentioning REINFORCE). The challenges of jointly training SSL and RL components (stability, convergence) are not explicitly addressed. These gaps slightly undermine the methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Implementing the SSL and RL algorithms is standard, but collecting a 'large-scale' tactile dataset is a major undertaking requiring substantial resources (hardware, time) and planning, which are not detailed. Training an RL agent for active exploration, potentially involving real-world interaction, is known to be sample-inefficient and difficult to tune, especially when coupled with representation learning. The proposal does not specify the availability of required resources (robots, sensors, compute) or provide a detailed plan for data collection and experimentation, making the overall feasibility questionable without further clarification."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant and timely problem in robotics and AI: understanding touch through computational methods. It tackles key limitations like the lack of labeled data and the need to model temporal dynamics and active sensing. If successful, the research could lead to more capable robotic systems (manipulation), improved prosthetics, and advancements in haptic interfaces. The development of a novel framework, benchmarks, and potentially a large dataset would be valuable contributions to the field, aligning well with the goals of the workshop and the broader research community."
