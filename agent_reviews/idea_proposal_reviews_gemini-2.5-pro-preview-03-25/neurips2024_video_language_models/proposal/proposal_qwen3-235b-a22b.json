        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of 'making sense of touch' by focusing on computational approaches for representation learning, acknowledging the temporal and active nature of touch. It proposes creating a large dataset and tools, aligning with the workshop topics. The methodology directly implements the research idea (temporal contrastive learning + RL for active exploration). It also explicitly tackles key challenges identified in the literature review, such as limited labeled data (via self-supervision), modeling temporal dynamics, developing active exploration strategies, and aiming for cross-sensor generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology is broken down into logical components (data collection, TACR, EL, evaluation) with specific architectures (3D-Conformer), algorithms (PPO+LSA), loss functions (Dynamic InfoNCE), and evaluation protocols detailed. Equations are provided for key components. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise implementation details of the inverse dynamics model for the reward function or the specifics of 'latent-space adaptation' in PPO, but these do not significantly hinder overall understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining temporal-aware self-supervised learning (specifically using a 3D-Conformer and temporal contrastive loss) with reinforcement learning for active tactile exploration. While individual components like contrastive learning for touch, RL for active sensing, and temporal modeling exist in the literature (as reviewed), their specific integration within the TACR-EL framework, particularly the joint focus on temporal coherence and RL-driven information gain for tactile data, offers a fresh perspective. The proposed large-scale dataset (TouchAct-200k) with diverse active interactions also contributes to novelty if it significantly expands on existing resources."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in self-supervised learning (contrastive methods), reinforcement learning (PPO), and deep learning for sequential data (3D-Conformers). The methodology is well-justified, referencing established techniques. The proposed data collection plan, encoder architecture, loss function, MDP formulation, and evaluation strategy are technically appropriate. Technical formulations (equations) are provided and appear correct conceptually. Minor gaps exist in specifying all implementation details (e.g., the exact form of the uncertainty estimation for the reward), but the overall approach is robust and well-grounded in relevant literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The primary challenge is the creation of the large-scale TouchAct-200k dataset (200 materials, 100 interactions/material, 2 sensors), which requires substantial time, effort, and a robust robotic setup. Training the 3D-Conformer and the RL agent, especially with a joint strategy, will demand considerable computational resources (GPUs) and careful tuning. While the individual technical components are implementable using standard libraries, the scale of data collection and the complexity of integrating and training the full system pose moderate risks to successful and timely completion."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical, unresolved challenges in tactile perception: learning from unlabeled data, modeling temporal dynamics, and incorporating active sensing. Success would lead to major advancements in robotic manipulation (especially in unstructured settings), prosthetics, and haptics by enabling more robust and data-efficient tactile understanding. The planned open-source release of the large-scale TouchAct-200k dataset and the TACR-EL framework would be a substantial contribution to the research community, lowering the barrier to entry and facilitating reproducible research, directly aligning with the workshop's goals."
