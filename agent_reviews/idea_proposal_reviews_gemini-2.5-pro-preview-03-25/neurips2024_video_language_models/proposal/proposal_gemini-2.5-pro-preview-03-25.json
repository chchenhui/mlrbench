    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on computational touch processing, representation learning, datasets, and community building. The methodology faithfully implements the core research idea of jointly learning temporal representations via SSL and active exploration policies via RL. Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review (data scarcity, temporal dynamics, active exploration, noise, generalization) and positions itself clearly relative to the cited works."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear, well-defined, and logically structured. The background, research gap, objectives, methodology (AT-TCE framework, TCLM, AEM, data collection, evaluation), and expected outcomes are articulated with precision and minimal ambiguity. Key concepts are introduced and explained effectively, and the technical details provided are sufficient for understanding the proposed approach. The writing style is professional and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. While leveraging existing concepts like contrastive learning and reinforcement learning (as identified in the literature review [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10]), the core novelty lies in the proposed synergistic integration within the AT-TCE framework. Specifically, the joint learning of temporal-aware tactile representations and active exploration policies, driven by intrinsic rewards derived directly from the self-supervised learning process (e.g., representation change, contrastive loss), represents a significant departure from prior work that typically addresses SSL and active exploration separately or uses task-specific rewards for exploration. This unified, self-supervised active learning loop is a novel contribution to tactile perception."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in self-supervised contrastive learning (InfoNCE) and model-free reinforcement learning (SAC/PPO). The methodological choices (e.g., temporal encoders like TCN/RNN/3D CNN, contrastive loss formulation, RL state/action spaces, intrinsic reward components) are well-justified and appropriate for the problem. The technical formulations (e.g., InfoNCE equation) are correct. The planned data collection and comprehensive evaluation strategy, including strong baselines and relevant metrics, further enhance the proposal's rigor. Potential challenges like joint training stability and reward tuning are acknowledged as research questions rather than fundamental flaws."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology, standard robotics hardware (arm, tactile sensor), and deep learning frameworks. The required expertise (robotics, SSL, RL) is standard for research labs in this area. The implementation of the AT-TCE framework components is achievable. However, the plan is ambitious. Collecting a large-scale, diverse active tactile dataset (LATID) requires significant time and effort. Furthermore, successfully training the joint AT-TCE system and tuning the intrinsic reward function presents a non-trivial research challenge that carries inherent risks regarding stability and convergence. While challenging, the plan is generally realistic for a well-resourced research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical bottlenecks in tactile processing, namely the reliance on labeled data [Lit Review Challenge 1] and the need to model the temporal [Lit Review Challenge 3] and active nature of touch [Lit Review Challenge 4]. Success would lead to more robust and data-efficient tactile representations, potentially enabling significant advancements in robotic manipulation, prosthetics, and HRI, aligning well with the workshop's stated application areas. Furthermore, the planned release of the large-scale LATID dataset and open-source code [Workshop Call] represents a major contribution to the community, lowering the barrier to entry and fostering future research, directly supporting the workshop's goals."
