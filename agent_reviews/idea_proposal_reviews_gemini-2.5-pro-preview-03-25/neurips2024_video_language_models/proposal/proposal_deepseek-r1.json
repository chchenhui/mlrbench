        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on computational touch processing, representation learning, datasets, and tools, while tackling the specific challenges of temporal dynamics and active sensing mentioned in the call. It faithfully expands on the core research idea, detailing the proposed SSL and RL components. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, citing relevant recent papers (e.g., AcTExplore, Contrastive Touch-to-Touch, M2CURL) and explicitly aiming to address the key challenges identified, such as label scarcity (via SSL), temporal modeling (via CNN-LSTM), and active exploration (via RL)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and easy to understand. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the data collection process, the SSL framework (including architecture and loss function), the RL formulation (state, action, reward, algorithm), and the experimental design (baselines, tasks, metrics, ablations). Technical formulations like the NT-Xent loss and PPO objective are included. The structure is logical, flowing from introduction to methods, outcomes, and conclusion. The language is precise and technically accurate, making the proposal readily comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing a unified framework that integrates temporal-aware self-supervised learning (specifically contrastive learning on sequences using CNN-LSTM) with reinforcement learning for active tactile exploration. While SSL and RL for tactile sensing exist separately (as evidenced by the literature review), their tight integration, with a specific focus on leveraging *temporal coherence* in the SSL part to inform the *active exploration* policy, represents a novel synthesis. The specific architecture choices and the combined reward structure for RL contribute to the originality. It clearly differentiates itself from cited works like M2CURL (multimodal focus) and Contrastive Touch-to-Touch (cross-sensor focus)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations in self-supervised learning (contrastive methods like NT-Xent), sequence modeling (CNN-LSTM), and reinforcement learning (PPO). The choice of methods is well-justified by the nature of tactile data (spatiotemporal, active). The methodology is detailed and robust, including specific architectural choices, loss functions, and RL components. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, diverse evaluation tasks, standard metrics, and planned ablation studies. The technical formulations provided are correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required hardware (robot arm, GelSight sensor) and software tools (ML libraries, PyBullet) are standard in robotics research labs. The proposed methods (CNN-LSTM, contrastive learning, PPO) are well-established and implementable. Data collection across 100+ materials is ambitious but achievable with robotic automation. Training deep SSL and RL models is computationally intensive but standard practice. Potential challenges include the time required for extensive data collection and the complexity of tuning the combined SSL-RL system, but these appear manageable within a typical research project scope. The plan is realistic."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses critical and timely challenges in computational touch processing â€“ namely, learning from unlabeled temporal data and incorporating active sensing. Success would represent a major advancement in enabling robots to understand and interact with the world through touch more effectively. The potential impact spans robotics (manipulation, agriculture), medical technology (prosthetics), and fundamental AI research. Furthermore, the explicit commitment to releasing a large-scale dataset, code, and benchmarks significantly amplifies the potential impact by lowering entry barriers and fostering community growth, directly aligning with the workshop's goals."
