        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned: developing computational approaches for touch data (using self-supervised learning and RL), learning representations from touch (temporal-aware tactile representations), tackling the unique challenges of touch like temporal components and active sensing, potentially contributing a large-scale tactile dataset, and providing tools/libraries (open-source tools). The focus on making sense of touch through AI/ML methods is central to both the idea and the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (limitations of existing methods, data scarcity), the core proposal (joint learning of representations and active exploration policy), the specific methods (contrastive learning, RL), the hypothesis, and expected outcomes (benchmarks, insights, tools) are articulated concisely and logically. There is minimal ambiguity, making the research direction immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While self-supervised learning and RL are known techniques, their application to jointly learn temporal tactile representations *and* active exploration policies specifically for touch sensing is innovative. It moves beyond passive tactile sensing or supervised methods by integrating active interaction directly into the representation learning loop via RL, addressing a key challenge highlighted in the task description. The combination of temporal contrastive learning and RL-driven active exploration for this modality offers a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core ML techniques (contrastive learning, RL) are established. However, collecting a *new large-scale* tactile dataset involving diverse materials and *active* interactions is a substantial undertaking requiring significant hardware setup, time, and effort. Designing and training the joint representation learning and RL system can be complex, requiring careful reward engineering for the RL agent (maximizing 'information gain') and potentially large computational resources. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation, especially data collection, poses considerable hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses fundamental challenges in tactile processing: handling temporal dynamics, incorporating the active nature of touch, and overcoming labeled data scarcity via self-supervision. Success would lead to more robust tactile understanding, directly benefiting fields like robotic manipulation, prosthetics, and haptic interfaces, as mentioned in both the idea and the workshop description. Providing benchmarks and open-source tools would also be a major contribution to the growing touch processing community, lowering the entry barrier as desired by the workshop."
