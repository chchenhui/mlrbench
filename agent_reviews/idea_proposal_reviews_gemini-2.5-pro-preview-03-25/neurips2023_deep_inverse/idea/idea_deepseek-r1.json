        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses one of the key topics explicitly mentioned in the workshop call: 'Fundamental approaches to address model uncertainty in learning-based solutions for inverse problems' where 'we only have access to partial information about the system model'. The focus on robustness, uncertainty quantification, and trustworthiness also aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of developing 'more effective, reliable, and trustworthy learning-based solutions'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem (limitations of DL assuming precise models). The proposed hybrid approach (physics-based decoder + BNN for residual uncertainty) is explained concisely. The use of variational inference for training the BNN and the target evaluation domains (MRI, CT) are specified. The expected outcomes (robustness, uncertainty-aware reconstructions) are clearly articulated. Minor details about the specific BNN architecture could be added, but the core concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While hybrid physics-DL models and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for uncertainty quantification exist separately, the specific proposal to use a BNN *within* a hybrid framework to explicitly model and quantify the uncertainty arising from *unknown or misspecified parts of the forward physics model* is innovative. It moves beyond standard uncertainty quantification (which often focuses on prediction uncertainty or noise) to tackle model uncertainty directly in a structured way for inverse problems. This specific combination and application offer a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Physics-based components (like Fourier transforms) are well-understood. BNNs and variational inference are established techniques in the ML community, supported by existing libraries. Suitable datasets for MRI and CT reconstruction exist or can be simulated. Potential challenges include the computational cost and potential complexity of training BNNs effectively (convergence, hyperparameter tuning) and integrating the physics and BNN components seamlessly, but these are considered manageable research/engineering challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing model uncertainty and the lack of robustness is a critical bottleneck for deploying deep learning methods in real-world, safety-critical inverse problems like medical imaging or non-destructive testing. Providing reliable uncertainty quantification alongside reconstructions enhances trustworthiness. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in the practical applicability and reliability of DL-based inverse problem solvers, directly contributing to the workshop's goals."
