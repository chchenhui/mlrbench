        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on 'Fundamental approaches to address model uncertainty in learning-based solutions for inverse problems' where only partial information about the system model is available. The proposed idea directly tackles this by aiming to learn the forward operator and inverse solution jointly when the forward model is uncertain, perfectly matching this key topic."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It explains the motivation (limitations of assuming known forward models), the core mechanism (adversarial framework for joint learning), the components (generator for forward/inverse models, discriminator for data fidelity, physical regularization), and the validation plan. However, some details regarding the specific architecture of the generator co-designing both models, the precise nature of the adversarial loss, and how physical constraints are integrated could be elaborated further for perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While using deep learning for inverse problems, learning forward models, and employing adversarial training are individually established concepts, the proposed approach of *jointly* learning both the forward operator approximation and the inverse mapping within a single end-to-end adversarial framework specifically to handle model uncertainty appears innovative. It offers a fresh perspective compared to methods that learn priors assuming a known forward model or methods that learn forward models separately."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Adversarial frameworks (GANs) are well-established, as are deep learning models for image reconstruction (inverse problems). The components like generators, discriminators, and incorporating regularization are standard techniques. The main challenge lies in the complexity and stability of jointly training the forward model approximation and the reconstruction network simultaneously within the adversarial setup. Ensuring convergence to meaningful solutions might require careful architectural design and hyperparameter tuning. Accessing or simulating MRI/CT data with model uncertainty is standard practice in the field."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Model uncertainty is a major practical limitation for applying deep learning to real-world inverse problems where the physics or measurement process is not perfectly known or stable. Successfully developing a method that robustly handles such uncertainty, as proposed, would be a major advancement. It could significantly improve the reliability and applicability of deep learning solutions in critical domains like medical imaging, geophysics, and non-destructive testing, reducing the reliance on precise system calibration."
