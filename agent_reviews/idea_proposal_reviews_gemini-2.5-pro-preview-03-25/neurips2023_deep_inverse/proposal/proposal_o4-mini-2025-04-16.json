    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of model uncertainty in DL-based inverse problems, which is a key topic for the workshop. It fully embodies the research idea of using meta-learning across a distribution of forward models. Furthermore, it explicitly references the provided literature, positions itself relative to that work, and aims to fill the identified gaps (lack of meta-learning across distributions, proactive robustness training vs. post-hoc UQ, efficiency)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed and logically follow from the introduction. The methodology section clearly outlines the problem formulation, the MAML-based meta-learning approach, the proposed network architectures (unrolled networks and diffusion priors), datasets, and a detailed experimental plan including baselines and metrics. The notation is consistent and the overall structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor details, like the exact adaptation mechanism for diffusion priors, could be slightly more elaborated, but the overall concept is immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by applying a meta-learning framework (specifically MAML-style) to train deep inverse problem solvers for robustness across a *distribution* of forward models. While meta-learning and robust inverse solvers exist separately, their combination for this specific purpose, aiming for fast adaptation and good average-case performance over a known uncertainty distribution p(\\\\theta), is novel. The literature review confirms that prior work focused on adapting to single unknown mismatches or quantifying uncertainty for fixed models, rather than meta-learning across a distribution. The proposed application to both unrolled networks and diffusion priors further adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in inverse problems, deep learning (unrolled networks, diffusion models), and meta-learning (MAML). The proposed methodology is robust, leveraging a standard meta-learning algorithm and relevant network architectures. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines (drawn from the literature review), standard metrics, statistical validation, and clear implementation details. The technical formulations presented are correct and clearly explained. The plan includes theoretical analysis, adding to the rigor. The assumption of a known p(\\\\theta) is acknowledged and reasonable for initiating this line of research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on existing and well-understood technologies (PyTorch, MAML, CNNs, Diffusion Models) and standard computational resources (GPUs). The proposed datasets are either standard benchmarks or involve simulating perturbations on existing data, which is common practice. While meta-learning can be computationally intensive and sometimes tricky to optimize, the described setup (batch sizes, iterations) seems manageable within a typical research environment. The main challenges (optimization tuning, theoretical analysis) are standard research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and practical limitation of current state-of-the-art deep learning solvers for inverse problems: their sensitivity to forward model mismatch. Developing solvers robust to such uncertainty, as proposed, would significantly enhance their reliability and trustworthiness, paving the way for broader adoption in high-stakes applications like medical imaging and geophysics. The potential contributions—novel algorithms, improved performance, theoretical insights, and an open-source benchmark—are substantial and directly address a key need highlighted in the workshop's call for participation."
