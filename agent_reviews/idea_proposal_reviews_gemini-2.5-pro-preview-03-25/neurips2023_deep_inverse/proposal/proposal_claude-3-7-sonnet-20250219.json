    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly consistent with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of 'model uncertainty in learning-based solutions for inverse problems' highlighted in the workshop task description. The methodology precisely implements the research idea of using a meta-learning framework to train solvers robust to a distribution of forward models. It acknowledges the challenges (model mismatch, UQ) mentioned in the literature review and proposes a distinct meta-learning approach, while also incorporating relevant concepts like diffusion priors mentioned in both the task description and literature review. The alignment is excellent across all provided context materials."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from introduction and problem formulation to methodology, experiments, and impact. Key concepts like forward model uncertainty, the meta-learning objective, and the MARISE architecture components are explained well. The experimental plan is specific. However, some minor ambiguities exist: the exact nature and acquisition of the forward model conditioning vector 'c_theta' could be more detailed, especially the 'proxy features' aspect. Additionally, while Objective 4 mentions developing theoretical guarantees, the methodology section does not detail how these guarantees will be derived, leaving that aspect less clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While meta-learning and deep learning for inverse problems are established fields, the specific application of meta-learning to explicitly learn robustness against a *distribution* of forward models, framed as learning to adapt across 'tasks' defined by different forward operators, is a novel approach in this context. The proposed MARISE architecture (Base Net, Encoder, Adaptation Net) tailored for this purpose and the combination with adaptive regularization strategies (like consistency regularization across models or using diffusion priors within this meta-learning framework) offer fresh perspectives distinct from the methods cited in the literature review (e.g., untrained blocks, Bayesian NNs, PINNs)."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid foundations of inverse problem theory, deep learning, and meta-learning. The mathematical formulation of the problem and the meta-learning objective is correct. The proposed MARISE architecture is plausible, and the meta-training procedure follows established patterns. The sampling strategies for forward model uncertainty are logical. However, the soundness score is slightly reduced because the crucial aspect of accurately defining and sampling the distribution p(theta) is acknowledged but presents significant practical challenges that might affect the method's robustness guarantees. Furthermore, the objective of providing theoretical guarantees is not supported by any proposed methodology, making the soundness of achieving that specific objective questionable within the current proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology but presents notable implementation challenges. Accessing datasets and implementing U-Nets, meta-learning algorithms, and diffusion models are standard practices. However, the meta-training procedure involving multiple forward models per batch will be computationally very expensive. Accurately modeling and sampling from the forward model uncertainty distribution p(theta), especially for structural and data-driven variations, requires careful design and potentially significant effort. Training the complex three-part MARISE network might face optimization difficulties. Achieving meaningful theoretical guarantees (Objective 4) is often very difficult for complex deep learning systems and lacks a proposed pathway here. Overall, it's feasible but requires significant resources, expertise, and careful engineering."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the field of deep learning for inverse problems. Robustness to forward model uncertainty is a major bottleneck limiting the real-world applicability and trustworthiness of current state-of-the-art methods, particularly in critical domains like medical imaging. Successfully developing such robust solvers would have a substantial impact, leading to more reliable algorithms, potentially reducing calibration needs, and improving generalization across different devices or conditions. The research aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals and broader trends towards trustworthy AI. The potential contributions are substantial and clearly articulated."
