    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of forward model uncertainty mentioned in the task description and research idea. The proposed meta-learning approach is a direct implementation of the research idea. The proposal acknowledges the limitations of current methods (reliance on precise forward models) and aims to develop robust solutions, fitting perfectly with the workshop's theme. It also implicitly connects to the literature review by identifying similar challenges (model mismatch, generalization) and proposing a distinct approach compared to the cited papers (which focus more on UQ or specific model corrections)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, the core meta-learning idea (training across a distribution of models), and the experimental plan (metrics, baselines) are well-defined. The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist: the specific meta-learning algorithm isn't named, the exact nature of the 'predefined uncertainty distribution' could be more detailed, and the 'Data Collection' section is slightly vague about sourcing real-world data vs. simulation. However, the overall concept and plan are easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While meta-learning is an existing technique, its specific application to train inverse problem solvers for robustness across a *distribution* of forward models appears novel compared to the cited literature, which focuses on UQ, untrained components, or PINNs. The idea of optimizing for average performance over a family of models via meta-learning to achieve robustness is a fresh perspective in this context. It's not entirely groundbreaking (as it leverages existing meta-learning concepts) but offers a distinct approach to the model uncertainty problem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. The core idea leverages the well-established meta-learning paradigm. The motivation (addressing model uncertainty) is well-grounded in the literature and practical needs. The proposed methodology (episodic training on sampled models, meta-objective) is conceptually sound. The experimental design includes relevant metrics and appropriate baselines (including PINNs mentioned in the literature). The mathematical formulation, while high-level, correctly captures the meta-objective. Minor improvements could include specifying the type of meta-learning algorithm and detailing the loss function, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Implementing meta-learning for deep inverse problem solvers is computationally intensive due to nested optimization loops and potentially large models/datasets. Defining and realistically sampling from the 'uncertainty distribution' for complex forward models requires careful design and domain knowledge. Access to significant computational resources is necessary. While challenging, it is achievable within a research setting, especially using simulated uncertainties on standard datasets, as implied by the proposal. The risks related to computational cost and defining the distribution are manageable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Forward model uncertainty is a major bottleneck for the practical deployment of deep learning-based inverse problem solvers in critical domains like medical imaging and geophysics, as highlighted by the task description. Developing solvers robust to such uncertainties would be a major advancement, enhancing reliability and trustworthiness. Success would have substantial impact across multiple scientific and engineering fields. The potential to create a generalizable framework for model uncertainty further increases its significance."
