    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of model uncertainty in learning-based inverse problems mentioned in the task description. It fully elaborates on the proposed meta-learning idea for robustness against forward model distribution. Furthermore, it effectively integrates concepts and methods from the provided literature review (e.g., untrained blocks from Guan et al. 2024, normalizing flows for UQ from Khorashadizadeh et al. 2022) and acknowledges the key challenges identified therein."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The use of MAML, the network architecture choices, and the experimental plan are clearly explained. Minor points like the exact definition of the physics regularizer or the forward model distribution could be slightly more detailed, and there's a minor typo ('to develop to develop'), but these do not significantly hinder understanding. The overall structure is excellent and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by applying a meta-learning framework (specifically MAML) to tackle forward model uncertainty across a *distribution* of models in inverse problems. While meta-learning and robustness techniques exist separately, their combination for this specific purpose, integrated with physics-informed components (untrained blocks) and advanced UQ (normalizing flows), offers a fresh perspective distinct from the cited prior work which focuses on single model mismatch adaptation or UQ without meta-learning for distributional robustness."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (meta-learning, inverse problems, UQ) and established methods (MAML, U-Nets, normalizing flows). The methodology is well-justified, leveraging recent relevant literature appropriately (Guan et al., Khorashadizadeh et al.). The technical formulation of MAML is correct. The integration of physics-based regularization and specific network architectures is logical. The acknowledgment of limitations (computational cost, theory) further strengthens its soundness. The slightly odd PINNs [2025] citation is a minor point that doesn't detract significantly from the overall technical rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology (DL frameworks, simulation tools) but presents notable implementation challenges. Meta-learning, particularly MAML, is computationally intensive, requiring significant resources, especially when combined with complex simulations for task generation and potentially complex network architectures (U-Net + flows). Defining and sampling from a realistic forward model distribution P(A) could also be challenging. While achievable in a research setting, the computational overhead is a significant factor impacting practicality and scalability, which the proposal rightly acknowledges as a limitation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized limitation of current deep learning methods for inverse problems: their sensitivity to forward model mismatch. Improving robustness against model uncertainty would substantially enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of these methods, enabling wider adoption in safety-critical domains like medical imaging and geophysics, directly aligning with the goals stated in the task description. The potential contributions to robust, uncertainty-aware, and adaptive solvers are substantial."
