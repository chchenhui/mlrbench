    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses key themes such as 'data-scarcity', 'limited computational resource', and methods for 'generating training data within data scarce settings' (specifically mentioning 'model-based pre-labeling' which aligns with the idea's 'model-based techniques to predict missing labels'). It targets relevant sectors (healthcare, agriculture) and explicitly includes analysis of 'fairness, explainability' and 'societal and policy impacts', all of which are highlighted topics in the task description for PML4LRS."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (data/compute scarcity), the core proposal (lightweight model for label prediction/augmentation), target domains, and expected outcomes are clearly stated. However, the exact mechanism of 'predicting missing labels' could be slightly more specific (e.g., mentioning pseudo-labeling, self-training, or a specific architecture) for perfect clarity. Overall, it is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. Data augmentation and using models for pseudo-labeling are existing concepts. The novelty lies primarily in the specific focus on *lightweight* models for this purpose, explicitly tailored for *low-resource computational environments*, and the integration of this technical approach with domain-specific applications (healthcare, agriculture in developing countries) and societal considerations (fairness, policy). It's more of a novel application and synthesis of existing ideas for a specific, important context rather than a fundamentally new algorithmic breakthrough."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Training small, efficient models is practical with current technology. Techniques like pseudo-labeling or self-training for augmentation are implementable. The explicit goal of minimizing computational requirements enhances its feasibility in the target low-resource settings. Potential challenges might involve accessing relevant datasets in developing countries and navigating deployment logistics, but the core technical methodology appears sound and achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the dual challenge of data scarcity and limited computational resources is critical for democratizing ML in developing countries. Enabling better model performance in vital sectors like healthcare and agriculture could lead to substantial real-world benefits. The focus on responsible deployment (fairness, explainability, societal impact) further increases its significance in the target context."
