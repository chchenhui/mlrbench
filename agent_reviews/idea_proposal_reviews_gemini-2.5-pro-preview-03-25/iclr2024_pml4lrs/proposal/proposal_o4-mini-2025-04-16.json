    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Practical ML for Limited/Low Resource Settings), the research idea (SynDA combining synthetic data and active learning), and the literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges mentioned in the task description, such as data scarcity, domain mismatch, computational constraints, and the need for methods like active learning and generative augmentation tailored for developing regions. The methodology builds logically upon the gaps identified in the literature review (context-aware generation under constraints, integrated acquisition functions, full pipeline evaluation). The objectives and expected outcomes are coherent with the overall goal of democratizing ML in resource-constrained environments."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (including algorithms and mathematical formulations), and experimental design are presented logically. The core concepts of context-aware generation, active learning with uncertainty and representativeness, and efficiency constraints are explained. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise implementation details of the 'context vector c', the specification of the 'proxy network' for representativeness, and the exact nature of 'prompt-guided sampling', which could benefit from slight refinement for perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like synthetic data augmentation, active learning, and model quantization exist, the novelty lies in their specific integration into a unified framework (SynDA) explicitly designed for extreme low-resource settings in developing regions. Key novel aspects include: (1) the focus on *context-aware* synthetic data generation using *lightweight* models under tight budgets, (2) the active learning strategy combining both uncertainty and *representativeness* to specifically mitigate synthetic data bias and improve domain coverage, and (3) the end-to-end optimization and evaluation considering performance, label efficiency, and computational cost simultaneously. This combination offers a fresh perspective compared to the cited works, which often focus on only parts of the problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical foundations (GANs, diffusion models, active learning, quantization). The proposed methodology, including loss functions, the active learning acquisition score combining entropy and embedding distance, and the iterative algorithm, is technically well-defined. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant tasks, strong baselines from the literature, appropriate metrics (including cost, robustness, fairness), and necessary ablation studies. Minor areas, such as the stability of training highly quantized lightweight generative models on small seed datasets and the optimal choice/training of the proxy network for representativeness, might require further empirical validation, but the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technologies and methods. The data requirements (small seed set, larger unlabeled pool) are realistic for low-resource contexts. The algorithmic steps are clearly outlined. However, achieving the ambitious goals of high performance, significant label reduction (>=50%), *and* strict resource efficiency (8GB memory, <4hrs GPU) simultaneously presents moderate challenges. Training stable and effective lightweight generative models (especially distilled diffusion) can be non-trivial. The success depends on careful implementation, tuning, and potentially overcoming unforeseen hurdles in model optimization and data quality. Therefore, while feasible, there are manageable risks affecting the degree of success."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and well-recognized challenge of applying ML in data-scarce and computationally constrained developing regions, directly aligning with the task description's goals. Successfully developing SynDA could lead to major advancements in democratizing ML by substantially reducing annotation costs and hardware requirements. The potential impact spans multiple sectors (agriculture, healthcare, governance) and includes promoting fairer, more robust, and locally relevant ML solutions. The plan to release open-source tools further amplifies its potential societal impact."
