    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (PML4LRS goals), the research idea (SynDA concept), and the literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges of low-resource settings (data scarcity, compute limits, domain mismatch) highlighted in the task description. The methodology explicitly integrates concepts from the literature review (lightweight generators [7], context-aware generation [3, 8], combining generation and AL [4, 10], hybrid AL [6]) and aims to tackle the identified key challenges [1-5]. The objectives, significance, and methodology sections consistently reinforce the core idea and its relevance to the target context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, starting with a strong motivation and clear identification of the research gap. The objectives are specific and measurable. The SynDA framework is explained in detail, including the iterative process, components (generation, AL), technical details (conditioning, AL scoring function), and training procedure. The experimental design is thoroughly outlined with specific datasets, simulation strategies, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The language is precise and technical concepts are explained well, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, although combining synthetic data generation and active learning is not entirely new [4, 10]. The novelty lies in the specific synergistic integration tailored for severe resource constraints in developing regions. Key novel aspects include: 1) The focus on *lightweight*, context-aware generative models (distilled diffusion, tiny GANs) conditioned on *minimal* local seed data and prompts. 2) The design of a hybrid active learning strategy that explicitly considers the representativeness of the *combined* real and synthetic data pool to correct potential synthetic biases. 3) The holistic integration of computational efficiency techniques (quantization, proxy models) across both the generation and active learning components. While building on existing ideas [3, 7, 8], the specific combination and optimization for the target environment represent a fresh and valuable contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon well-established ML principles (data augmentation, generative models, active learning, model optimization). The proposed methodology is logical and well-justified: using lightweight models for efficiency [7], context-aware generation for relevance [3, 8], and hybrid AL for label efficiency and diversity [6, 10]. The adaptation of representativeness sampling to the combined real+synthetic pool is theoretically sound. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines (ablations, transfer learning) and metrics (performance, efficiency, robustness, bias). Minor potential weaknesses exist, such as the challenge of generating high-quality data from minimal seeds with lightweight models and tuning the balance between components, but the plan includes investigation and empirical validation, making the overall approach robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML technology and standard research resources. It leverages existing frameworks (PyTorch, Hugging Face) and techniques (distillation, quantization, AL strategies). The assumption of small labeled seed data and larger unlabeled data pools is realistic for many low-resource scenarios. The experimental plan, while ambitious, is well-structured and implementable. Key risks include the practical effectiveness of lightweight generators from minimal seeds and the complexity of tuning the framework's hyperparameters. Evaluating on actual low-resource hardware is noted as potentially challenging but not core to validating the framework itself. Overall, the plan is realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying ML in developing regions â€“ the concurrent challenges of data scarcity, labeling costs, computational limitations, and domain relevance, as highlighted by the PML4LRS task description. If successful, the SynDA framework could provide a practical, resource-efficient methodology with substantial impact: democratizing ML, enabling locally relevant applications in critical sectors (agriculture, healthcare), reducing project costs, and advancing the field of low-resource ML. The potential to significantly reduce labeling requirements (target 50%) while maintaining performance would be a major contribution."
