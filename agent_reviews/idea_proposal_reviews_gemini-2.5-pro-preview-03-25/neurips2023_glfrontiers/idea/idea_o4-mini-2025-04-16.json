        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Foundation models for graphs and relational data' and highlights the opportunity for 'interacting with structural data with language interface'. GraphLang directly proposes such a foundation model, pretrained on diverse graph-text data, aiming to enable natural language interaction with graphs. It also touches upon 'Multimodal learning with Graphs' by combining graph and text modalities. The motivation and goals perfectly match the workshop's focus on expanding graph learning's boundaries in the era of foundation models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (making graph data accessible via NL), the core proposal (GraphLang: a multi-modal Transformer), the training data (paired graph-text corpora from diverse sources), the pretraining/fine-tuning methods (masked reconstruction, contrastive alignment, graph-to-text, instruction tuning), and the expected capabilities (zero-shot QA, interactive retrieval, editing). The concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While research exists at the intersection of graphs and language, and Transformers are used for both, the proposal for a *single, unified* foundation model pretrained across *diverse* graph types (KGs, molecules, scene graphs) specifically for *interactive language-driven querying, reasoning, and editing* is innovative. It goes beyond domain-specific models or models focused solely on QA, aiming for a more general-purpose graph-language interface. The combination of diverse data sources and multi-task pretraining/instruction tuning for broad capabilities represents a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building a large-scale multi-modal Transformer requires substantial computational resources. The primary challenge lies in curating, aligning, and processing large, diverse paired graph-text corpora from knowledge graphs, molecular datasets, and scene graphs, which is a non-trivial data engineering task. Designing effective pretraining tasks that generalize across these varied structures and semantics is also complex. While the underlying technologies exist, the scale and data requirements make it considerably resource-intensive and challenging to execute perfectly."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Enabling intuitive natural language interaction with complex graph structures would democratize access to valuable information locked in knowledge bases, molecular databases, social networks, etc. It addresses a critical usability gap for graph data. Success could lead to major advancements in how scientists, analysts, and the general public interact with and leverage graph-based knowledge, directly aligning with the workshop's goal of making graph learning a more generic and impactful tool, potentially accelerating scientific discovery."
