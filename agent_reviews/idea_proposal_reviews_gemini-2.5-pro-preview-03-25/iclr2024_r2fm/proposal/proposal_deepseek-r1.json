    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core concerns regarding FM reliability, responsibility, spurious features, hallucinations, and bias. The methodology systematically implements the two-stage pipeline outlined in the research idea (causal attribution via interventions, followed by pruning/reweighting). It appropriately positions itself relative to the cited literature (CCR, SEraser) by using them as baselines and aiming to overcome limitations like manual feature identification or test-time-only adaptation. All sections consistently reinforce the central theme of using causal interventions to mitigate spurious correlations in FMs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and logically presented. The objectives are explicit, and the methodology is broken down into understandable stages and steps. Key concepts like intervention types and evaluation metrics are clearly listed. The inclusion of formulas aids understanding. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise operationalization of the 'do-operation' P(y|\\\\text{do}(h_i)) in the context of model inference, the exact definition of the counterfactual input X' for the swapping intervention, and a more concrete definition of how positive (\\\\\\\\tilde{X}^+) and negative (\\\\\\\\tilde{X}^-) samples are generated/selected for the contrastive loss. Overall, however, the proposal is well-articulated and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While causal inference and spurious correlation mitigation are established areas, the specific approach of applying targeted interventions (masking, scaling, swapping) directly to the *hidden activations* of foundation models for causal attribution, and then using these attributions to guide both contrastive fine-tuning and weight regularization, appears innovative. It distinguishes itself from prior work like SEraser (test-time prompt tuning) and CCR (causal feature selection potentially without direct activation intervention) and regularization based on manual feature identification. The combination of these specific techniques applied to FMs constitutes a novel contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and methodologically rigorous. It builds upon established principles of causal inference (interventions) and machine learning techniques (contrastive learning, regularization). The experimental design includes relevant baselines, metrics, statistical analysis, and ablation studies. However, there are minor weaknesses. Equating high KL divergence upon intervention directly with 'spuriousness' might be an oversimplification; important causal features could also be sensitive to intervention. The practical calculation of P(y|\\\\text{do}(h_i)) needs more explicit definition. The effectiveness of these specific, relatively simple interventions (masking, scaling) in disentangling complex effects within deep non-linear models requires empirical validation. The technical formulations provided are mostly correct but rely on the conceptual soundness of the spuriousness score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning computational cost. Stage 1, involving interventions on potentially millions of hidden activations across numerous data points to compute spuriousness scores, could be prohibitively expensive for large FMs (like LLaMA). The proposal does not explicitly detail strategies to mitigate this scalability issue (e.g., sampling activations, focusing on specific layers). Stage 2 also adds computational overhead. While the datasets and base models are accessible, the required computational resources and engineering effort for the intervention and fine-tuning pipeline are substantial. The risk associated with computational cost significantly impacts feasibility."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in contemporary AI: the lack of reliability and trustworthiness in foundation models due to their reliance on spurious correlations. Successfully developing a scalable, principled method for identifying and removing these features would represent a major advancement. The potential impact is substantial, potentially leading to more robust, fair, and factual FMs suitable for high-stakes applications, directly aligning with the goals outlined in the task description. The expected outcomes (reduced hallucinations, improved OOD generalization, reduced bias) are meaningful contributions."
