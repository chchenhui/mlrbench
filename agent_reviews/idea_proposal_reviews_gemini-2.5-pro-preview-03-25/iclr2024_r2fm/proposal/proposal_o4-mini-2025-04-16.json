    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of unreliable and irresponsible behaviors (spurious features, hallucinations, bias) in Foundation Models (FMs) outlined in the task description. The methodology, focusing on causal interventions, pruning, and fine-tuning, perfectly matches the research idea. It explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (CCR, SEraser, etc.), positioning itself within the current research landscape and aiming to tackle identified challenges like automation and scalability for FMs. All sections, from introduction to expected outcomes, consistently reinforce the goal of enhancing FM reliability and responsibility through causal methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are specific, and the two-stage methodology (Causal Attribution and Intervention-Guided Pruning/Reweighting) is logically structured and explained. Key concepts like interventions (masking, scaling, swapping), the spuriousness score calculation, pruning mechanism, and the contrastive fine-tuning loss are clearly articulated, often with mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including baselines, metrics, and analysis, is well-outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise implementation details of interventions across batches or the exact criteria for layer selection for feature extraction, but these do not significantly hinder understanding. Overall, the proposal is well-written and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While causal inference, interventions, model pruning, and contrastive learning are existing concepts, the specific combination and application proposed here appear novel. Specifically, the idea of using targeted interventions (masking, scaling, swapping) directly on *hidden activations* of large FMs to derive a quantitative *spuriousness score*, followed by automated pruning and contrastive fine-tuning guided by these scores, represents a fresh approach compared to prior work focusing on manual regularization (Wang et al.), test-time adaptation (SEraser), or different causal learning frameworks (CCR). The automation aspect for large FMs is a key distinguishing factor. It's not entirely groundbreaking but offers a distinct and innovative methodology within the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in causal inference principles (approximating do-calculus via interventions) and established machine learning techniques (pruning, contrastive learning, L1 regularization). The proposed interventions are plausible methods for probing feature effects. The definition of the spuriousness score, while heuristic (max effect), is reasonably justified. The fine-tuning objective combines standard task loss with theoretically motivated invariance and sparsity terms. The technical formulations provided are clear and appear correct. The methodology builds logically on the cited literature. While the effectiveness of the specific interventions and score needs empirical validation, the overall approach is technically sound and methodologically rigorous."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges, primarily concerning computational cost. Stage 1, involving interventions on potentially numerous features across large datasets for large FMs, requires substantial computational resources (multiple forward passes per feature). While acknowledged by the proposal's plan to report overhead, this cost might limit the scale of initial experiments or the number of features/layers analyzed. Accessing and manipulating hidden activations, pruning, and fine-tuning large FMs are technically achievable with standard deep learning frameworks but require significant engineering effort and compute infrastructure. The reliance on hyperparameter tuning (e.g., pruning threshold τ, loss weights λ) adds complexity. It's feasible in a well-resourced research setting but scalability might be a concern."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles critical and widely recognized issues in FMs: reliability (hallucinations, calibration), fairness (bias), and robustness (OOD generalization). Developing automated, generalizable methods to identify and remove spurious features would be a major advancement for responsible AI development. Success would lead to more trustworthy FMs, enhance transparency by identifying problematic internal features, and potentially inform best practices and regulatory standards. The quantified expected outcomes (e.g., 20% hallucination reduction) highlight the ambition and potential impact. The research aligns perfectly with the goals of the R2-FM workshop and addresses fundamental challenges in the field."
