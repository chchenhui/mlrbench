    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of synergizing reasoning (LLM) and decision-making (RL) for open-world agents. The objectives (architectural innovation, knowledge evolution, open-world validation) map clearly onto the research idea and the challenges highlighted in the task description (unification, adaptation, knowledge acquisition, minimal supervision, generalization). The methodology incorporates elements discussed in the literature review (LLM agents, RL, Minecraft/AppWorld environments, knowledge integration) and explicitly positions itself against cited works like WebRL and LLaMA-Rider. The key challenges identified in the literature review are directly tackled by the proposed approach, particularly the integration of reasoning/decision-making and efficient knowledge transfer via the dynamic repository and contrastive alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The architecture is broken down into understandable components (LLM, RL, Knowledge Repository) with specified functions and even model choices (LLaMA-3 65B, PPO+GNN). Key mechanisms like the contrastive alignment loss and the interaction protocol are explained with sufficient detail, including mathematical formulations where appropriate. The evaluation plan is specific, with clear baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. While minor details like the precise GNN architecture or the scale of the initial human dataset could be elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While combining LLMs and RL is an active research area (as shown in the literature review), the core novelty lies in the specific integration mechanism: the dynamic knowledge repository coupled with contrastive learning (InfoNCE loss) to achieve *bidirectional* alignment and refinement between LLM-generated subgoals and RL state representations. This approach to evolving shared knowledge and mutually improving both reasoning and execution components appears distinct from the cited works, which often focus on unidirectional influence, direct RL fine-tuning of LLMs, or curriculum learning. The emphasis on a structured, evolving knowledge graph actively mediating the interaction is a strong point of novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (LLMs for reasoning, PPO for RL, GNNs for graph/object representations, contrastive learning for alignment, knowledge graphs). The chosen methods (LLaMA-3, PPO, InfoNCE) are appropriate and state-of-the-art. The overall architecture and interaction protocol are logically designed. The experimental plan includes relevant baselines, comprehensive metrics, and necessary ablation studies to validate the core hypotheses. Technical formulations (Bellman, InfoNCE) are correctly presented. Minor potential weaknesses include the inherent complexity of stabilizing joint training and the assumption that the contrastive loss will effectively bridge the semantic gap for improved performance, which requires empirical validation (the goal of the research)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges and resource requirements. Access to large models (LLaMA-3 65B) and substantial compute resources for pretraining, RL training, and joint optimization is necessary. Implementing and integrating the complex architecture (LLM, RL, GNN, dynamic knowledge graph, contrastive learning module) requires considerable engineering effort and expertise across multiple domains. Ensuring stable and efficient joint training can be difficult. However, the chosen environments (AppWorld, Minecraft) are established platforms, and the overall plan (staged training, specific components) is realistic for a well-equipped research team. The risks associated with training stability and achieving effective alignment are manageable but non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in AI progress: creating agents that can effectively reason and act in complex, dynamic, open-world environments. Successfully unifying high-level reasoning and low-level decision-making through the proposed dynamic knowledge framework would represent a major advancement. The potential contributions – improved generalization, sample efficiency, emergent capabilities, and reduced reliance on human supervision – are substantial. The research directly tackles key questions from the workshop description and aims to outperform recent state-of-the-art methods (WebRL). Positive results would have broad implications for robotics, game AI, autonomous systems, and the fundamental understanding of hybrid cognitive architectures."
