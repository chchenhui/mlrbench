    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the workshop task: synergizing reasoning (LLM) and decision-making (RL) for open-world agents. The objectives and methodology precisely reflect the research idea, focusing on a hybrid architecture with dynamic memory and contrastive alignment. It effectively builds upon the cited literature (Chen et al., Carta et al., Feng et al., Qi et al.), positioning itself within the current research landscape and aiming to tackle the identified key challenges (integration, adaptation, knowledge transfer, minimal supervision). The chosen evaluation domains (Minecraft, robotics) are appropriate for open-world agent research."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with background and motivation, clearly stating objectives, detailing the methodology (architecture, formal definition, module specifics, training, experiments), and outlining expected outcomes. Key components like the LLM Reasoner, RL Executor, and Dynamic Memory are explained. The use of mathematical notation (e.g., for the contrastive loss) and an algorithm outline enhances clarity. Implementation details and evaluation metrics are specified. While minor details could always be added (e.g., specifics of memory retrieval beyond k-NN), the proposal is immediately understandable and unambiguous in its core aims and methods."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While combining LLMs and RL is an active research area, the specific integration strategy proposed here is novel. Key innovative aspects include: 1) The dynamic memory module that explicitly stores and retrieves experiences to inform the LLM's reasoning process for continual learning. 2) The use of contrastive learning to explicitly align the representation spaces of high-level symbolic subgoals (from LLM) and low-level state embeddings (from RL). This specific combination, aimed at seamless integration and improved generalization/sample efficiency in open worlds, distinguishes it from prior work cited, which might focus more on RL fine-tuning or specific feedback mechanisms without this explicit memory/alignment focus."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (MDPs, LLMs, RL/PPO, Contrastive Learning) and established methods. The proposed DKR2A architecture is logically coherent, and the interaction between modules is well-reasoned. The formal problem definition, RL objective, and contrastive loss function are correctly formulated. The training procedure and experimental design are appropriate. Potential challenges like training stability or memory scalability exist, but these are research risks rather than fundamental flaws in the proposed methodology. The approach is technically well-grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges and resource requirements. Integrating and jointly training large LLMs, RL agents, and a dynamic memory system is complex and requires substantial engineering effort. The specified hardware (64 TPU cores, 512 CPU workers) indicates high computational costs, limiting feasibility to well-resourced labs. Data acquisition (annotated plans, simulation experience) is also non-trivial. While the individual technical components exist, achieving stable and effective integration and training poses considerable risk and requires significant expertise and time. The ambition level makes it challenging but not impossible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical challenge in AI: creating agents capable of robust reasoning and decision-making in complex, dynamic open-world environments. This is central to achieving more general AI capabilities. Success would represent a major advancement in integrating symbolic reasoning and sub-symbolic learning, potentially leading to breakthroughs in robotics (e.g., disaster response), game AI, and autonomous workflow automation. It directly tackles key questions posed by the workshop task description and offers a potential blueprint for future research in this area."
