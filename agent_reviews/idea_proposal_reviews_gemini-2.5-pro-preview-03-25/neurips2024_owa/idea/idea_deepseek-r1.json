        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of synergizing reasoning (LLM) and decision-making (RL) for open-world agents. It explicitly tackles challenges like dynamic environments, continuous knowledge acquisition, generalization to unseen scenarios, and the role of knowledge, all mentioned as key interests or example questions in the workshop call. The proposed integration of LLMs, RL, and a dynamic knowledge graph fits perfectly within the scope of topics like interleaved reasoning/decision-making, LLMs, RL in open-world environments, open vocabulary learning, and knowledge acquisition with potentially reduced supervision."

        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation, main components (LLM, RL, Knowledge Graph), their proposed interaction, key innovations (bidirectional interface, open-vocabulary knowledge acquisition), and expected outcomes are well-defined. The overall concept is easy to grasp. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanisms of the 'bidirectional interface' (how reasoning informs exploration strategy vs. how outcomes refine reasoning priors) and the 'LLM-driven graph expansion' (specific methods for ensuring relevance and consistency). However, these are details expected to be elaborated during the research itself, and the core proposal is sufficiently clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While integrating LLMs and RL, or using knowledge graphs with RL, are existing research directions, the proposed approach combines these elements in a novel way. The emphasis on a *dynamic* knowledge graph continuously updated via environmental feedback from the RL agent and expanded in an *open-vocabulary* manner by the LLM, coupled with a *bidirectional* influence where reasoning guides action and action outcomes refine reasoning priors, represents a fresh perspective. It moves beyond using LLMs just for planning or reward shaping, aiming for a tighter, more adaptive loop suitable for open-world learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant research and engineering challenges. The core components (LLMs, model-based RL, knowledge graphs) are available. However, effectively integrating them poses difficulties: designing robust interfaces between symbolic reasoning (LLM, KG) and sub-symbolic learning (RL), managing the computational cost and scalability of a dynamic knowledge graph, developing stable training procedures for the coupled system, and creating suitable open-world benchmark environments for evaluation. While challenging, these issues seem addressable with current methods and dedicated effort, making the idea feasible but requiring substantial work."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of creating AI agents that can reason, adapt, and make decisions effectively in complex, dynamic open-world environments â€“ a major frontier in AI. Successfully integrating reasoning and decision-making with continuous knowledge acquisition could lead to major advancements in autonomous systems, robotics, game AI, and complex workflow automation. Improving generalization and reducing the need for human intervention for knowledge updates are highly valuable goals with broad applicability."
