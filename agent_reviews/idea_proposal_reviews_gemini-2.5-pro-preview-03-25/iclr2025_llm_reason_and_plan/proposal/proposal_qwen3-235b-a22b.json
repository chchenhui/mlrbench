    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key workshop topics like 'Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks' and 'Training Methodologies for Enhancing Reasoning'. The methodology precisely implements the core research idea of an Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP) using meta-reasoning (DE) and RL (PL) for dynamic resource allocation. It effectively positions itself within the cited literature, acknowledging prior work (AdaPlanner, LLM-DP, AdaLLaVA, etc.) while clearly identifying the gap it aims to fill â€“ a unified, generalizable framework for adaptive computation specifically in LLM *planning* tasks, rather than domain-specific or feedback-driven methods. The proposal directly tackles challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as dynamic allocation complexity and balancing efficiency/performance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are specific and measurable. The overall architecture (DE, RA, PL) is explained well, aided by a conceptual diagram. The core algorithmic ideas (using hidden states for difficulty, RL for policy learning, reward function) are clearly articulated. The experimental plan (benchmarks, baselines, metrics, ablations) is straightforward. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact features for the DE beyond hidden states, the specific MLP/policy network architectures, and details of the simulated environment for RL training, but these do not significantly hinder understanding of the core proposal. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like adaptive inference, meta-reasoning for difficulty, and RL for policy optimization exist in the literature (as acknowledged), the novelty lies in their specific integration into a unified 'Adaptive Inference Planner' (AIP) framework explicitly designed for general LLM planning tasks across diverse environments (ALFWorld, MiniWoB++, Meta-World). It distinguishes itself from prior work like AdaPlanner (external feedback-driven refinement) and LLM-DP (neuro-symbolic) by focusing on internal state-based difficulty assessment to dynamically control multiple LLM inference parameters (depth, tools, beam width) within the planning loop. The emphasis on generalizability across planning domains adds to its innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations: LLMs for planning, RL (specifically PPO), and the concept of adaptive computation. The proposed methodology (DE estimating difficulty, RA mapping to actions, PL learning policy via RL) is logical and technically coherent. The use of LLM hidden states as input to the DE is plausible, and PPO is a suitable algorithm for the policy learning task. The experimental design is appropriate, including relevant benchmarks, baselines, and metrics. The main assumption needing strong empirical validation is the reliability of the DE in predicting step difficulty from internal LLM states. The technical formulations are correct at a conceptual level, though specific network architectures are not detailed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing technologies (LLMs, RL libraries, standard benchmarks like ALFWorld, MiniWoB++, Meta-World). The required computational resources and expertise are typical for ML research labs. The data collection plan uses established datasets and standard augmentation/annotation techniques. The multi-stage training pipeline is complex but standard practice for such systems. Key risks include the potential inaccuracy of the Difficulty Estimator and the inherent challenges of RL training (sample efficiency, stability, tuning), but these represent research challenges rather than fundamental infeasibility. Implementation is practical with current tools."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of computational inefficiency in LLM inference, particularly for complex reasoning and planning tasks. Improving efficiency and performance through adaptive resource allocation could enable broader deployment of LLMs in real-world, resource-constrained applications like robotics and logistics. Success would represent a substantial contribution by providing a generalizable framework (AIP) for efficient planning, potentially leading to significant cost reductions and performance gains, as suggested by the ambitious quantitative targets. The research directly contributes to the workshop's goals of scalable reasoning and efficient inference, advancing a key area in LLM development."
