    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's topic on efficient inference and dynamic resource allocation for LLM reasoning/planning. It elaborates precisely on the core research idea of an 'Adaptive Inference Planner' by proposing the 'Adaptive Meta-Planning' (AMP) framework. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the concepts and papers mentioned in the literature review (e.g., adaptive planning, meta-reasoning, RL for adaptation), positioning itself clearly within the existing research landscape and aiming to tackle the identified challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section clearly outlines the components (CAM, RAC, Learning Optimizer) and their functions, supported by a conceptual diagram, formulas, and pseudocode in Section 3. The implementation details, training procedure, benchmarks, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies are specific and easy to understand. The structure is logical and facilitates comprehension. Minor details about specific network architectures or feature extraction could be elaborated further, but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the general concept of adaptive computation and dynamic resource allocation for LLMs exists and is mentioned in the literature review (particularly papers 5-10, suggesting related prior or concurrent work), the specific proposed framework (AMP) with its distinct components (CAM assessing complexity via uncertainty, linguistic cues, goal distance; RAC controlling depth, sampling, tools, verification) and the detailed RL-based optimization strategy represents a novel synthesis and concrete implementation approach for LLM planning. It's not introducing a completely new paradigm but offers a fresh, well-specified method for tackling the problem, distinguishing itself from cited works like AdaPlanner (feedback-based refinement) or AdaLLaVA (multimodal latency focus)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations, including LLM planning mechanisms (like CoT), meta-reasoning concepts, uncertainty quantification (entropy), and standard reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO). The proposed methodology is detailed and technically robust, with plausible mechanisms for complexity assessment (CAM) and resource allocation (RAC). The mathematical formulations for complexity, resource mapping, and the RL objective are appropriate and clearly presented. The comprehensive evaluation plan, including diverse benchmarks, relevant metrics, and ablation studies, further strengthens its rigor. Potential challenges in CAM accuracy or RL stability are acknowledged implicitly by the research nature, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, assuming access to necessary resources (SOTA LLMs, significant compute for RL training). The technical components (neural networks for CAM/RAC, RL libraries) are available. Integrating these components and training the system end-to-end is complex and computationally intensive but achievable within a dedicated research project. Potential risks include the difficulty in accurately assessing step complexity via CAM, potential instability in RL training, and the overhead of the adaptive mechanism itself. However, the plan is realistic, and the proposed steps (pre-training, RL fine-tuning, curriculum learning) are standard practices."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the computational inefficiency and performance limitations of LLMs in complex planning tasks due to fixed inference resource allocation. Successfully developing the AMP framework could lead to substantial improvements in computational efficiency (reducing costs and energy consumption) and planning performance (by focusing resources on critical steps). This has major implications for the practical deployment and scalability of LLM-based planning systems in robotics, decision support, and other domains. The research also contributes valuable theoretical insights into meta-reasoning and adaptive computation within LLMs."
