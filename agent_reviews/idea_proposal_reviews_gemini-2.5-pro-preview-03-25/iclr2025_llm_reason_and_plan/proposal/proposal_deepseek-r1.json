    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses Topic 2 ('Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks') and the scope item 'Efficient inference for complex reasoning tasks' from the workshop call by proposing a method for dynamic resource allocation during inference. The methodology directly implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea (meta-reasoning controller, dynamic resource allocation based on difficulty, RL training). It effectively integrates concepts and benchmarks (ALFWorld, MiniWoB++) mentioned in the provided literature (AdaPlanner, LLM-DP, AdaLLaVA, LLM-RAO), positioning itself clearly within the existing research landscape and addressing key challenges identified."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the architecture (planner, controller), data sources, training process (RL with PPO, reward function), and evaluation plan (benchmarks, metrics, baselines, ablations). The structure is logical and easy to follow. Technical aspects like the controller's input/output and the different effort modes are clearly explained. Minor ambiguities might exist in the precise implementation details of the controller network or synthetic data generation, but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While adaptive computation and dynamic resource allocation are known concepts in LLM research (as evidenced by AdaLLaVA, LLM-RAO, and placeholder papers 5-10), the specific contribution lies in the proposed integrated framework (AIP). This framework features a dedicated meta-reasoning component trained via RL to specifically select between different granularities of LLM inference strategies (greedy, CoT, beam search + tools) within planning tasks, optimizing a cost-performance trade-off. This specific combination and application to planning benchmarks, using RL for control, offers a fresh perspective compared to prior work like AdaPlanner (plan refinement) or LLM-DP (neuro-symbolic). It's an innovative integration of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations (LLM planning, meta-reasoning, RL, adaptive computation). The proposed methodology is well-justified: the two-component architecture is logical, using context/history for difficulty assessment is standard, defining discrete effort modes is a practical approach, and employing RL (PPO) with a cost-performance reward is appropriate for the optimization goal. The experimental design includes relevant benchmarks, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Potential minor weaknesses include the challenge of learning an accurate 'difficulty score' via RL and potential instability in training, but the overall technical approach is coherent and well-reasoned."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on accessible resources (open-source LLMs, standard benchmarks, compute for RL) and established techniques (fine-tuning, PPO, LLM inference). Integrating the components is technically achievable. However, the timeline appears somewhat ambitious, particularly the extension to multi-modal tasks in months 7-9. The primary risks involve the successful training and convergence of the RL agent for the meta-reasoning controller, which often requires significant tuning. Achieving the specific quantitative improvements (30-50% time reduction, 15-20% success rate increase) might also prove challenging, adding a degree of risk to meeting the stated outcomes exactly."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It tackles the critical bottleneck of computational inefficiency in LLM-based planning, which currently limits their deployment in real-time or resource-constrained applications (robotics, autonomous systems). Successfully developing AIP would represent a major advancement, enabling more scalable and practical use of LLMs for complex decision-making. The research also contributes to the broader understanding of adaptive computation and meta-reasoning in AI. Reducing computational overhead also has positive environmental and economic implications. The problem is timely and central to the advancement of LLM capabilities."
