    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core research idea of an 'Adaptive Inference Planner' (AIP) using meta-reasoning and RL for dynamic resource allocation. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's Topic 2 ('Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks') and touches upon other relevant topics like RL for optimization (Topic 1), benchmarking (Topic 3), and explainability/uncertainty (Topic 5). The proposal clearly situates itself within the provided literature, differentiating its approach from AdaPlanner (post-hoc refinement) and AdaLLaVA (multimodal focus) while building upon the concepts of adaptive computation and meta-reasoning mentioned in other cited works. There are no significant inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides a good overview with mathematical formulations for the core components (state, difficulty prediction, resource allocation, reward) and a clear algorithmic outline. The experimental design, including benchmarks, baselines, and metrics, is well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise architecture of the meta-reasoner networks (f_\\\\theta, \\\\pi_\\\\phi) and the exact mechanism for supervising the difficulty predictor f_\\\\theta, but these details are often elaborated later in the research process. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While the concepts of adaptive computation, meta-reasoning, and using RL for optimization exist in the literature (as acknowledged), the specific contribution lies in integrating these elements into a coherent 'Adaptive Inference Planner' (AIP) framework. This framework dynamically controls multiple LLM inference parameters (CoT depth, beam width, tool use) based on a learned, step-wise difficulty prediction for planning tasks, optimized via RL for a cost-performance trade-off. This specific combination and application appear distinct from the cited works like AdaPlanner and AdaLLaVA. The existence of related papers suggests the general area is active, but the proposed AIP mechanism offers a novel synthesis and application."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid foundations by formulating the problem as a sequential decision process suitable for RL. The proposed components (meta-reasoner for difficulty, policy network for resource allocation, RL optimization with a cost-aware reward) are theoretically plausible and leverage established techniques (PPO). The technical formulations provided are clear and appear correct. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant benchmarks, strong baselines, appropriate metrics, ablation studies, and statistical analysis. A minor point needing further clarification during research would be the optimal strategy for training the difficulty predictor (f_\\\\theta). "

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires access to suitable LLMs, benchmark environments, and significant computational resources for RL training. Integrating the meta-reasoner and dynamically controlling inference parameters (CoT steps, beam width, tool calls) within an LLM's generation loop requires non-trivial engineering effort. RL training itself is known to require careful tuning and can be sample-intensive. The 12-month timeline is ambitious given the technical complexity but achievable for a focused effort. Key risks involve the convergence and effectiveness of the RL training and the performance of the learned difficulty predictor."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical and timely problem of computational efficiency and scalability for LLMs performing complex reasoning and planning tasks. Reducing cost/latency while maintaining or improving performance would have a substantial impact on the practical deployment of LLMs in real-time, resource-constrained, or large-scale applications (e.g., robotics, interactive agents). The proposed AIP framework offers a general approach to adaptive inference, and success could lead to major advancements in making sophisticated LLM reasoning more practical. The potential for improved explainability through difficulty scores adds further value."
