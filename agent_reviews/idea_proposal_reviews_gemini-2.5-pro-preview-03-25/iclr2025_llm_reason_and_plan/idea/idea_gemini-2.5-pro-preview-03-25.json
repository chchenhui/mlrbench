        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses Topic 2: 'Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks', specifically the question 'How can models dynamically allocate resources during inference to optimize for reasoning and planning?'. It also incorporates elements from Topic 1 (using RL for training) and potentially touches upon Topic 5 (Uncertainty). The focus on efficient inference for LLM planning fits perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (inefficiency of fixed computation), the core concept (Adaptive Inference Planner - AIP), its mechanism (meta-reasoning, dynamic resource allocation), and the training approach (RL for efficiency) are well-explained. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation of the meta-reasoning component (how difficulty/uncertainty is assessed) and the specifics of the RL setup, but the overall research direction is clearly defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While dynamic computation exists in other ML areas, applying it specifically to LLM planning through an integrated meta-reasoning component (AIP) that dynamically allocates diverse resources (inference steps, tools, search width) based on estimated step difficulty, and training this via RL to balance cost and quality, represents a fresh and innovative approach within the LLM planning domain. It moves beyond static planning strategies often employed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Designing an effective meta-reasoning component to accurately predict step difficulty is non-trivial. Training the system using RL, especially balancing planning success and computational cost, can be complex and require significant computational resources. Integrating dynamic control over inference parameters (steps, beam width, model calls) into existing LLM architectures might also require considerable engineering effort. However, the core components (LLMs, RL, meta-learning concepts) exist, making it achievable with focused effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the critical bottleneck of computational inefficiency and performance limitations in LLM planning, especially for tasks with variable complexity. If successful, it could lead to substantial improvements in inference speed for simpler planning tasks and enhanced performance on complex ones by intelligently allocating resources. This could enable the application of LLM planning to more demanding real-world problems and represents a meaningful contribution to efficient AI."
