    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics outlined: Topic 1 (Training Methodologies) by proposing adaptive RL for enhancing reasoning in pre-training and post-training; Topic 2 (Inference Time Scaling) by including dynamic resource allocation during inference; and Topic 3 (Benchmarking) by aiming to develop a benchmark for adaptability. The focus on dynamic reasoning, adaptability, and RL aligns perfectly with the workshop's core themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is generally clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main components (adaptive RL, dynamic resources, multi-stage training), and expected outcomes are stated. However, the specifics of the 'adaptive RL algorithms' (e.g., adaptation mechanism, signals used) and the 'dynamic resource allocation' mechanism lack detail, leaving some ambiguity about the precise technical approach. Minor refinements clarifying these technical aspects would improve precision."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using RL for LLM reasoning is an active research area, the specific focus on *adaptive* RL tailored for *dynamic* reasoning tasks, combined with *dynamic* resource allocation within a multi-stage training framework, offers a fresh perspective. It's an innovative integration of existing concepts (adaptive RL, dynamic allocation) applied specifically to enhance LLM reasoning adaptability, rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training LLMs with RL is computationally intensive. Developing and stabilizing *adaptive* RL algorithms that effectively adjust strategies in real-time for complex reasoning tasks is non-trivial. Implementing dynamic resource allocation tightly coupled with the reasoning process adds another layer of technical complexity. Success would likely require substantial computational resources and expertise in both LLMs and advanced RL."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of LLMs in dynamic reasoning and long-horizon planning addresses critical limitations of current models. Success could lead to major advancements in deploying LLMs for complex, real-world tasks requiring flexible decision-making. The development of a dedicated benchmark for adaptability would also be a valuable contribution to the field."
