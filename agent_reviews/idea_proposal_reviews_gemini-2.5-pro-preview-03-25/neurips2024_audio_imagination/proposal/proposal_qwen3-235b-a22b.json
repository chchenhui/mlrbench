    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (NeurIPS Audio Imagination workshop focusing on TTS, evaluation, and responsibility), the research idea (integrating steganographic watermarking into TTS diffusion models for provenance), and the literature review (citing relevant works like XAttnMark, AudioSeal, FakeSound, and addressing key challenges identified like imperceptibility vs. robustness, integration, zero-shot detection, and benchmarking). It directly tackles the core problem outlined in the idea using methods discussed in the literature, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The introduction sets the stage effectively, the methodology details the data, model architecture (including specific mechanisms like cross-attention adaptation), training stages, and evaluation metrics. Mathematical formulations are provided for key parts. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact definition of the accuracy metric for watermark detection (BER seems more appropriate than classification accuracy) and the use of SSIM for comparing watermark bits. Some notation includes apparent typos (e.g., D_{\\phi}?, E_{\\psi}?). Overall, the proposal is well-structured and largely understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing the integration of steganographic watermarking *directly* into the denoising diffusion process for TTS, specifically adapting the cross-attention mechanism from XAttnMark (2025) for this purpose. This integration within the generation steps, rather than as a post-processing step, is a key novel aspect. It also combines this with differentiable extraction and watermark-robust encoders for zero-shot detection into a comprehensive framework. While related work exists (e.g., Diffusion-Based TTS with Integrated Watermarking, Chen et al., 2024, cited in the review), the specific proposed mechanism (cross-attention adaptation) and the holistic approach including benchmarking offer clear distinctions and fresh perspectives."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, based on established techniques like diffusion models, cross-attention, U-Nets, ResNets, and standard evaluation metrics (PESQ, STOI, FAD). The methodology is technically plausible. However, there are minor weaknesses: the choice of SSIM in the robustness loss for comparing watermark bits (w) is unconventional (BER or cosine similarity might be more standard); the definition of 'Accuracy' for watermark detection needs clarification (BER is likely intended); MSE seems misplaced as a primary watermark detection metric. The mathematical formulations appear mostly correct, but the potential typos (D_{\\phi}?, E_{\\psi}?) slightly detract. These issues seem addressable but currently represent minor gaps in rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML technology, standard datasets (VCTK, LJSpeech), and computational resources (GPUs). The outlined plan (data prep, model design, staged training, evaluation) is realistic. However, achieving the ambitious performance targets simultaneously (e.g., >=98% detection accuracy, >=40dB PSNR, >=4.0 PESQ, >=23% robustness improvement over AudioSeal, >=88% zero-shot accuracy) presents significant technical challenges and risks. Integrating the watermark directly into diffusion might impact synthesis speed or quality unexpectedly, and optimizing the complex system requires careful tuning. The project is feasible but challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the proliferation of audio deepfakes and the need for verifiable provenance in AI-generated content. Successfully developing such a framework would have substantial impact by enhancing media trustworthiness, supporting legal frameworks for AI accountability (e.g., EU AI Act), protecting against voice cloning misuse, and promoting responsible AI practices. The plan to release open-source tools and benchmarks further amplifies its potential impact on the research community and industry. The topic is critical for the future of generative audio."
