    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (NeurIPS Audio Imagination Workshop), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses key workshop topics like 'Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis', 'Methods for Evaluation of Generated Audio', 'Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music', and 'Impact of generative audio on media'. The proposal meticulously expands on the core concepts presented in the research idea, including the motivation, methodology (diffusion models, steganographic watermarking, extractor, zero-shot detector), and expected impact. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the provided literature review, citing relevant works on audio watermarking (AudioSeal, XAttnMark), diffusion models, deepfake detection (WavLM), and ethical considerations, while also positioning itself relative to the identified challenges (imperceptibility vs. robustness, integration, detection, standardization)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear, well-defined, and easy to understand. The background, motivation, and significance are articulated concisely. The research objectives are specific, measurable, and logically structured. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the overall design, data sources, algorithmic steps, and mathematical formulations (e.g., modified diffusion process, loss functions), leaving little room for ambiguity. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and clearly outlines the metrics, baselines, and experimental procedures. The structure is logical, flowing seamlessly from introduction to impact."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality and innovation. While audio watermarking for generative models is an active area of research (as shown in the literature review with AudioSeal, XAttnMark, Chen et al.), the proposal's novelty lies in the specific focus on integrating steganographic watermarking *within the latent space/generation process of diffusion-based TTS models* and, crucially, the proposed *watermark-robust encoder for zero-shot detection*. This zero-shot detection aspect, aiming to identify the watermark structure itself without the secret key, appears distinct from standard deepfake detection or key-dependent watermark extraction methods cited. The combination of these elements applied specifically to diffusion TTS offers a fresh perspective, though it builds upon existing concepts rather than being entirely groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations, leveraging established diffusion models for TTS, principles of steganography, psychoacoustics, and state-of-the-art self-supervised speech models (WavLM/HuBERT). The proposed methodology, including conditioning the diffusion process and designing extractor/detector networks, is technically plausible. The mathematical formulations for the diffusion update and loss functions are presented clearly and appear correct. The evaluation plan is rigorous, employing standard metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. A minor point reducing the score slightly is that the effectiveness of the zero-shot detection based purely on watermark structure is a strong hypothesis requiring thorough empirical validation, and achieving the desired imperceptibility/robustness/quality trade-off is inherently challenging."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and standard research resources. It relies on publicly available datasets (VCTK, LibriTTS), standard deep learning frameworks (PyTorch), and established model architectures. The research plan is well-defined and broken down into manageable steps. While training large diffusion models and fine-tuning speech encoders is computationally intensive (requiring significant GPU resources like A100s/V100s), this is standard practice in the field. The main challenges lie in the successful implementation of the integrated watermarking without significant quality degradation and achieving high robustness/detection rates, particularly for the zero-shot component. These are research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues, and the plan seems realistic for a well-resourced research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely societal problem of audio deepfakes and the associated erosion of trust in digital media. By aiming to embed verifiable provenance directly into synthetic speech generated by state-of-the-art TTS models, the research has the potential for major contributions. These include enhancing security, enabling accountability for AI-generated content, providing proactive mitigation strategies against misuse, advancing audio watermarking techniques within diffusion models, and potentially contributing to standardization efforts. The successful completion of this work could have substantial positive impacts on journalism, legal systems, content platforms, and public trust, strongly aligning with the workshop's theme of 'Responsibility in generative AI'."
