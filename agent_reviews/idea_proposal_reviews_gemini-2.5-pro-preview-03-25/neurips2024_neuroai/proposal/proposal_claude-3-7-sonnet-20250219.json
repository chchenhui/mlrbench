    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeuroAI task's focus on neuro-inspired computation, self-supervised systems (predictive coding, active inference), and efficiency. It faithfully elaborates on the research idea of using predictive coding and active inference for data-efficient RL. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (Rao et al., Ororbia et al.), positioning itself appropriately within the current research landscape and aiming to tackle the identified challenges like sample efficiency and exploration."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure, clearly defines objectives, and explains the core concepts (hierarchical predictive coding, free energy, active inference, EFE) with supporting mathematical formulations. The methodology section details the proposed architecture, learning mechanisms, action selection, and experimental plan. Minor ambiguities might exist in the specific implementation details of the neural networks or the Monte Carlo EFE estimation, but the overall research plan and rationale are understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building directly on recent work in active predictive coding and meta-representational predictive coding (cited in the literature review), it proposes a novel synthesis. Specifically, the integration of a multi-level *hierarchical* predictive coding architecture with *active inference* (via EFE minimization) for action selection, further augmented by *meta-learned adaptive precision*, represents a fresh combination aimed squarely at improving RL sample efficiency and exploration. The novelty lies more in this specific integration and application focus than in fundamentally new concepts."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established theoretical frameworks from neuroscience (predictive coding, active inference) and machine learning (variational inference, deep learning, RL). The proposed methodology, including the hierarchical structure, free energy minimization objective, EFE-based action selection, and meta-learning for precision, is conceptually coherent and well-justified. The mathematical formulations appear consistent with the underlying theories, although practical implementation relies on common approximations (e.g., Gaussian distributions). The experimental plan is appropriate for validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the components (DNNs, RL environments) are available, integrating them into the proposed complex system (multi-level hierarchy, simultaneous free energy minimization, Monte Carlo EFE estimation, meta-learning) will be computationally expensive and technically demanding. Potential issues include optimization instability, high sensitivity to hyperparameters, and scaling difficulties, as acknowledged in the limitations. Successful implementation requires substantial engineering effort and computational resources, posing considerable risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses critical challenges in RL: sample efficiency, exploration in sparse-reward environments, and learning meaningful representations. By leveraging neuro-inspired principles (predictive coding, active inference), it aligns perfectly with the goals of the NeuroAI field, aiming to bridge neuroscience and AI. Success could lead to major advancements in developing more efficient and capable RL agents with potential impacts in robotics, healthcare, and resource-constrained AI, while also providing a computational testbed for neuroscience theories."
