    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeuroAI theme by proposing a neuro-inspired approach (predictive coding, active inference) to tackle a key challenge (RL sample efficiency), which is highlighted in both the task description and the research idea. The objectives and methodology directly stem from the research idea. It acknowledges and aims to address challenges like sample efficiency and biologically plausible learning mentioned in the literature review, and the core concepts are related to the cited papers on active predictive coding."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology, and experimental plan are understandable. The structure is logical. However, some areas lack detail: the specific architecture of the 'Hierarchical Predictive Coding Network' is undefined, the implementation details of the 'Active Inference Module' (especially the calculation of expected free energy) are vague, and the provided mathematical formulation for free energy seems non-standard or incomplete for active inference, potentially causing confusion. Minor refinements in these areas would improve clarity significantly."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has some originality but shares significant similarities with existing work, particularly the cited papers by Rao et al. on active predictive coding which integrate similar concepts (PC, AI, RL, world models). The core idea of using PC/AI for efficient RL is becoming an active research area. The novelty appears to lie more in the specific implementation choices (e.g., integration with standard RL algorithms like Q-learning/policy gradients) and empirical validation on specific benchmarks, rather than a fundamentally new theoretical concept. The proposal could better articulate its unique contributions compared to closely related prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, based on established theories (PC, AI, RL). The overall approach of using PC for world modeling and AI for action selection is conceptually valid. However, the mathematical formulation provided for free energy (`F(x_t, a_t) = -log P(x_{t+1} | x_t, a_t) + D_{KL}(P(x_{t+1} | x_t, a_t) || P(x_{t+1}))`) is questionable and does not clearly represent the standard variational free energy or expected free energy used in active inference literature. This imprecision in the core mathematical concept weakens the technical rigor. While the experimental design is appropriate, the lack of detail on how the PC/AI components interact with the RL updates and the potentially flawed formulation lower the soundness score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Implementing hierarchical PC networks and integrating them with RL is complex but achievable. The main challenge lies in the active inference component, specifically the calculation of expected free energy, which is known to be computationally expensive and often requires sophisticated approximations, especially for complex environments or long planning horizons. The proposal does not detail how this computational challenge will be addressed. While the use of standard benchmarks simplifies data requirements, the technical hurdles in implementing and efficiently training the proposed model are non-trivial."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in RL: sample efficiency. Improving data efficiency would make RL applicable to a wider range of real-world problems where data is costly. The neuro-inspired approach aligns well with the goals of NeuroAI and could lead to more robust and generalizable learning systems. If successful, the work could provide valuable insights into both artificial and biological intelligence and offer a practical method for training RL agents more efficiently, especially in sparse-reward or complex exploration scenarios."
