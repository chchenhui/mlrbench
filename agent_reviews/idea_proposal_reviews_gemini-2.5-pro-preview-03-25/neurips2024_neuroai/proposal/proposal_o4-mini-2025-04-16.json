    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (NeuroAI focus on self-supervised systems like predictive coding/active inference, sample efficiency), the research idea (combining hierarchical predictive coding and active inference for RL), and the literature review (builds on PC/AI concepts, cites relevant work like Rao et al., addresses key challenges like sample efficiency). It translates the core idea into a concrete plan that fits the workshop's theme perfectly."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides detailed descriptions of the H-PCN architecture, the mathematical formulations for free energy and EFE, the PCAI-RL algorithm pseudocode, and a comprehensive experimental plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the proposed work."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing hierarchical predictive coding (H-PCN) with the active inference principle (specifically EFE minimization for action selection) within a reinforcement learning framework aimed at improving sample efficiency. While the constituent concepts exist, their specific integration (H-PCN + EFE + RL) and application focus represent a fresh approach compared to standard model-based RL (Dreamer, PlaNet) and related work like Active Predictive Coding (APC), which is appropriately listed as a baseline. The novelty lies in the specific architecture and the principled integration of EFE for exploration/exploitation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established theoretical frameworks (predictive coding, active inference, variational inference, RL). The proposed methodology, including the H-PCN structure, free energy minimization for model learning, and EFE minimization via MPC for action selection, is technically well-founded. Mathematical formulations appear correct. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant benchmarks, strong baselines, appropriate metrics, and necessary ablations. Potential challenges related to optimization stability and computational cost exist but do not undermine the fundamental soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating and optimizing the hierarchical predictive coding network (H-PCN) learning with the expected free energy (EFE) based action selection via model predictive control (MPC) is complex and computationally demanding. EFE estimation through rollouts, even with CEM sampling, can be very expensive. Success depends heavily on the effective training of the H-PCN and the stability of the joint optimization process. While achievable with significant expertise and computational resources (as acknowledged), it is not straightforward and carries implementation risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical challenge of sample inefficiency in reinforcement learning, a major barrier to real-world application. By leveraging principles from neuroscience (predictive coding, active inference), it promises not only to potentially achieve substantial improvements in data efficiency (2x-5x claimed) but also to strengthen the bridge between AI and neuroscience (NeuroAI). Success would provide strong evidence for the utility of these neuro-inspired mechanisms and could impact fields requiring efficient learning like robotics, autonomous systems, and healthcare."
