    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core research idea of using predictive coding (PC) and active inference (AIF) for data-efficient RL. It fits perfectly within the NeuroAI workshop's scope, particularly the themes of 'Self-supervised Systems in NeuroAI' (PC, AIF) and 'Neuro-inspired Computations' aiming for efficiency. The proposal effectively builds upon the cited literature (e.g., work by Rao et al. on APC/APCNs) and addresses key challenges identified in the review, such as sample efficiency and biologically plausible learning mechanisms. The methodology and objectives are directly derived from the idea and motivated by the task's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and logical. The overall framework (HPCN + AIPN) is well-described, and the core concepts of minimizing prediction error and expected free energy are explained. The experimental design is detailed and structured. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation of the expected free energy calculation (G(a)) and how the expectation over future states is handled. Additionally, the exact mechanism for combining the free energy and reward objectives in the backward pass could be slightly more explicit. However, the overall structure and main ideas are easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While predictive coding and active inference are established concepts, and their use in RL or world modeling has been explored (as shown in the literature review), the specific integration proposed here – using hierarchical PC for world modeling and AIF (via expected free energy minimization) explicitly for action selection within a deep RL framework as a dual objective alongside reward maximization – appears novel. It distinguishes itself from prior work focusing primarily on representation learning (APCNs, MPC) or planning (APC). The explicit formulation balancing expected free energy and Q-values for action selection in deep RL is a key innovative aspect."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical concepts from neuroscience (PC, AIF) and RL. The proposed methodology, combining a hierarchical world model with an AIF-driven policy, is conceptually coherent. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. However, the technical formulation for the total loss seems slightly simplified, and the practical implementation and stability of calculating expected free energy (G(a)) could pose challenges. The theoretical claim about the regret bound is interesting but presented as an expected outcome without derivation, requiring further rigorous proof. Overall, the approach is well-justified but involves non-trivial technical aspects."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current deep learning technology. Implementing hierarchical networks and integrating them with RL algorithms is standard practice. The main feasibility challenge lies in the efficient and stable computation or approximation of the expected free energy term (G(a)) for action selection, which might require significant engineering or algorithmic innovation. Balancing the different objectives (\\mathcal{F}, R) through hyperparameters (\\alpha, \\beta, \\eta) might also require extensive tuning. The proposed 100k steps training budget seems ambitious for achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks like Atari, even with improved sample efficiency. Access to standard GPU resources is assumed and sufficient."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical challenge of sample efficiency in RL, which is a major barrier to real-world deployment. Successfully integrating PC/AIF principles could lead to substantial improvements (expected 2-5x reduction in interactions). The research strongly aligns with the goals of NeuroAI, potentially advancing both AI capabilities (efficiency, interpretability) and computational neuroscience (providing testable models of brain function). The potential applications in low-resource settings (robotics, healthcare, neuromorphic hardware) further underscore its importance and potential impact."
