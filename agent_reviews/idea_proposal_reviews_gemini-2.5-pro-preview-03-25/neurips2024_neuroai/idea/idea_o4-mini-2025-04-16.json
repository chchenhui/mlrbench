        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics of the NeuroAI workshop: 1) 'Neuro-inspired Computations' through its use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), Hebbian-style plasticity, and neuromorphic hardware (Loihi); 2) 'Self-supervised Systems in NeuroAI' by explicitly proposing hierarchical predictive coding and active inference for self-supervised learning without labels, mirroring biological processes; and 3) potentially 'Neuro-inspired reasoning and decision-making' via the active inference module guiding camera actions. The motivation aligns with the workshop's goal of developing computationally less intensive systems inspired by biological intelligence."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (low-power, adaptive perception), the core components (hierarchical SNN, predictive coding, active inference, neuromorphic hardware, event-based camera), the learning mechanism (self-supervised, Hebbian updates), the evaluation plan (tasks, metrics), and the expected outcomes. The relationship between components (e.g., error signals driving active inference) is explained concisely. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like SNNs, predictive coding, active inference, and neuromorphic hardware exist in research, their specific integration into a hierarchical system on neuromorphic hardware, coupled with active inference driving a physical sensor (event-based camera) for self-supervised visual learning, represents a fresh and ambitious combination. It pushes beyond standard supervised learning paradigms for SNNs and explores a more biologically plausible, integrated perception-action loop on specialized hardware."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Neuromorphic platforms like Loihi are available but require specialized expertise. Implementing complex hierarchical predictive coding and active inference algorithms efficiently within the constraints of SNNs and neuromorphic hardware is non-trivial. Training such systems purely self-supervisedly to achieve robust performance on tasks like gesture recognition can be difficult. Integrating the software stack with the event-based camera and pan/tilt mechanism adds engineering complexity. However, all components exist, and research is progressing in these areas, making it ambitious but achievable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully implementing this system would represent a major step towards low-power, adaptive, and autonomous AI, particularly relevant for edge computing and robotics. It directly addresses the grand challenge of building AI that learns and adapts efficiently like biological brains. Furthermore, it provides a concrete platform for testing and refining theories of brain function (predictive coding, active inference) in a closed loop with physical interaction, potentially yielding valuable insights for both AI and neuroscience, aligning perfectly with the NeuroAI workshop's goals."
