    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Neuro-inspired Computations' topic listed in the workshop call, explicitly mentioning the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), Hebbian plasticity, and continual learning principles for adaptation without retraining â€“ all key elements highlighted in the task description's first topic. The motivation also aligns with the workshop's goal of exploring NeuroAI for computationally less intensive systems trained using small-data regimes and operating in dynamic scenarios."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main idea, methodology (using SNNs and Hebbian plasticity), expected outcomes (small-data learning, adaptation, performance maintenance), and potential impact (efficiency, robustness, edge AI, understanding biology) are articulated concisely and logically. There is very little ambiguity. Minor refinements could perhaps detail the specific type of SNN architecture or Hebbian rule envisioned, but the overall concept is immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines several existing concepts (SNNs, Hebbian plasticity, continual learning) which are known areas within NeuroAI. While the specific integration and focus on real-time adaptation using small datasets is relevant and valuable, the proposal doesn't explicitly outline a fundamentally new mechanism or theoretical breakthrough. It represents a solid, relevant research direction building on established neuro-inspired principles rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking concept. The novelty lies more in the specific implementation and application focus rather than foundational concepts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Training SNNs effectively, implementing stable and functional Hebbian plasticity for complex continual learning tasks (avoiding catastrophic forgetting while enabling adaptation), and achieving robust real-time performance are all non-trivial research problems. While tools, frameworks, and neuromorphic hardware (like Loihi, mentioned in the task) exist and are improving, successfully integrating these components into a system that meets all the stated goals (small data, real-time adaptation, long-term performance) requires considerable research effort and may face stability or scalability issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations of current AI, namely data inefficiency, computational cost, and the inability to learn continually and adapt in real-time environments (catastrophic forgetting). Success in this area could lead to major advancements in AI, particularly for applications requiring autonomy, efficiency, and operation in dynamic or resource-constrained settings (e.g., edge computing, robotics). Furthermore, it aligns with the broader goals of NeuroAI by potentially offering insights into biological learning mechanisms."
