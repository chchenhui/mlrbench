    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (WANT workshop focus on efficiency, scalability, re-materialization), the research idea (proactive gradient-aware checkpointing), and the literature review (builds upon/differentiates from DTR, addresses identified challenges). It directly tackles the core themes of the workshop and elaborates the specific idea within the context of existing work and its limitations."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives, motivation, methodology (including the gradient proxy, thresholding mechanism, and algorithm pseudocode), and experimental plan are articulated concisely and logically. The problem formulation is precise, and the rationale for the proposed approach is easy to understand. Minor implementation details are understandably omitted at the proposal stage."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. The core idea of using a lightweight gradient influence proxy (s_{\\ell,t}) to *proactively* decide which activations to checkpoint, combined with dynamic thresholding based on gradient statistics, is innovative compared to static methods or cost/memory-based dynamic methods like DTR. It's a fresh perspective on optimizing the checkpointing trade-off, clearly distinguished from prior work cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous. The problem is well-formulated, and the algorithmic steps are clearly defined. The use of EMA and quantile-based thresholding is reasonable. However, the core soundness relies on the heuristic proxy s_{\\ell,t} = \\\\|\\\\delta_\\\\ell \\\\odot a_\\\\ell\\\\|_2 effectively capturing the 'importance' of an activation for the final parameter update. While plausible and computationally cheap, this is an approximation whose effectiveness needs strong empirical validation, as local gradient magnitude doesn't perfectly equate to global update impact. The experimental plan is well-designed to test this."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core algorithmic additions (vector norm, EMA update) have low computational overhead. Integration into frameworks like PyTorch/DeepSpeed via checkpointing APIs or hooks is complex but demonstrated to be possible by prior work (e.g., DTR). The main challenges are careful implementation, especially in distributed settings, and securing the necessary computational resources for large-scale experiments, which are standard for this research area. The plan seems realistic with manageable technical risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical challenge of computational and memory efficiency in large-scale model training, a key bottleneck in modern AI. If the proposed method achieves the expected reductions in recomputation time, training throughput, and energy consumption without harming convergence, the impact would be substantial, potentially democratizing access to larger models and contributing to sustainable AI practices. The plan for integration into major frameworks further enhances potential impact."
