    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (WANT workshop themes like efficiency, scalability, resource optimization, activation checkpointing), the research idea (gradient-aware checkpointing), and the literature review (building upon DTR, Korthikanti et al., and addressing identified challenges). It directly tackles the core concept of optimizing activation checkpointing using gradient information, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope and addressing gaps highlighted by the cited papers."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (GAC framework steps, proxy estimation, dynamic thresholding), and experimental design are well-defined. The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for how backward pass decisions inform *future* forward passes and the exact interplay between the EMA and temporal adaptation formulas for the threshold. The pseudocode is quite high-level. However, the core concepts are understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While activation checkpointing and gradient analysis are known concepts, the specific idea of using a lightweight gradient proxy computed during the backward pass to *dynamically* and *proactively* adjust checkpointing decisions based on adaptive thresholds appears novel compared to static methods, memory-pressure-based dynamic methods (DTR), or structure-based selective methods (Korthikanti et al.). The novelty is clearly articulated against the backdrop of existing work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. The core idea of correlating gradient magnitude with recomputation importance is plausible. The methodology includes reasonable choices for gradient proxies (MAG, Frobenius norm) and a dynamic thresholding approach (EMA, adaptation based on validation loss). The experimental plan is comprehensive, with relevant baselines, metrics (including gradient accuracy checks), and diverse tasks. However, the technical formulation for distributed settings is high-level, and the interaction between the two threshold update mechanisms could be specified more rigorously. There's a minor inconsistency between the high savings claim (5x-10x) in Sec 1.3 and the more modest expected outcomes (20-40% recomputation time reduction) in Sec 3.1."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Implementing gradient hooks in PyTorch/TensorFlow is standard practice. The proposed gradient proxies (MAG) seem computationally lightweight, although the exact overhead needs empirical validation. The required resources (GPUs, standard datasets) are typical for ML research. Challenges include the potential complexity of tuning the dynamic threshold mechanism across different models/tasks and ensuring seamless integration with various distributed training strategies (tensor/pipeline parallelism), which might require significant engineering effort. The acknowledged ~3% overhead from proxy computation seems manageable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Optimizing memory and computation for large model training is a critical bottleneck in modern AI. Reducing redundant recomputations directly addresses computational efficiency and energy consumption (Green AI). Success would enable training larger models, accelerate research, and potentially democratize access to large-scale AI by lowering resource requirements. The potential impact spans multiple domains (NLP, CV, Science) and aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals."
