    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description (WANT workshop themes: computational efficiency, scalability, resource optimization, re-materialization), the research idea (gradient-aware checkpointing), and the literature review (builds upon existing work like DTR and Korthikanti et al., addresses identified challenges). It directly tackles activation checkpointing, a key topic mentioned in the task description, with the specific gradient-aware approach outlined in the idea. It also explicitly references the literature and positions itself relative to prior work while aiming to solve the highlighted challenges."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The core PGA-AC concept, including the practical implementation strategy (using gradient stats from iteration t to inform checkpointing in iteration t+1), gradient estimation techniques, thresholding, and experimental plan, are explained in detail with minimal ambiguity. The structure is easy to follow. Minor potential confusion around the initial conceptual description versus the practical implementation is quickly resolved."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. The core idea of incorporating real-time (or near real-time, iteration-to-iteration) gradient magnitude information into the activation checkpointing decision process appears novel. While prior work optimized checkpointing based on graph structure (Chen et al.), memory dynamics (Kirisame et al.), or heuristics (Korthikanti et al.), this proposal introduces gradient awareness as a primary driver for dynamically optimizing the re-computation trade-off. This represents a significant conceptual shift from existing methods discussed in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on the reasonable premise that recomputing activations with negligible gradients is wasteful. The proposed methodology (gradient estimation proxies, dynamic thresholding, integration via hooks/wrappers) is technically plausible. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, large-scale models, distributed settings, ablation studies, and appropriate metrics covering both efficiency and model quality. Potential technical challenges (estimation overhead, distributed integration) are acknowledged. The technical formulations for estimation methods are clear."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Implementing the gradient estimation proxies and integrating the dynamic logic into complex checkpointing mechanisms within distributed frameworks like PyTorch FSDP requires significant engineering effort and expertise. Access to substantial GPU resources (8-64 A100/H100) is necessary for the proposed experiments, which might be a constraint. The success hinges on the gradient estimation being sufficiently lightweight, which needs empirical validation. However, the overall plan is realistic, and the proposed methods (hooks, wrappers) are standard techniques for framework customization."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck (computational overhead of checkpointing) in training large-scale models, a central theme of the WANT workshop. Success would lead to tangible benefits: faster training, reduced energy consumption, improved resource utilization, and potentially wider accessibility of large model training. By introducing gradient-awareness to checkpointing, it could open new research directions in training optimization. The potential impact on accelerating AI research and development is substantial."
