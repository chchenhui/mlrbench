        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (Temporal Graph Learning Workshop). It directly addresses key workshop topics, including 'Temporal Graph Modelling & Representation Learning' (through temporal embeddings and attention) and 'Temporal Graph Applications' (specifically 'Anomaly Detection' and 'Explainability'). The focus on temporal dynamics, anomaly prediction, and interpretability fits perfectly within the workshop's scope of bridging areas like temporal knowledge graph learning, graph anomaly detection, and representation learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly defines the motivation (lack of interpretability in early anomaly detection), the core proposal (interpretable temporal graph attention), the mechanism (constrained attention highlighting precursor patterns), and the expected outcomes (improved early detection and actionable explanations). Minor ambiguity exists regarding the specific nature of the constraints ('e.g., via regularization or structural design'), which could be further specified, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While temporal graph networks, attention mechanisms, and interpretability methods exist individually, the specific combination aimed at *early* anomaly prediction by constraining attention to identify minimal *precursor* subgraphs and temporal patterns offers a fresh perspective. The novelty lies less in inventing entirely new components and more in the targeted design and application focus on interpretable *early* warnings, differentiating it from standard anomaly detection or post-hoc explanation methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It proposes building upon existing temporal graph network architectures and attention mechanisms, which are well-established. Implementing constraints on attention weights (regularization or structural) is technically achievable, although designing effective constraints that genuinely highlight meaningful precursors might require significant experimentation and tuning. Standard benchmark datasets for temporal graph anomaly detection are available for evaluation. The main challenge lies in rigorously evaluating the quality and actionability of the generated explanations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Early and interpretable anomaly detection is a critical need in domains like finance, cybersecurity, and system monitoring. Providing not just an early warning but also a rationale based on precursor events could significantly enhance trust, enable timely intervention, and improve the practical utility of temporal graph models in real-world, high-stakes scenarios. Success would be a meaningful contribution to both anomaly detection and explainable AI."
