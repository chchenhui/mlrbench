    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on Temporal Graph Learning, specifically mentioning 'Hyperbolic Temporal Graphs', 'Temporal Graph Forecasting', and 'Anomaly Detection'. The proposal's core idea (HyTECL) perfectly matches the research idea provided, aiming to combine hyperbolic GNNs with temporal contrastive learning. It explicitly builds upon and differentiates itself from works mentioned in the literature review (HGWaveNet, HTGN, HGCL) and tackles the identified challenge of integrating hyperbolic geometry with temporal dynamics and contrastive learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the model architecture (Hyperbolic GCN, Temporal Contrastive Learning, Memory Module) with clear mathematical formulations for key operations like feature projection, aggregation, contrastive loss, and the hyperbolic GRU. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, and metrics, is specific and easy to understand. The structure is logical and facilitates comprehension."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While hyperbolic GNNs (HGNN, Chami et al.), temporal GNNs (TGN survey), contrastive learning for graphs (You et al.), hyperbolic-temporal models (HGWaveNet, HTGN), and hyperbolic contrastive learning for static graphs (HGCL) exist, HyTECL proposes a novel *combination* and *adaptation*. Specifically, it integrates hyperbolic geometry with *temporal* contrastive learning tailored for dynamic graphs, including time-aware augmentations and a hyperbolic contrastive loss, alongside a hyperbolic memory module. This synthesis addresses a specific gap highlighted in the literature review and represents a fresh approach compared to existing individual components or partial integrations."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical foundations in hyperbolic geometry, graph neural networks, contrastive learning, and recurrent networks (GRUs). The proposed methodology adapts these concepts logically to the hyperbolic-temporal setting. The mathematical formulations for hyperbolic operations (exp/log maps, distance) and the contrastive loss appear correct and standard adaptations. The hyperbolic GRU formulation is complex but follows a plausible structure analogous to its Euclidean counterpart. The use of specific datasets and standard evaluation metrics strengthens the experimental design. Minor areas for further justification could include the choice of Fermi-Dirac attention over other hyperbolic attention mechanisms, but overall the approach is well-grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on publicly available datasets commonly used in temporal graph research. The required computational resources (GPUs) and software frameworks are standard for deep learning, although implementing hyperbolic operations requires specific libraries or careful custom implementation, which is achievable as shown by prior work. The complexity of integrating hyperbolic layers, temporal contrastive learning, and a memory module is significant but manageable within a research context. The experimental plan is realistic. Potential risks involve optimization difficulties in hyperbolic space, but these are known challenges in the field rather than fundamental impossibilities."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the important challenge of modeling dynamic graphs that exhibit both temporal evolution and latent hierarchical structures, a common scenario in real-world networks (finance, social, biology) but poorly handled by existing methods. By unifying hyperbolic geometry with temporal contrastive learning, HyTECL could lead to substantial improvements in tasks like dynamic link prediction and anomaly/fraud detection where hierarchy matters over time. Success would represent a meaningful advancement in temporal graph representation learning and provide a valuable tool for analyzing complex evolving systems."
