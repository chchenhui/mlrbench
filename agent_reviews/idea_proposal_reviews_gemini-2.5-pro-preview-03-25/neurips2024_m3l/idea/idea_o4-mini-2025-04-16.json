        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice', including understanding 'Convergence analysis beyond the stable regime', the 'Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon', and the use of 'Continuous approximations of training trajectories' like SDEs. The idea directly tackles EoS using a curvature-aware SDE framework, aiming to provide theoretical insights and practical guidance, which fits squarely within the workshop's primary focus areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation explicitly states the problem (EoS in deep learning). The main idea clearly outlines the proposed methodology: modeling optimizers as SDEs incorporating curvature and noise, using Fokker-Planck analysis to characterize EoS, validating the approach, and extending it to adaptive methods. The concepts are specific and the research plan is logical and understandable, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using SDEs to model optimization and studying EoS are existing research directions, the specific proposal to incorporate a 'Hessian-weighted correction' (curvature-awareness) directly into the SDE drift term and link it via Fokker-Planck analysis to quantify the EoS threshold appears innovative. This combination of curvature, stochasticity, and Fokker-Planck analysis specifically for EoS offers a fresh perspective compared to prior work often focusing on deterministic dynamics or simpler noise models. The extension to adaptive optimizers via SDE preconditioning also adds to the novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Deriving and analyzing the proposed SDE and associated Fokker-Planck equation requires advanced mathematical techniques. While validation on toy models is straightforward, applying it accurately to mid-sized Transformers and extending it rigorously to adaptive optimizers like Adam will require careful approximations and substantial computational effort. The analytical tractability of the Fokker-Planck equation for realistic deep learning scenarios might be limited, potentially requiring numerical methods or simplifying assumptions. It's feasible for experts but not trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding and predicting the Edge of Stability is a critical open problem in deep learning optimization, particularly relevant for training large models efficiently. A successful theoretical framework, as proposed, could lead to principled methods for selecting learning rates and designing schedules, potentially replacing costly trial-and-error and saving substantial computational resources. Providing predictive, curvature-aware guidelines would be a major contribution to both the theory and practice of deep learning."
