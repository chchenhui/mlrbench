        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice', specifically mentioning 'Convergence analysis beyond the stable regime' and 'How should we understand the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon?'. The proposed research directly tackles the EoS phenomenon using a theoretical framework (phase transitions) to bridge the gap between theory and practice in large model training, which is a central theme of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (EoS paradox, cost of large model training). The main idea is well-defined: proposing a phase transition framework using statistical physics concepts (renormalization group theory) to understand and leverage EoS, aiming for specific outcomes like adaptive learning rates and computational cost reduction. While the exact technical implementation details of applying renormalization group theory are complex and not fully elaborated, the core concept and research direction are crystal clear and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While applying statistical physics concepts to machine learning isn't entirely new, framing the Edge of Stability specifically as a beneficial phase transition and proposing the use of renormalization group theory to model and control this phenomenon offers a fresh perspective. Developing tools to identify phase boundaries and derive adaptive learning rate schedules based on this framework represents a significant departure from standard optimization analysis and empirical EoS studies. It proposes a novel theoretical lens and practical application for a known challenging phenomenon."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is satisfactory but presents significant challenges. Applying advanced statistical physics concepts like renormalization group theory rigorously to the high-dimensional, non-convex, and complex dynamics of deep learning optimization is theoretically demanding. Translating this framework into practical tools for identifying phase boundaries and creating robust adaptive learning rate schedules that work across diverse architectures and datasets is a major hurdle. While conceptually intriguing, the path from theory to practical implementation and achieving the claimed 30-50% cost reduction with theoretical guarantees is ambitious and faces considerable technical difficulties."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds excellent significance. Understanding and potentially controlling the Edge of Stability is crucial for efficient and reliable training of large-scale models, which is a major bottleneck in modern AI. A successful theoretical framework that explains EoS and leads to practical optimization strategies (like adaptive learning rates reducing compute cost significantly) would represent a major advancement in both deep learning theory and practice. Providing theoretical guarantees in this regime would be a substantial breakthrough. The potential impact on the field is very high."
