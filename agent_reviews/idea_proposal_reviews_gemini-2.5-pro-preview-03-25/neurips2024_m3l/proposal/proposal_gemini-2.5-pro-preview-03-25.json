        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with all provided materials. It directly addresses the task description's focus on reconciling theory and practice in deep learning, specifically targeting the 'Effect of Data' (number of passes) in foundation model pretraining. It perfectly elaborates on the research idea, expanding its core concepts into detailed objectives and methodology. Furthermore, it explicitly incorporates and builds upon the literature review, referencing the cited works (including the fictional ones provided for context) and positioning itself to address the identified key challenges like overfitting, lack of theory, and balancing efficiency/performance. The proposal's objectives and significance directly map onto the workshop's themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated precisely and logically. The mathematical setup is introduced clearly, and the distinction between different experimental settings (fixed vs. variable compute) is well-explained. The structure is easy to follow, guiding the reader from the problem statement to the proposed solution and its potential impact. While the theoretical aspects are inherently complex, the proposal outlines the intended approach and analytical targets without significant ambiguity. Only minor refinements might be possible, but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the issue of data repetition and its empirical effects are known (as indicated in the literature review), this proposal aims for a *comprehensive theoretical framework* specifically for LLM pretraining that simultaneously analyzes optimization dynamics, generalization, *and* representation quality as a function of the number of epochs (E). This synthesis, depth, and focus on deriving *principled, theory-backed guidelines* distinguishes it from prior empirical studies, fragmented theoretical insights, or work focused on different stages like instruction tuning or continued pretraining. The integration of perspectives from optimization, generalization theory, and information geometry for this specific problem constitutes a novel approach."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It grounds its theoretical approach in well-established fields like stochastic optimization, statistical learning theory, and information geometry, referencing relevant concepts (AdamW convergence, EoS, generalization measures, CKA). The proposed methodology for both theoretical analysis (modeling gradient statistics, adapting convergence bounds, analyzing generalization gap, evaluating representations) and empirical validation (controlled experiments, standard architectures/datasets, relevant metrics, baselines, statistical analysis) is robust and follows best practices. The proposal acknowledges the inherent difficulties in deep learning theory but outlines a coherent and logical research plan. Technical formulations are presented correctly at the proposal level."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant practical challenges, primarily related to computational cost. Training multiple LLMs across various scales (model size, dataset size) and epoch counts, especially under different compute budget constraints, requires massive computational resources that may not be readily available. While mitigation strategies (moderate scales, efficient libraries) are mentioned, the empirical validation plan remains extremely demanding. Additionally, deriving non-vacuous theoretical bounds for complex LLM dynamics is notoriously difficult. The project is ambitious; successful execution depends heavily on securing substantial compute resources and navigating complex theoretical hurdles. Therefore, while conceptually sound, its practical implementation presents considerable risks and challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in modern machine learning. Optimizing the pretraining process for LLMs, particularly data usage strategies like epoch selection, has enormous implications due to the immense costs involved. Successfully developing a theoretical framework and practical guidelines for choosing the number of epochs (E) would offer substantial scientific contributions (advancing understanding of large-scale training dynamics, generalization, representation learning) and practical impact (significant savings in compute, energy, time; potentially better models; more sustainable AI development). It directly tackles core issues relevant to the workshop and the broader AI community."
