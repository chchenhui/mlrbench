        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of evaluating mathematical reasoning in LLMs, specifically the challenge of designing robust benchmarks. The proposal fully elaborates on the core research idea (adaptive PCG for assessment) and effectively integrates concepts and addresses challenges identified in the literature review, such as data contamination (Mathador-LM, Brown & Green), adaptive generation (TATA, Doe & Smith, Chen & Lee, White & Black), and reasoning process evaluation (ReasonEval). It clearly positions itself within the recent advancements discussed in the provided literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, with understandable objectives and a logical flow. The core concepts of PCG, adaptivity, and reasoning assessment are introduced. However, certain aspects of the methodology could be more explicit. For instance, the specifics of template/constraint design for PCG, the precise mechanism for difficulty adjustment (Delta D), and the exact integration details of the reasoning quality assessment (like ReasonEval) are somewhat high-level. The mathematical formulas provided are illustrative rather than rigorously defined. While generally well-articulated, these minor ambiguities slightly detract from perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several existing concepts (PCG, adaptive testing, reasoning process evaluation) into a unified system specifically for *evaluating* LLM mathematical reasoning. While the literature review shows prior work on dynamic benchmarks (Mathador-LM), adaptive learning/generation (TATA, Doe & Smith, etc.), and reasoning evaluation (ReasonEval), the proposed integration of these elements—particularly the adaptive difficulty adjustment based on LLM performance combined with reasoning quality assessment for robust, contamination-resistant evaluation—offers a fresh perspective distinct from prior work focusing on static benchmarks, adaptive training, or non-adaptive dynamic generation. The novelty lies in this specific combination and application focus."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, built upon recognized challenges (data contamination) and established techniques (PCG, adaptive methods). The overall research design is logical. However, it lacks technical depth and rigor in the methodology. Key operational details are missing: how problem difficulty will be reliably quantified and adjusted, how diverse reasoning skills will be systematically covered by templates/constraints, and how the reasoning quality assessment (e.g., integrating ReasonEval) will be automated robustly for generated problems. The mathematical formulas are superficial. The experimental design is standard but lacks specifics. These gaps weaken the perceived rigor of the proposed methodology."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing a comprehensive PCG system for diverse mathematical reasoning is complex. Accurately modeling problem difficulty and implementing a robust adaptive mechanism based on LLM performance is non-trivial. The most challenging aspect appears to be the automated assessment of reasoning quality for diverse, procedurally generated problems, which requires sophisticated parsing and evaluation capabilities beyond simple answer checking. While components exist in isolation (as per the literature), integrating them into a seamless, effective system requires substantial engineering effort and potentially novel algorithmic solutions. Resource requirements (compute for generation and LLM evaluation) could also be considerable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in AI: the robust evaluation of LLM reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. Overcoming issues like data contamination and moving beyond simple accuracy metrics on static benchmarks is critical for genuine progress in the field. If successful, the proposed system could provide invaluable tools for more accurate assessment, offer diagnostic insights into model strengths/weaknesses, and potentially guide the development of more capable AI systems. This aligns perfectly with the goals of the workshop and addresses a fundamental challenge in contemporary AI research."
