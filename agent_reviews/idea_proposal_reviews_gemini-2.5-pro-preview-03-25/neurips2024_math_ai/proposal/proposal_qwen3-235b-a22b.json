    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of understanding LLM mathematical comprehension and the need for better evaluation methods beyond static benchmarks (a key topic mentioned). It perfectly embodies the research idea by focusing on PCG, adaptive difficulty, and diagnostic assessment. Furthermore, it explicitly incorporates and builds upon the key papers identified in the literature review (Mathador-LM, ReasonEval, TATA), positioning itself effectively within the current research landscape and addressing the highlighted challenges like data contamination and reasoning process evaluation."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and logically connected. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the PCG framework, the adaptive mechanism (including a specific formula), and the experimental design. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to methods, evaluation, and expected impact. The language is precise, and technical concepts are explained or referenced appropriately, leaving minimal room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several existing concepts into a novel framework. While PCG for math problems, adaptive systems, and step-based evaluation exist individually (as shown in the literature review), the proposal's novelty lies in their specific integration for the purpose of creating a *dynamic, adaptive, diagnostic assessment tool for LLM mathematical reasoning*. It goes beyond dynamic generation (Mathador-LM) by adding adaptive difficulty based on multi-faceted performance (accuracy + step consistency) and aims for skill-specific profiling, which represents a significant advancement over static benchmarks and simpler dynamic ones."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is methodologically sound and rigorous. It builds upon established techniques like template-based PCG and principles from adaptive testing. The proposed evaluation plan is comprehensive, including comparisons with SOTA models and benchmarks, relevant metrics (accuracy, step validity, generalization, adaptability), ablation studies, and crucial human validation. The use of semantic hashing for contamination checks and referencing specific methods like ReasonEval adds to the rigor. While the proposed difficulty adaptation formula is heuristic, its simplicity is reasonable for a starting point, and the proposal acknowledges alternatives (RL) for exploration."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. The core technologies (PCG, LLM APIs, evaluation metrics) are available. However, curating a high-quality library of 1,000+ diverse problem templates requires significant domain expertise and effort. Ensuring the generated problems are consistently well-posed and evaluating step-validity robustly across diverse generated solutions automatically can be complex. The adaptive mechanism will likely require careful tuning. While ambitious, the plan is realistic if adequate resources and expertise are available."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in AI research: the robust and insightful evaluation of LLM reasoning capabilities, particularly addressing data contamination and the limitations of accuracy-only metrics. Success would provide a much-needed tool for the community, enabling deeper understanding of LLM strengths/weaknesses and guiding future development. The potential impact extends to improving benchmark integrity, fostering more reliable model comparisons, and informing educational applications (adaptive tutoring), directly aligning with the workshop's goals and broader AI research priorities."
