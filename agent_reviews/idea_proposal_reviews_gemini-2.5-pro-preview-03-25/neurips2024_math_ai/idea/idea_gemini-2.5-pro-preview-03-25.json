        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses one of the key topics listed in the workshop description: 'Measuring mathematical reasoning: How do we design benchmarks which accurately evaluate mathematical reasoning abilities, especially in an era of large language models?'. It tackles the issue of static benchmark contamination and proposes a dynamic, adaptive approach, which is highly relevant to understanding the extent to which ML models comprehend mathematics, aligning perfectly with the workshop's guiding theme and specific topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly. The motivation (limitations of static benchmarks), the core proposal (adaptive PCG for math problems), and the expected outcomes (robust evaluation, diagnostic profiles) are well-articulated and easy to understand. The concepts of PCG and adaptive assessment in this context are clearly explained. While specific implementation details are omitted, the overall research direction and methodology are unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While procedural generation and adaptive testing exist independently, their combination specifically for generating adaptive mathematical reasoning benchmarks for LLMs is innovative. It moves beyond static datasets towards dynamic evaluation environments. Using PCG to control for specific reasoning skills and adapt difficulty/style based on model performance represents a fresh approach compared to standard benchmark creation and evaluation practices."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant engineering and research challenges. Generating structured mathematical problems programmatically is possible using templates, constraints, and symbolic math tools. Implementing an adaptive loop based on LLM output is also achievable. However, ensuring the generated problems are consistently well-posed, accurately target specific reasoning skills, and have controllable difficulty levels requires careful design, extensive validation, and potentially significant effort. Integrating these components into a robust system is non-trivial but achievable with current technology and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Benchmark contamination and the limitations of static evaluation are critical issues hindering reliable assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities. This proposal offers a potential solution for creating more robust, dynamic, and insightful evaluations. Developing methods that provide detailed diagnostic profiles instead of just single scores would be a major advancement for understanding and improving AI mathematical reasoning. It addresses a pressing need in the field with high potential impact."
