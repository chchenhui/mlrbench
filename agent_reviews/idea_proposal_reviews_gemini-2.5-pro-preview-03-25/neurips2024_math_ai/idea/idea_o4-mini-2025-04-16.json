        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on 'Measuring mathematical reasoning' especially for LLMs, and 'Humans vs. machines' comparisons in mathematical reasoning. CogMatTest directly addresses these core topics by proposing a novel benchmark designed for fine-grained, comparative evaluation of cognitive skills in both AI and humans. It also aligns with the overall theme of understanding the extent to which machines can 'comprehend mathematics'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (limitations of current benchmarks), the main components (skill taxonomy/item bank, adaptive engine, comparative evaluation), and the expected outcomes (interpretable profiles, model improvement insights, collaboration guidelines) are articulated concisely and logically. The use of specific concepts like IRT indicates a clear direction, leaving little room for ambiguity about the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While benchmarks for mathematical reasoning exist, CogMatTest's novelty lies in its specific focus on a fine-grained *cognitive skill taxonomy* derived from cognitive science, the use of *Item Response Theory (IRT)* for calibration, and an *adaptive testing* mechanism applied to LLMs. This combination moves beyond standard accuracy metrics towards a more diagnostic and interpretable evaluation framework, offering fresh perspectives compared to existing static benchmarks like MATH or GSM8K."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant implementation effort. Developing a robust and validated cognitive skill taxonomy for mathematics is a complex task requiring deep expertise. Creating and calibrating (via IRT) a large item bank, potentially using procedural generation, is resource-intensive. The adaptive testing engine and LLM evaluation components are technically achievable with existing methods and APIs. Human subject testing adds logistical overhead. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable with dedicated resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical gap in current LLM evaluation methodologies for mathematical reasoning â€“ the lack of interpretable, fine-grained skill assessment. Success would provide deeper insights into how LLMs reason mathematically, pinpointing specific strengths and weaknesses. This could directly inform targeted improvements in model architecture and training, facilitate more meaningful human-AI comparisons, and potentially guide the development of AI tools for education and scientific discovery, aligning strongly with the workshop's goals."
