    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the task (treating weights as a modality, exploring symmetries, using GNNs, model retrieval applications). It faithfully implements the research idea (permutation-equivariant GNN encoder, contrastive learning for retrieval). It acknowledges and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself within the current research landscape and addressing key challenges identified (symmetries, scalability, contrastive learning, evaluation)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured with understandable objectives, significance, and expected outcomes. The overall methodology (GNN + contrastive learning) is outlined. However, crucial technical details are lacking: the specific graph representation of weights, the exact GNN architecture and implementation of equivariance, the precise definition of 'functionally distinct' models for negative sampling, and the similarity function used in the loss. These omissions create minor ambiguities regarding the exact implementation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. It combines several recent and relevant techniques (equivariant GNNs, contrastive learning) for the specific task of model zoo retrieval based on weights. While the individual components and even similar goals appear in the recent literature review (e.g., Lit Review #1, #6, #7, #10), the specific focus on permutation *equivariance* (rather than just invariance) within a contrastive framework for retrieval offers some distinction. However, it doesn't present a groundbreaking concept and its differentiation from very recent, closely related works (like #7 and #10) is not strongly articulated."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. The theoretical basis (leveraging symmetries, using GNNs for graph-structured data, contrastive learning for representation) is solid. The overall methodology is appropriate for the problem. The experimental design includes relevant comparisons and metrics. However, the lack of specific technical details on the GNN architecture, equivariance implementation, graph construction, and negative sampling strategy prevents a full assessment of rigor and introduces potential weaknesses if not carefully addressed. The provided mathematical formulation is standard but incomplete (missing similarity function definition)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Accessing model zoo data (e.g., from Hugging Face) is practical. The required technologies (GNNs, contrastive learning frameworks) are mature. Implementing equivariant layers is achievable. The main challenge lies in the computational scale required to process large numbers of potentially large models and train the GNN, demanding significant computational resources (GPU time, memory). Defining functional similarity robustly might also pose practical difficulties. Overall, the plan is realistic assuming adequate resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and growing problem in machine learning: navigating massive model zoos efficiently. Solving this would save considerable computational resources and researcher time currently spent on redundant training or suboptimal model selection. It directly contributes to the emerging field of 'weights as a data modality' and has clear potential to enhance transfer learning practices and democratize access to pre-trained models, aligning perfectly with the task description's goals."
