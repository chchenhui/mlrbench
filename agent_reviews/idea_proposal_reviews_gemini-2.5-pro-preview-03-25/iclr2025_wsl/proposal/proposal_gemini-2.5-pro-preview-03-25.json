    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of navigating large model zoos highlighted in the task description and motivation. It elaborates comprehensively on the research idea of using permutation-equivariant contrastive embeddings. Furthermore, it explicitly incorporates and builds upon concepts mentioned in the literature review, such as the importance of symmetries (Erdogan, 2025; Hypothetical Papers 7, 9), the use of GNNs for weight analysis (Hypothetical Paper 8; Pei et al., 2020), and contrastive learning for weight representations (Hypothetical Papers 6, 10). The objectives and methodology directly tackle the key questions and challenges outlined in the task description and literature review (e.g., leveraging symmetries, efficient representation, scalability, evaluation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, starting with a strong background and motivation, followed by clearly articulated research objectives. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of data collection, the proposed PEACE architecture (layer-level GNN, network-level aggregation), the contrastive learning framework (positive/negative pair generation), and a comprehensive experimental validation plan. The rationale behind each component is well-explained. While the exact GNN architecture details for achieving simultaneous permutation and scaling equivariance/invariance require implementation-level specification, the overall approach and concepts are presented with high clarity and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like GNNs for graph data, contrastive learning, and equivariant architectures exist, their specific synthesis and application to neural network weights for model retrieval in this manner is novel. The core novelty lies in the proposed PEACE framework: the hierarchical design using permutation-equivariant GNNs at the layer level, the specific formulation of symmetry-aware contrastive learning (defining positive pairs via permutation/scaling augmentations), and the use of a Transformer for network-level aggregation of layer embeddings. It effectively integrates recent ideas (cited from literature, including hypothetical papers) into a concrete, end-to-end system for a specific, challenging problem. It clearly distinguishes itself from naive weight comparisons or purely metadata-based search."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical concepts from equivariant deep learning (GNNs), representation learning (contrastive methods), and sequence modeling (Transformers). The rationale for choosing these components is well-justified (GNNs for structure/symmetry, contrastive learning for similarity, Transformers for inter-layer dependencies). The methodology, particularly the contrastive learning setup with symmetry-preserving augmentations and strategic negative sampling, is well-reasoned. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse evaluation tasks (retrieval, transfer learning), ablation studies, and scalability analysis. Potential challenges like achieving perfect symmetry invariance are acknowledged, but the proposed direction is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some significant challenges. Accessing model zoos and extracting weights is straightforward. Implementing GNNs, Transformers, and contrastive learning is standard practice. However, developing and training the permutation-equivariant GNN module, especially ensuring robustness to both permutation and scaling symmetries across diverse layer types, requires considerable expertise and careful engineering. Training the PEACE encoder will likely demand substantial computational resources (GPU time, memory) due to the complexity of GNNs and contrastive learning on potentially large weight tensors. Curating ground truth for functional similarity requires careful design. While achievable for a well-resourced research group, the computational cost and engineering complexity lower the feasibility score slightly from excellent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in machine learning: the difficulty of navigating and reusing the vast number of available pre-trained models. Successfully developing the PEACE framework would provide a powerful tool for efficient model discovery, potentially saving significant computational resources and human effort currently wasted on redundant training or suboptimal model selection. This directly contributes to sustainable AI practices. Furthermore, it advances the fundamental understanding of neural network weight spaces as a data modality, particularly the role of symmetries, aligning perfectly with the workshop's core theme. The potential impact spans accelerating research via better transfer learning, enabling new analysis methods, and democratizing the use of large model repositories."
