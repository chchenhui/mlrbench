    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the workshop (NN weights as a data modality), focuses on key properties (symmetries), leverages relevant learning paradigms (contrastive learning, GNNs), targets a crucial application (model retrieval), and acknowledges the challenges identified in the literature (scalability, symmetry handling, evaluation). The objectives and methodology directly stem from the research idea and are well-supported by the cited works and the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology, and evaluation plan are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The use of equations for the GNN and contrastive loss aids clarity. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise implementation details of the learnable MLPs within the GNN or the exact mechanism for ensuring scaling equivariance within the GNN architecture itself (beyond using it as an augmentation), but these do not significantly hinder the overall comprehension of the proposed work."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several recent concepts in a specific way. While GNNs for weights, contrastive learning, and symmetry considerations exist (as shown in the literature review), the proposal focuses on *permutation-equivariance* (a stronger condition than invariance often discussed) within a GNN framework, combined explicitly with *scaling* augmentations for contrastive learning, all tailored for large-scale model retrieval. This specific combination and the focus on building a unified, scalable framework represent a novel contribution beyond simply applying existing techniques individually. It's an innovative synthesis rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations regarding neural network symmetries and established techniques like GNNs and contrastive learning (NT-Xent). The methodology is generally well-justified, linking symmetries to augmentations and using appropriate learning objectives. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and includes necessary baselines and ablations. A minor weakness is the lack of explicit detail on how the GNN architecture itself enforces scaling equivariance, as the equations primarily demonstrate permutation equivariance. However, the overall approach is technically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant computational and implementation challenges. Acquiring and processing 50k-100k models is feasible but resource-intensive. Training the proposed equivariant GNN with contrastive learning on this scale requires substantial GPU resources (memory and compute time). Implementing permutation-equivariant GNNs correctly requires specific expertise. While ambitious, the plan is detailed enough to be considered realistic for a well-equipped research group, though potential bottlenecks in scalability and resource availability exist."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: efficiently navigating and utilizing the rapidly growing number of pre-trained models. Success would lead to substantial impact by reducing redundant computation and energy consumption, accelerating ML research and deployment (especially in resource-constrained settings), and democratizing access to powerful models. The work could establish a new standard for model retrieval and comparison, and the planned benchmark dataset would be a valuable community resource. It directly contributes to the core goals outlined in the task description."
