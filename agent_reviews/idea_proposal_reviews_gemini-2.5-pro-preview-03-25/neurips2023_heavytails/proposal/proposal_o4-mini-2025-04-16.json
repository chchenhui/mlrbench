        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's goal of repositioning heavy tails from a 'phenomenon' to an understood and potentially beneficial aspect of ML training. The research idea of HTGA is clearly reflected in the proposal's objectives and methodology. The proposal builds upon and cites relevant recent literature (Raj et al., 2023; Hübler et al., 2024; Dupuis & Viallard, 2023), positioning itself within the current research landscape identified in the review. It tackles key challenges mentioned, such as the interplay between heavy tails, stability, and generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The HTGA framework is broken down into understandable components (estimator, controller, update rule) with specific mathematical formulations provided for key parts. The experimental design is detailed and unambiguous. The overall structure is easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the existence and analysis of heavy tails in SGD are known (as per the literature review), the core idea of *adaptively amplifying* gradients to maintain a target tail index (`alpha*`) is novel. Most existing methods focus on analyzing the effects of heavy tails (Raj et al., Dupuis et al.) or mitigating them (Hübler et al., Lee et al.'s TailOPT clipping). HTGA proposes actively *engineering* the tail behavior as a control mechanism for exploration/exploitation, which represents a fresh perspective distinct from prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on relevant theoretical foundations (heavy-tail phenomena, Hill estimators, Lévy processes). The motivation is well-grounded in recent literature. However, some aspects require further justification or carry potential weaknesses. The choice of coordinate-wise Hill estimation and its robustness could be discussed more. The specific form of the rank-based weighting `w_i` and its theoretical justification for achieving the desired tail amplification need stronger support. The planned theoretical analysis using Lévy SDEs is appropriate but ambitious, and connecting the discrete algorithm dynamics precisely to the continuous SDE model requires careful treatment and potentially strong assumptions. While the overall approach is plausible, the soundness of the specific update rule mechanism and the tractability of the full theoretical analysis have some open questions."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The experimental part of the proposal is largely feasible. The proposed algorithm components (tail estimation, controller, update rule) appear implementable within standard frameworks like PyTorch, although the rank-based weighting adds computational overhead compared to standard SGD/Adam. The experimental plan uses standard datasets and evaluation protocols. The main feasibility challenge lies in the theoretical analysis, which involves complex stochastic processes (Lévy SDEs) applied to an adaptive algorithm; achieving rigorous convergence and generalization bounds might be difficult and time-consuming. There's also a risk that the empirical benefits might be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning (e.g., `alpha*`, `eta_gamma`, `beta`, `k`). Overall, the empirical validation is feasible, but the theoretical goals are challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and timely topic in deep learning optimization – the role of heavy-tailed gradients. By proposing to actively leverage heavy tails for better generalization, it challenges conventional wisdom and could open up new avenues for optimizer design. If successful, HTGA could provide a practical tool for improving model robustness and performance, particularly in challenging scenarios like low-data or noisy labels. The work aims to bridge theory (heavy-tailed dynamics) and practice (optimizer design), potentially leading to substantial advancements in understanding and controlling deep learning training dynamics. The potential impact on both the theoretical and applied ML communities is high."
