    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call to reposition heavy tails from a 'phenomenon' to an 'expected behavior' that can be leveraged, focusing on key topics like stochastic optimization and generalization. It elaborates the core HTGA concept from the research idea and clearly situates itself within the provided literature, explicitly contrasting its goal (leveraging tails) with the mitigation/stability focus of many cited works (e.g., HÃ¼bler et al., Armacki et al.). The problem statement effectively identifies a gap based on the current state of the art described."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific, the HTGA mechanism is mathematically defined, and the experimental plan is detailed and logical. The overall structure is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of the *online* tail index estimator (though options are mentioned) and the exact update mechanism or selection strategy for the scaling factor \\\\tau_t. However, these do not significantly hinder the understanding of the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. The core idea of adaptively modulating gradient norms based on an online estimate of the gradient distribution's tail index (\\\\\\\\hat{\\\\\\\\alpha}_t) specifically to *leverage* or *amplify* heavy-tailed behavior for better generalization is a significant departure from existing work. The literature review confirms that current methods primarily focus on clipping, normalization, ensuring stability, or analyzing convergence *despite* heavy tails. HTGA proposes a fundamentally different interaction with the tail properties, making the approach highly novel."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in empirical observations of heavy-tailed gradients and theoretical concepts linking optimization dynamics to generalization. The proposed methodology (using tail index estimators like Hill, adaptive modulation) is plausible. The experimental design is rigorous. However, the soundness relies partly on the heuristic design of the modulation function \\\\\\\\gamma(\\\\\\\\hat{\\\\\\\\alpha}_t) and the assumption that the online tail index estimate will be sufficiently stable and informative. The theoretical analysis is acknowledged as preliminary and challenging, which is reasonable but indicates that formal guarantees are not yet established. The inclusion of \\\\\\\\tau_t shows foresight regarding stability."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing deep learning frameworks and hardware. The main challenges lie in implementing an efficient and robust online tail index estimator (potential computational overhead and sensitivity to noise are concerns, though acknowledged) and the potentially complex hyperparameter tuning process involving several new parameters (\\\\\\\\alpha_{target}, \\\\\\\\beta, \\\\\\\\gamma_{max}, \\\\\\\\gamma_{min}, W, k, \\\\\\\\tau_t). These challenges require careful engineering and experimentation but seem surmountable, placing the feasibility as good but not excellent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely question regarding the role of heavy tails in deep learning optimization and generalization. If successful, HTGA could offer a novel and effective optimization algorithm, potentially leading to improved model performance. More importantly, it could contribute to a paradigm shift in how heavy tails are viewed and utilized in ML, directly aligning with the workshop's goals. The research has strong potential to advance both practical optimization techniques and the theoretical understanding of deep learning dynamics."
