    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call to re-evaluate heavy tails as potentially beneficial rather than purely problematic, focusing on their role in optimization dynamics and generalization. The proposal perfectly embodies the research idea of HTGA, aiming to leverage heavy tails. It effectively positions itself within the provided literature, acknowledging existing work on stability analysis (Raj et al., 2023) and mitigation (Hübler et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2025) while clearly differentiating its approach as one of strategic amplification rather than suppression. The objectives and methodology directly stem from the core idea and address the themes highlighted in the task description and literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly written. The background, objectives, methodology (including the HTGA algorithm steps and update rule), and experimental design are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The core concept of dynamically adjusting optimization based on the estimated tail index is clearly articulated. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as detailing the planned theoretical analysis approach beyond stating the goal, but the overall proposal is highly comprehensible."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality. While the existence of heavy tails and adaptive optimization are known, the core idea of *dynamically amplifying* gradients based on a real-time *tail index estimate* specifically to *improve generalization* represents a fresh perspective. This contrasts significantly with the dominant approaches in the cited literature, which focus on analyzing stability under heavy tails or mitigating their perceived negative effects through clipping or normalization. The HTGA mechanism, particularly the multiplicative factor based on the ratio of target and estimated tail indices, appears to be a novel contribution to adaptive optimization strategies."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has gaps in its theoretical rigor. It builds upon the established observation of heavy tails in ML and uses a standard method (Hill estimator) for tail index estimation. The experimental design is reasonably rigorous. However, the theoretical justification for the specific HTGA update rule `(alpha_target / alpha_hat)^gamma` is missing; it's presented heuristically ('encourage exploration'). The proposal acknowledges the need for theoretical analysis (Objective 1, convergence guarantees) but doesn't outline the specific approach or preliminary results. Furthermore, potential issues with the Hill estimator (e.g., sensitivity to the parameter `k`) are not discussed. The soundness hinges significantly on the yet-to-be-developed theoretical backing and empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible. Implementing the Hill estimator periodically and modifying the gradient update rule are technically straightforward within standard deep learning frameworks. The required computational resources (A6000 GPUs) and datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet, Wikitext-2) are standard and accessible. The experimental plan is well-defined. The main risks lie in the theoretical analysis proving more complex than anticipated or the empirical results not demonstrating the expected benefits or revealing instability issues. Sensitivity to new hyperparameters (`alpha_target`, `gamma`, `k`, `K`) also poses a manageable risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant and timely question in deep learning: the role of heavy-tailed gradients in optimization and generalization. By challenging the conventional wisdom of mitigation and proposing a method to actively leverage heavy tails, the research has the potential for considerable impact. If successful, HTGA could offer a new tool for improving model generalization, particularly in low-data regimes, and could influence the design of future adaptive optimizers. The potential shift in perspective—viewing heavy tails as a controllable resource—is itself a significant contribution to the field."
