        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task focuses on understanding and leveraging heavy tails in machine learning, moving beyond viewing them merely as problematic phenomena. The idea directly addresses this by proposing to investigate the link between heavy-tailed activations and generalization, a specific topic listed in the task description ('Heavy tails and generalization'). It aims to reposition the understanding of heavy tails as potentially beneficial and controllable features for improving model performance (generalization, robustness), which perfectly matches the workshop's goal of breaking negative perceptions and advancing theory/methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (challenging the negative view of heavy tails), the core hypothesis (fatter tails correlate with richer features and better generalization), the proposed methodology (theoretical analysis, empirical correlation studies, novel regularizer development), and the expected outcomes (quantitative evidence, practical method). The steps are logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While the existence of heavy tails in DNNs is increasingly recognized, this proposal goes beyond observation. The novelty lies in (1) attempting to establish a formal theoretical link between activation tail indices and generalization bounds, (2) proposing to *actively control* or *encourage* specific heavy-tailed behavior through a novel regularization term, rather than just analyzing or mitigating it, and (3) specifically targeting improved generalization and robustness through this mechanism. It combines existing concepts (heavy tails, generalization, regularization) in a fresh way to explore a less-understood relationship."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible. Analyzing tail indices of activations in trained networks is achievable with established statistical methods. Training standard architectures (CNNs, ViTs) on benchmark datasets (ImageNet, OOD sets) is standard practice. Developing and implementing a new regularization term is a common research activity in ML, although designing one that effectively encourages 'structured' heavy tails without causing instability might require significant experimentation and tuning. Access to standard computational resources would be necessary but is typical for this kind of research. The theoretical part might be challenging but exploring it empirically is definitely feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and potential impact. Generalization remains a central challenge in deep learning, and improving robustness, particularly to out-of-distribution data, is critical. If successful, this research could provide fundamental insights into the role of heavy-tailed dynamics in learning and offer a novel, practical approach (the regularizer) to enhance model performance. Shifting the perspective on heavy tails from a nuisance to a potentially beneficial, controllable property would be a significant contribution to the field, directly aligning with the goals of the described workshop."
