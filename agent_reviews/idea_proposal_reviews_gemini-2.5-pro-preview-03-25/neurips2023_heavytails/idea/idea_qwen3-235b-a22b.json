        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed, including 'Heavy tails in stochastic optimization', 'Heavy tails and generalization', 'Heavy-tailed continuous dynamical systems' (via SDEs), and implicitly touches upon 'Edge of stability' and 'understanding learning dynamics'. The motivation explicitly aligns with the workshop's goal of understanding the potentially *beneficial* roles of heavy tails and moving beyond viewing them merely as a 'phenomenon' by proposing a theoretical framework and practical investigation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-defined, the main idea is broken down into three distinct and understandable components (quantification, geometric relation, theoretical development), and the methodology outlines specific experiments and goals (model types, hyperparameter isolation, new optimizer design). The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. While using technical terms like 'Lévy processes', these are appropriate for the target audience and the overall research plan is unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While the observation of heavy tails in SGD and their potential link to generalization exists, the proposed approach offers fresh perspectives. Specifically, the use of SDEs driven by Lévy processes to formally connect landscape geometry and tail heaviness, the conceptualization of 'implicit heavy-tail regularization', and the proposal to design optimizers with *adaptive tail-index control* represent significant innovative steps beyond merely observing or characterizing the phenomenon. It aims to build a predictive and controllable framework."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some significant research challenges. Quantifying tail indices and running experiments on standard architectures are practical, albeit potentially computationally intensive. The main challenges lie in the theoretical development: rigorously establishing the geometric relationships using Lévy SDEs and deriving theoretical guarantees on generalization bounds dependent on tail exponents could be mathematically demanding. Designing and effectively tuning new optimization algorithms with adaptive tail-index control also poses practical hurdles. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable within a dedicated research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Understanding the mechanisms behind generalization in deep learning remains a central open problem. Linking optimization dynamics, particularly the role of heavy tails often dismissed as noise, to generalization through a rigorous theoretical and empirical framework could provide fundamental insights. If successful, developing optimization strategies that leverage heavy-tailed phases could lead to practical improvements in model training, robustness, and out-of-distribution performance. It directly addresses a core puzzle in modern machine learning highlighted by the task description."
