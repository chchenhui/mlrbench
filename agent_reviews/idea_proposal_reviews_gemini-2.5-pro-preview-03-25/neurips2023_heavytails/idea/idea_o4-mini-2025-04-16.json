        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses key workshop topics like 'Heavy tails in stochastic optimization' and 'Heavy tails and generalization'. The proposal aims to deliberately harness heavy-tailed behavior in SGD, moving beyond viewing it as just a 'phenomenon', which perfectly matches the workshop's goal of repositioning the understanding and application of heavy tails in ML optimization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of Gaussian noise in SGD, empirical observations of heavy tails) is clear. The core proposal (replacing Gaussian noise with adaptive α-stable noise) is well-defined. The mechanism for adaptation (based on local variance and curvature) and the theoretical approach (fractional Fokker-Planck) are stated, providing a good understanding of the proposed work, although specific details of the adaptation rule would require further elaboration in a full paper."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using heavy-tailed distributions (like α-stable) in optimization exists, the specific proposal to *adapt* the stability parameter α *online* within SGD based on *local landscape properties* (gradient variance, curvature) for deep learning optimization appears novel. Framing heavy tails as a controllable, adaptive mechanism for balancing exploration/exploitation in DL, rather than just an observed artifact, offers a fresh perspective. The proposed theoretical link via fractional Fokker-Planck equations also adds to the novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Implementing SGD with α-stable noise is possible using existing numerical libraries. Estimating gradient variance is standard. The main challenge lies in efficiently and effectively estimating local curvature and designing a robust online adaptation rule for α based on these estimates. While techniques for curvature estimation exist, their computational overhead and effectiveness in this specific adaptive scheme need investigation. The experimental validation on standard benchmarks is standard practice and feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Improving the generalization and robustness of SGD, the foundational optimizer for deep learning, would be a major contribution. By providing a principled method to leverage heavy-tailed noise, the research could lead to more effective training strategies for complex models and loss landscapes. Successfully linking the adaptive mechanism to theoretical guarantees (escape times) would deepen the understanding of optimization dynamics. This work has the potential for broad impact across machine learning applications."
