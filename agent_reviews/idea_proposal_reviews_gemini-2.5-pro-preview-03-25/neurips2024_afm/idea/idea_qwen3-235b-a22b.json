    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core topic of 'Continual Weight Updates' by proposing a method to adapt foundation models to new information while mitigating catastrophic forgetting and computational cost. It also implicitly relates to 'Efficient Fine-Tuning' through its focus on lightweight modules and sparse updates. The motivation aligns perfectly with the task's emphasis on adapting models to dynamic environments and evolving knowledge, fitting squarely within the scope of 'Adaptive Foundation Models'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main concept (modular architecture, dynamic routing, sparse updates, pruning), methodology components, and expected outcomes/impact are articulated concisely and logically. The flow from problem to proposed solution is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities might exist in the precise implementation details of the router mechanism or the meta-learning objective for module compatibility, but the overall concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several existing concepts (modular architectures, dynamic routing/MoE, sparse updates, meta-learning) in a specific configuration tailored for continual learning in foundation models. While individual components are not entirely new, their integration—using a trainable router to dynamically select among continually added, sparsely updated modules trained via meta-learning for compatibility—offers a fresh perspective on tackling catastrophic forgetting and efficiency simultaneously in large models. It moves beyond static modular approaches or simple fine-tuning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current machine learning techniques. Modular networks, routing mechanisms, sparse updates, and meta-learning are all established concepts. However, implementing and training this system effectively on large-scale foundation models presents non-trivial engineering and research challenges. Training the router efficiently, managing a potentially growing number of modules, ensuring stable meta-learning across tasks, and optimizing sparse updates at scale require careful design and experimentation. It's feasible but requires significant effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it targets two critical bottlenecks in the practical deployment of adaptive foundation models: catastrophic forgetting and the computational cost of frequent updates. Successfully developing such a system would enable more practical lifelong learning for large models, unlocking applications requiring real-time adaptation, personalization, and continuous knowledge integration without constant, expensive retraining. This directly addresses the core goals outlined in the task description and could lead to major advancements in adaptive AI."
