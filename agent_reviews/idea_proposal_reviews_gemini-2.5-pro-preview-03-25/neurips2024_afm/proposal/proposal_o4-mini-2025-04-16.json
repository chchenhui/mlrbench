    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (focusing on adaptive FMs, efficient fine-tuning, personalization), the research idea (Dynamic Sparse Adapters for scalable personalization), and the literature review (addressing challenges like efficiency vs. performance, scalability, dynamic adaptation). It directly tackles the core themes of efficient adaptation and personalization for foundation models, using techniques relevant to the workshop topics. The objectives, methodology, and evaluation plan are all consistent with the stated goals and the context provided."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific, the methodology section details the architecture (DSA), initialization (MAML), and optimization (RL) components with mathematical formulations, and the evaluation plan is comprehensive. The overall structure is logical. Minor areas for improvement include slightly more detail on the exact interplay and scheduling between the MAML and RL training phases in the algorithm description, and perhaps refining the description of how user-specific adapters \\\\phi_i relate to the meta-learned initialization \\\\phi_0 throughout the process."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. The core idea of using *dynamic*, user-conditioned sparse adapters, where pathways are selected by an RL-optimized gating network based on user embeddings, represents a significant departure from existing PEFT methods like LoRA (dense adapters) or AdaLoRA (adaptive budget allocation but not dynamic pathway selection per user). The combination of meta-learning for fast initialization and reinforcement learning for optimizing the discrete, sparse gating policy is a sophisticated and novel methodological contribution in this context."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established concepts (adapters, sparsity, MAML, RL, HardConcrete gates). The proposed methodology, including the DSA architecture and the combined MAML/RL training strategy, is technically well-founded. The mathematical formulations appear correct. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and includes relevant baselines and metrics. Potential challenges exist in the practical training stability of combining MAML and RL, and tuning the RL component, but the overall approach is robust and theoretically justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing deep learning frameworks and pre-trained models. Implementing the components (MLP gating, HardConcrete, MAML, REINFORCE) is achievable. However, the combined MAML and RL training process is known to be complex and computationally intensive, requiring significant GPU resources and careful tuning for stable convergence. Simulating a large number of users and benchmarking across diverse hardware adds practical challenges, but these seem manageable within a well-resourced research environment. The main risk lies in the complexity of optimization and achieving the desired efficiency gains without sacrificing performance."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: enabling scalable, efficient personalization of powerful foundation models. This is crucial for deploying advanced AI in real-world, user-centric applications, especially on resource-constrained devices. If successful, the DSA framework could lead to major advancements by drastically reducing the memory and computational overhead per user (potential 5-10x reduction cited), democratizing personalized AI, improving continual learning capabilities, and potentially enhancing privacy. The potential impact is substantial and aligns perfectly with current trends in AI research."
