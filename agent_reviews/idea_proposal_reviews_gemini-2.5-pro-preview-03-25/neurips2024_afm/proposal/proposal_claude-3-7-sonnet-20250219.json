        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of 'Personalized Adaptation' and 'Efficient Fine-Tuning' from the task description. It elaborates precisely on the research idea of 'Dynamic Sparse Adapters' for scalable personalization. Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as balancing efficiency and performance, scalability, and dynamic adaptation mechanisms, positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the Dynamic Sparse Adapters (DSA) framework, including mathematical formulations, meta-learning, reinforcement learning aspects, adapter architecture, data handling, and a comprehensive experimental design. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like sparse methods, adapters, meta-learning, and reinforcement learning exist, their specific integration for scalable personalization is innovative. The core novelty lies in the concept of *dynamic* sparse adapters where an RL agent learns a user-specific gating policy to select sparse pathways, aiming for extreme memory efficiency. This dynamic, context-aware sparsity control distinguishes it from static PEFT methods or adaptive budget allocation techniques mentioned in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established techniques like adapter-based tuning, meta-learning (MAML-like), and reinforcement learning (PPO, Gumbel-Softmax). The mathematical formulation is coherent, and the proposed RL approach to handle the discrete selection/sparsity constraint is appropriate. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics, ablation studies, and hyperparameter tuning, indicating methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Integrating and effectively training the meta-learning and reinforcement learning components simultaneously can be complex, potentially requiring significant tuning for stability and convergence. Efficient implementation of the dynamic gating mechanism also requires careful engineering. While the data requirements seem manageable and computational resources (A100 GPUs) are specified, the technical complexity introduces manageable risks regarding achieving optimal performance and stability."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical bottleneck of scalability in personalized foundation models, a major hurdle for widespread deployment, especially on resource-constrained devices. If successful, the proposed DSA method could drastically reduce memory costs (potential 5-10x reduction claimed), democratize access to personalized AI, enable edge deployment, and offer substantial cost savings for large-scale services. The potential contributions to both algorithmic development and practical applications are substantial."
