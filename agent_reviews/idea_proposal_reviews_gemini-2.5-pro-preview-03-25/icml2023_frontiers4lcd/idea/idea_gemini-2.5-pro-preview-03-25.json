    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the intersection of Learning (Diffusion Models, Reinforcement Learning), Control (Control Policies, Optimal Control), and Dynamical Systems (complex systems). The core proposal utilizes Diffusion Models and Reinforcement Learning, both explicitly listed as relevant topics for the workshop. It aims to enhance control algorithms using modern machine learning techniques, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of exploring the mutual relationship between these fields."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, outlining the limitations of existing methods. The core concept of using a conditional diffusion model as a policy, mapping states/goals to action distributions by reversing a diffusion process, is clearly presented. The expected benefits (exploration, stochasticity, robustness) are also stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific adaptation of dynamic programming or policy gradients for training these diffusion-based policies, but this level of detail is often elaborated upon in a full paper rather than an initial idea description."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models are established in generative modeling and RL is standard for control, formulating the control policy *itself* as a conditional diffusion model to generate actions is a relatively recent and innovative direction. It moves beyond using diffusion for planning or trajectory optimization to directly representing the policy. This specific approach leverages the generative nature of diffusion models for inherent stochasticity and potentially improved exploration in control, offering a fresh perspective compared to standard policy representations (e.g., Gaussian or deterministic policies)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Diffusion models are computationally intensive, both for training and sampling. Sampling an action might require multiple reverse steps, potentially hindering real-time control applications unless efficient sampling techniques are employed or adapted. Training such a model, especially integrating it with RL algorithms like policy gradients or value-based methods adapted for diffusion processes, requires significant algorithmic development and potentially large amounts of data or simulation time. While the components exist, their effective and efficient integration for control is a non-trivial research challenge."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Developing robust, sample-efficient control policies for complex, high-dimensional systems is a critical challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. If successful, this approach could offer a new class of policies with desirable properties like inherent stochasticity (useful for robustness and exploration) and the ability to model complex action distributions. It addresses key limitations of current methods and could lead to meaningful advancements in reinforcement learning and control theory, particularly for challenging tasks requiring exploration and robustness."
