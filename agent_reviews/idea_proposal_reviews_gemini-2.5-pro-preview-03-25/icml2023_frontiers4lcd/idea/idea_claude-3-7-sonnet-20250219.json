        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the limitations of existing Neural ODEs. The proposed solution, Adaptive Hybrid Neural ODEs (AH-NODEs), is well-defined, explaining its core components (mode detection network, hierarchical adaptation, transition function) and their intended functions. The objectives (efficiency, accuracy for complex/hybrid systems) are explicitly stated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While adaptive solvers and Neural ODEs exist, the proposed integration of a *learnable* mode detection network to dynamically switch integration strategies and explicitly handle discontinuities within a unified Neural ODE framework is innovative. Combining hierarchical time-step adaptation based on learned system properties represents a fresh approach compared to standard Neural ODE implementations or traditional adaptive solvers."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current deep learning frameworks and differential equation libraries. However, implementing and training the proposed AH-NODE architecture presents non-trivial challenges. Integrating the learnable mode detector, the adaptive solver, and the discontinuity handling mechanism requires careful engineering. Training stability, especially around mode switches and discontinuities, might require sophisticated techniques and careful tuning. Access to suitable datasets for complex/hybrid systems is also crucial."

        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Addressing the computational inefficiency and limitations in handling complex/hybrid dynamics of standard Neural ODEs is an important problem. If successful, AH-NODEs could make Neural ODEs significantly more practical and applicable to challenging real-world problems in science and engineering (e.g., biology, robotics), representing a meaningful advancement in learning dynamical systems."
