        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task calls for submissions at the intersection of learning, control, and dynamical systems, specifically mentioning 'Stochastic Optimal Control', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Stochastic Processes', and 'Neural SDEs' as relevant topics. The idea explicitly proposes integrating Reinforcement Learning (learning) with Stochastic Optimal Control (control) using Stochastic Differential Equations (dynamical systems), directly hitting the core theme and multiple listed topics of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation logically sets up the problem, and the main idea is broken down into four distinct, understandable steps (modeling, formulation, learning, evaluation). The expected outcomes and potential impact are also clearly stated. The only minor lack of detail is in the specifics of 'combining neural networks with control theory techniques' in step 3, but the overall framework and goals are exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by proposing a specific framework integrating RL and SOC using SDEs and deep learning. While the general concept of connecting RL and control/SOC is not entirely new (e.g., links between Q-learning and HJB equations, path integral methods), the proposed synthesis involving SDE modeling, SOC formulation, and a deep learning approximation tailored for this structure offers a fresh perspective and a potentially novel algorithmic contribution. It's more of an innovative combination and refinement than a completely groundbreaking concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Modeling systems with SDEs, formulating SOC problems, and using deep learning for approximation are all established techniques, albeit advanced ones. Integrating them poses engineering and theoretical challenges (e.g., ensuring stability, computational cost, handling high dimensions effectively), but it builds on existing knowledge and tools. It requires significant expertise but seems achievable within the current state of ML and control research."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear potential impact. Improving the robustness, efficiency, and ability of RL algorithms to handle uncertainty and high-dimensional state spaces is a critical challenge in the field. Success in this research could lead to more capable RL agents applicable to complex real-world problems (e.g., robotics, finance, autonomous systems) where stochasticity is inherent. It directly addresses a key area of development at the intersection of learning and control."
