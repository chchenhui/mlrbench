        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the intersection of learning (diffusion models, neural SDEs), control (stochastic optimal control), and dynamical systems (learning dynamics, trajectory generation). It explicitly mentions several key topics listed in the call (Stochastic Optimal Control, Diffusion Models, Neural ODEs/SDEs, Stochastic Processes) and fits perfectly within the workshop's theme of exploring the mutual relationship between these fields."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem and the proposed solution's rationale. The main idea is broken down into three understandable steps (dynamics learning, diffusion model training, control optimization). The conditioning aspects and the role of the diffusion model are well-defined. The expected outcomes and application areas are specific. Minor details about the exact optimization procedure could be elaborated, but the core concept is crystal clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using diffusion models for generation and neural SDEs/ODEs for dynamics are known techniques, their integration into a unified framework for trajectory-conditioned stochastic control is innovative. Applying diffusion models specifically to generate diverse future state trajectories for control optimization under uncertainty, conditioned on controls and history, represents a fresh perspective compared to traditional stochastic control methods or simpler generative models. It builds upon recent advancements but proposes a distinct and promising combination."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Training neural SDEs/ODEs and diffusion models on trajectory data is achievable with current techniques. However, training diffusion models, especially conditioned ones on potentially high-dimensional state-action sequences, can be computationally intensive and require substantial data. Furthermore, the control optimization step, involving repeated sampling from the diffusion model within potentially a model-predictive control loop, could be computationally demanding, potentially limiting real-time applicability without significant algorithmic optimizations or approximations. Integrating these complex components effectively also requires careful engineering."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds excellent significance and impact potential. It tackles the critical and long-standing challenge of optimal control for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems under complex uncertainty and partial observability, which is central to robotics, autonomous systems, and finance. By leveraging the power of diffusion models to capture intricate distributions and dependencies, the proposed approach could lead to more robust, adaptive, and data-efficient control policies compared to traditional methods relying on simplifying assumptions (e.g., Gaussian noise). Success would represent a major advancement in data-driven stochastic control."
