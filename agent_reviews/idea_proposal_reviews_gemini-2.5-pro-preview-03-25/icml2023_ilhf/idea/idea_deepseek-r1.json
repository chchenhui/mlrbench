        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Interactive Learning with Implicit Human Feedback' by proposing a method to learn from multimodal cues (speech, facial expressions, gaze) instead of hand-crafted rewards. It explicitly tackles key questions raised in the task description, such as learning from initially unknown/ambiguous feedback signals, handling non-stationarity (via meta-learning), and designing intrinsic reward systems for social alignment. The motivation and proposed outcomes resonate strongly with the workshop's goals of moving beyond traditional RL rewards and leveraging rich human signals for interaction-grounded learning."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation, main idea, methodology, and expected impact are distinct and logically connected. The core concept of using a transformer to encode multimodal feedback into a latent space for intrinsic reward learning via IRL and meta-learning is understandable. The example of the robot tutor aids comprehension. While the overall framework is clear, specific details regarding the transformer architecture, the exact IRL formulation, or the meta-learning algorithm could be further elaborated for perfect clarity, but the current level is good for a research idea proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like multimodal learning, transformers, IRL, and meta-learning exist individually, their proposed integration for learning *intrinsic* rewards directly from *implicit, socially rich* multimodal feedback *without predefined semantics* is innovative. Specifically, using IRL to interpret ambiguous social cues as rewards and meta-learning to adapt this interpretation dynamically offers a fresh perspective compared to standard approaches relying on explicit feedback or predefined reward mappings. The focus on 'socially-aligned' intrinsic rewards derived this way is a key novel contribution."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Collecting synchronized, high-quality multimodal interaction data (speech, gaze, facial expressions) is resource-intensive and technically demanding. Training large transformer models on such data, combined with contrastive learning, IRL, and meta-RL, requires substantial computational power and expertise. Evaluating the learned intrinsic reward function is inherently difficult due to the lack of ground truth for implicit intent. While the individual techniques are established, their integration into a robust, real-time interactive system is ambitious and requires considerable effort and potentially new methodological refinements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental limitation in interactive AI systems â€“ the reliance on explicit or hand-engineered rewards. Successfully learning meaningful intrinsic rewards from natural, implicit human feedback would represent a major advancement, enabling AI systems to become more adaptive, intuitive, and socially aware. The potential impact spans critical domains like assistive robotics, personalized education, and healthcare, aligning with the task's emphasis on real-world applications and socially integrated AI. It directly tackles core research challenges highlighted in the task description."
