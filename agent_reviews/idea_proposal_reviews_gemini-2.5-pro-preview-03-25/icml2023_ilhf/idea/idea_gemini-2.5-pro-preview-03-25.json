        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Interactive Learning with Implicit Human Feedback', focusing specifically on ambiguous signals like gaze and facial expressions, which are explicitly mentioned as relevant topics. The idea tackles key questions posed in the task description, such as learning from signals whose meanings are initially unknown or ambiguous, and balancing pre-training (meta-learning across users) versus interactive personalization (few-shot adaptation). It proposes a concrete approach to leverage rich, high-dimensional implicit feedback beyond simple rewards."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation highlights the specific problem of ambiguous, user-specific implicit feedback. The main idea explains the proposed solution (meta-learning for personalized interpretation) and its mechanism (few-shot adaptation). Key components like the base model, meta-learner, adaptation process, and integration with a primary agent are mentioned. While specific algorithmic details or architectural choices are not elaborated, the core concept and its rationale are easily understandable with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While meta-learning for personalization and using implicit feedback are existing research areas, the specific application of meta-learning to train an *interpreter* model that adapts few-shot to *ambiguous*, high-dimensional implicit signals during interaction is innovative. It moves beyond simply using signals as rewards, focusing instead on learning the personalized *meaning* or grounding of these signals rapidly. This combination offers a fresh perspective on handling user-specific nuances in implicit communication within interactive learning loops."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current ML techniques. Meta-learning algorithms are well-established, and methods for processing gaze and facial data exist. However, practical implementation faces challenges. Collecting diverse, high-quality interaction data across many users for meta-training can be resource-intensive. Ensuring the few-shot adaptation is sufficiently fast and robust for real-time interaction requires efficient models and careful algorithmic design. Integrating the interpreter seamlessly with a primary learning agent also needs careful engineering. While challenging, these hurdles seem surmountable with dedicated effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Effectively interpreting ambiguous and personalized implicit feedback is a major bottleneck for creating truly natural and adaptive human-AI interaction. Success in this area could lead to substantial improvements in various applications, including assistive technologies, educational software, collaborative robotics, and personalized interfaces. By enabling systems to quickly understand individual users' subtle cues, the research directly addresses a critical challenge highlighted in the task description and could foster major advancements in interactive AI systems."
