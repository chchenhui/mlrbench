    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of learning from implicit, multimodal human feedback, tackling key issues highlighted in the task description such as non-stationarity (via Meta-RL), unknown feedback grounding (via IRL), social alignment, and multimodal signal integration (via contrastive learning). The objectives, methodology, and expected impact clearly stem from the research idea and address challenges identified in the literature (data inefficiency, non-stationarity, multimodal fusion), citing relevant papers (Abramson et al., Lee et al.) and proposing comparisons against appropriate baselines (PEBBLE, MIA, EEG-RL). It comprehensively covers the requirements, showing a deep understanding of the context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, the methodology is broken down into logical stages (encoding, IRL, meta-RL), and the experimental design is outlined. Key concepts like contrastive learning, IRL, and meta-adaptation are introduced with relevant formulations. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for pre-training the reward predictor using post-hoc ratings versus learning purely implicitly, and some details of the Meta-Neural Process are assumed known. However, the overall research plan and rationale are clearly articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced techniques in a novel combination to address learning from implicit multimodal feedback. While components like contrastive learning for multimodal data, IRL, and Meta-RL exist individually, their specific application here—using contrastive learning to create a latent space from naturalistic implicit cues (speech, gaze, face, gestures), feeding this into IRL to learn an intrinsic reward function without explicit labels, and using Meta-RL for adapting this implicitly derived reward—represents a fresh approach. It moves beyond existing work focusing on explicit feedback (RLHF, PEBBLE), single implicit modalities (EEG-RL), or imitation learning (MIA), offering a distinct method for achieving socially aligned interactive learning."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound theoretical foundations, employing well-established methods like contrastive learning, maximum entropy IRL, and Meta-RL (specifically MNP) with PPO for optimization. The technical formulations presented (contrastive loss, meta-update) are standard. The methodology is generally rigorous. However, the core assumption that complex, noisy, multimodal implicit human cues can be reliably encoded into a latent space that allows for the inference of a meaningful and actionable reward function via IRL is strong and introduces uncertainty. The reliance on post-hoc annotations for pre-training the reward predictor also slightly complicates the 'implicit feedback' narrative and needs careful handling. While the components are sound, their successful integration for this specific purpose carries inherent challenges."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Collecting synchronized, high-quality multimodal data (speech, gaze, face, gestures) requires specialized equipment (Tobii, Kinect, OpenFace) and careful experimental setup, potentially involving human subjects. Simulating realistic implicit feedback is non-trivial. The proposed model architecture, combining multimodal transformers, contrastive learning, IRL, and Meta-RL, is complex and computationally intensive to train, requiring substantial engineering effort and compute resources. The suggested pre-training data size (500+ interactions) might be insufficient for the complexity of the models. While technically plausible with adequate resources and expertise, the integration complexity and data requirements pose considerable risks to successful execution within a typical project scope."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in interactive AI: enabling agents to learn from natural, implicit human cues rather than relying solely on explicit, often burdensome, feedback. Success would represent a major advancement towards more intuitive, personalized, and socially intelligent AI systems. The potential impact spans crucial domains like education (adaptive tutors), healthcare (assistive robotics sensitive to discomfort), and general HCI, improving human-AI collaboration and accessibility (reducing barriers for users unable to provide explicit feedback). The research directly tackles core questions outlined in the task description regarding interaction-grounded learning and social alignment, promising substantial contributions."
