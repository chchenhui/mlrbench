    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of learning from implicit, multimodal human feedback without pre-specified semantics, tackling non-stationarity via meta-learning, and aiming for social alignment – all key themes in the task description. The methodology incorporates techniques (multimodal transformers, IRL, meta-RL) mentioned or implied in the idea and supported by the literature review (referencing relevant papers like Abramson et al., Finn et al., and acknowledging challenges like interpretation and adaptation). It effectively translates the high-level idea into a concrete research plan consistent with the provided context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology is broken down into logical components (Data Collection, Encoder, IRL, Meta-RL) with sufficient technical detail, including model architectures, loss functions (InfoNCE, MaxEnt IRL), and algorithms (Algorithm 1, MAML procedure). The experimental design is specific regarding environments, baselines, metrics, and analysis. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity about the proposed work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing advanced techniques in a novel configuration to address a specific gap. While components like multimodal transformers, contrastive learning, IRL, and meta-learning exist individually (as shown in the literature review), their synthesis here – specifically using IRL to learn intrinsic rewards directly from *implicit* multimodal feedback (visual, audio, gaze) and combining this with meta-RL for rapid adaptation in this context – represents a fresh approach. It moves beyond standard RLHF with explicit feedback or single implicit modalities, offering a distinct contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound and rigorous foundations. It leverages well-established methods like transformer architectures for multimodal fusion, contrastive learning (InfoNCE) for representation learning, Maximum Entropy IRL for reward inference, and MAML for meta-learning. The technical formulations presented (equations for losses, updates) are standard and appear correct. The overall methodological approach is logically coherent and theoretically grounded in relevant ML literature. Minor uncertainties might exist regarding the practical stability and sample efficiency of integrating IRL and meta-RL in this specific complex setup, but the core methodology is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Collecting synchronized, high-quality multimodal data (video, audio, gaze) requires specialized equipment and careful experimental setup, especially for the real-world robot experiments. Integrating the different complex components (multimodal processing, contrastive pre-training, IRL, meta-RL) into a working system demands substantial engineering effort and computational resources. IRL can be computationally intensive and sensitive to hyperparameters. While conceptually sound, the practical execution, debugging, and tuning of such a system, particularly achieving robust real-world performance, pose considerable risks and require significant expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: enabling AI agents to learn from natural, implicit human cues. Success would be impactful, potentially leading to more intuitive, adaptive, and socially aligned AI systems in critical domains like assistive robotics, education, and healthcare. By reducing reliance on explicit feedback, it tackles a major bottleneck in interactive ML. The research has the potential for substantial scientific contributions (understanding implicit feedback, novel framework) and practical applications, aligning well with the goals outlined in the task description."
