    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the task description, focusing on key workshop topics like diffusion model theory, methodology (novel architectures, inference), and applications (inverse problems, image editing). It directly elaborates on the research idea, detailing the motivation, core concept (injective Neural ODEs for inversion/editing), and expected outcomes. It also addresses challenges and builds upon concepts mentioned in the literature review (e.g., exact inversion methods like EDICT, Lipschitz regularization, Neural ODEs). The methodology and objectives are consistent with the goal of achieving exact inversion and precise editing using the proposed framework."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated precisely. The methodology section provides a structured overview of the data, model architecture (including mathematical formulations for the Neural ODE and loss function), inversion/editing process, and experimental design (baselines, metrics, ablations). The expected outcomes and broader impact are also clearly stated. The language is concise, and the structure is logical, making it easy to understand the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal combines existing concepts (Neural ODEs, diffusion models, Lipschitz regularization, injective mappings) in a specific way to tackle exact inversion and editing. While the combination itself might offer some novelty, the literature review provided significantly undermines the claim of originality. Specifically, it includes multiple papers on exact/near-exact diffusion inversion (EDICT, BDIA, ERDDCI) and, critically, a paper (#10) with the *exact same title* and a highly similar summary from 2023. This suggests the core idea may not be novel or the proposal fails to adequately differentiate itself from very recent, directly relevant work presented in its own literature review. The proposal needs to explicitly clarify its unique contributions compared to these existing methods, especially paper #10."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is based on sound theoretical foundations (Neural ODEs, diffusion models, Lipschitz continuity). The proposed methodology, involving an injective Neural ODE framework with Lipschitz-regularized score networks, is technically plausible. Using spectral normalization and Lipschitz penalties to promote stability and invertibility is a standard and reasonable approach. However, ensuring practical injectivity for high-dimensional data with complex neural networks is non-trivial and relies heavily on the effectiveness of the architectural choices and regularization. The claim of 'exact' inversion might be limited by numerical precision of ODE solvers in practice. The technical formulations presented are standard but appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current ML techniques and computational resources, although challenging. Training Neural ODEs and diffusion models requires significant computational power. Implementing and verifying injectivity constraints adds complexity. The required datasets are publicly available. The experimental plan, including comparisons with relevant baselines (EDICT, Negative-prompt Inversion, ERDDCI) and standard metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID), is practical. Potential risks include the computational cost, achieving the targeted performance metrics, and ensuring the 'exactness' of inversion holds up against numerical errors."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in diffusion models: the lack of efficient, theoretically guaranteed methods for exact inversion and precise editing. Success in this area would have a substantial impact on applications requiring high fidelity and determinism, such as medical imaging, scientific simulation, and forensic analysis. It would also advance creative tools by enabling more controllable and localized image editing. The focus on theoretical guarantees (injectivity, stability) adds to its potential significance by providing a more rigorous foundation compared to purely empirical or approximate methods."
