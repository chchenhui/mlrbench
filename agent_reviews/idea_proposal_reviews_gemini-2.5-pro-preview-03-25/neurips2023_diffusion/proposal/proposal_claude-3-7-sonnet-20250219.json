    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description (workshop on diffusion models focusing on theory, methodology, inverse problems, and editing), the research idea (using injective Neural ODEs for exact inversion and editing), and the literature review (addressing limitations of prior work like ERDDCI, EDICT, etc., and leveraging concepts like Neural ODEs and Lipschitz regularization). It directly tackles the workshop's themes and builds logically upon the provided context and challenges identified in the literature."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, outlining objectives, methodology, and expected impact. The core idea of using injective Neural ODEs is explained. However, some technical details could be refined for perfect clarity, such as the precise relationship between the ODE function f_theta and the score network s_theta, and a more explicit derivation or justification for how the proposed architecture strictly guarantees the mathematical condition for injectivity. The experimental plan is clear."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The proposal's novelty is severely questionable due to the inclusion of a paper (Miller et al., 2023) in its own literature review that shares the exact same title and abstract. Without explicit clarification on how this proposal differs from or significantly extends Miller et al. (2023), the work cannot be considered novel. While the combination of injective Neural ODEs, conditional diffusion, and Lipschitz regularization for exact inversion is interesting and distinct from other cited methods (ERDDCI, EDICT, BDIA), the direct overlap with a cited work is a major issue. The score reflects this critical lack of demonstrated originality relative to the provided literature context."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is based on sound theoretical foundations (Neural ODEs, diffusion models, injectivity, Lipschitz continuity). The methodology, including the architectural design principles (though needing slightly more justification), conditional training, ODE integration for inversion, latent space editing, and Lipschitz regularization, is rigorous and technically plausible. The experimental design is comprehensive and uses appropriate metrics and comparisons, indicating a methodologically sound research plan."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal appears highly feasible. Implementing and training Neural ODEs and diffusion models, while computationally intensive (acknowledged by mentioning 8 A100 GPUs), is achievable with current ML frameworks and hardware. The techniques described (spectral norm, ODE solvers) are standard. Potential challenges exist in balancing constraints with model expressiveness and numerical precision during ODE integration, but these are typical research risks rather than fundamental roadblocks. The plan is realistic."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in diffusion models: the lack of guaranteed exact inversion for inverse problems and precise editing control. Solving this would be impactful for critical applications like medical imaging and forensics, and advance generative modeling capabilities. The potential contributions to theory (understanding injective diffusion) and practice (providing a reliable inversion/editing tool) are substantial and relevant to the field."
