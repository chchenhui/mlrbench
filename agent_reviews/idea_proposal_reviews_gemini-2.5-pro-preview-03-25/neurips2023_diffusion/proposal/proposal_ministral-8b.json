    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly consistent with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key topics mentioned in the workshop call (theory/methodology of diffusion models, novel architectures, inverse problems, image editing). It elaborates logically on the provided research idea, detailing the motivation, core concept (Injective Neural ODEs for exact inversion/editing), and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it positions itself clearly within the context of the provided literature review, aiming to tackle the identified challenges like exact inversion, theoretical guarantees, and localized editing."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear and well-structured. The objectives are specific and understandable. The methodology section outlines the main components and algorithmic steps. However, some technical details could be more explicit. For instance, the inversion step notation '\\(\\mathcal{O}(x_t, t)\\)' is abstract and could be defined more clearly (e.g., as backward ODE integration). The precise mechanism for ensuring injectivity via Lipschitz regularization could also be elaborated slightly. Overall, the proposal is understandable, but minor refinements would enhance clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The proposal suffers significantly in terms of novelty. The literature review provided includes a paper (entry #10) with the *exact same title* and a summary that mirrors the proposal's core idea and objectives almost perfectly ('Injective Neural ODE-based Conditional Diffusion Models for Scalable Inversion and Precise Image Editing', proposing an injective Neural ODE architecture for exact inversion and precise editing). This strongly suggests the proposal describes work that is already published (at least on arXiv) or submitted. While combining Neural ODEs, injectivity, and conditional diffusion for editing is specific, the proposal fails to differentiate itself from this highly relevant prior work cited within its own literature review. Without clear articulation of what *new* contribution is being proposed beyond this existing paper, the novelty is minimal."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is based on sound theoretical concepts. Using Neural ODEs to model continuous dynamics like diffusion processes is established. The goal of achieving invertibility through injective mappings (potentially enforced via Lipschitz continuity) is theoretically grounded. The conditional denoising objective is standard. The methodology appears plausible, leveraging known techniques. However, the proposal is light on the specific theoretical guarantees it aims to provide and how the Lipschitz regularization will concretely ensure injectivity and stability for this specific architecture. The technical formulations are brief but seem correct in principle."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents challenges. Training Neural ODEs and diffusion models, especially on high-resolution data, is computationally intensive. Ensuring numerical stability and achieving practical 'exact' inversion (within numerical precision) can be difficult. Lipschitz regularization adds implementation complexity. While the proposal mentions scalability as a goal, it doesn't detail specific strategies to overcome the inherent scaling challenges of these models. Access to significant computational resources and curated datasets would be necessary. The plan is outlined, but potential roadblocks related to computation and achieving theoretical guarantees in practice are not fully addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research addresses significant challenges in the diffusion model literature: exact inversion for inverse problems and precise, controllable image editing. Success in these areas would have a substantial impact, particularly for applications requiring high fidelity and reliability, such as medical imaging and forensics, as highlighted in the proposal. Improving the controllability and applicability of diffusion models to inverse problems is a highly relevant research direction. Therefore, the potential impact is high."
