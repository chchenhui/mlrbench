        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop on Diffusion Models covering theory, methodology, inverse problems, editing), the research idea (Injective Neural ODEs for exact inversion and editing), and the literature review (citing relevant works like EDICT, BDIA, ERDDCI, Lipschitz regularization, Neural ODEs). It directly addresses the core motivation and main idea presented, and its objectives and methodology are clearly derived from them. It fits perfectly within the workshop's scope and explicitly tackles challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured, clearly written, and presents the research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes logically. The core concepts (Neural ODEs, injectivity, Lipschitz regularization, conditional denoising, ODE reversal) are explained, and mathematical formulations are provided. The experimental design is detailed. While generally very clear, some intricate technical details regarding the practical enforcement of Lipschitz constraints or the precise mechanism of conditional information injection into the ODE might require further elaboration for full implementation clarity, but the overall proposal is highly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal suggests combining injective Neural ODEs, Lipschitz regularization, and conditional diffusion for guaranteed exact inversion and editing. This specific combination aimed at provable injectivity appears novel compared to cited approximation-based inversion methods (EDICT, BDIA, ERDDCI). However, the novelty score is moderated due to the presence of reference [10] ('Injective Neural ODE-based Conditional Diffusion Models...') which shares the exact title and core idea, potentially indicating prior work or less originality than claimed. Assuming [10] is preliminary or related work being extended, the proposal still offers a novel synthesis and focus on theoretical guarantees for inversion within this specific framework."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on solid theoretical foundations, leveraging ODE theory (Lipschitz condition for injectivity/bijectivity) and established diffusion model concepts. The use of Lipschitz regularization for stability is well-motivated and cited [6]. The methodology, including the Neural ODE forward process, conditional objective, and ODE reversal for inversion, is logically derived and technically plausible. Mathematical formulations are presented correctly. While practical implementation of Lipschitz constraints and ensuring numerical stability for ODE solvers are non-trivial challenges, the underlying theoretical approach is rigorous and sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal faces significant feasibility challenges. Training Neural ODEs, especially combined with large diffusion model backbones (like U-Nets), is computationally very expensive, requiring substantial GPU resources and time. Implementing and effectively enforcing Lipschitz constraints on complex neural networks is technically difficult. Debugging and stabilizing the training and inference (ODE solving) processes for such models can be complex. While standard datasets and metrics are proposed, the core technical implementation presents considerable hurdles, making the project ambitious and potentially resource-intensive."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and well-recognized limitation of diffusion models: the lack of guaranteed exact inversion. Achieving reliable, deterministic inversion would be highly significant, enabling applications in safety-critical domains (medical imaging, forensics) where approximation errors are unacceptable, and facilitating more precise and controllable image editing. Success would represent a major theoretical advancement (understanding invertible diffusion processes) and offer substantial practical benefits, strongly impacting both academic research and potential industrial applications."
