    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop themes on diffusion model theory, methodology, limitations, inverse problems, editing), the research idea (using injective Neural ODEs for exact inversion and editing), and the literature review (addressing challenges like exact inversion, theoretical guarantees, localized editing, and referencing relevant concepts like Neural ODEs, Lipschitz regularization, and prior inversion techniques). It systematically builds upon the provided context and aims to tackle the identified key challenges."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed, the methodology section details the theoretical framework (ICNOD), algorithmic steps, data, and evaluation plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise architecture for ensuring injectivity ('potential approach', 'alternatively') and the exact formulation linking the score network 's_theta' to the ODE field 'f_theta', but the overall research direction and plan are clearly articulated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "The proposal's novelty is severely undermined by the provided literature review, which includes a paper (Miller et al., 2023) with the exact same title ('Injective Neural ODE-based Conditional Diffusion Models for Scalable Inversion and Precise Image Editing') and a summary describing the core idea presented in this proposal. The proposal fails to differentiate itself or claim contributions beyond what appears to be already published work according to its own literature review. While it combines concepts (Neural ODEs, injectivity, conditioning, Lipschitz), this specific combination seems pre-existing, making the proposed work appear derivative rather than original."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established theoretical concepts like Neural ODEs, diffusion models, invertible transformations, score matching, and Lipschitz continuity. The proposed methodology of using an injective Neural ODE for deterministic forward/backward passes seems theoretically plausible for achieving exact inversion (up to numerical precision). The inclusion of Lipschitz regularization is appropriate for stability and theoretical guarantees. However, ensuring strict injectivity via learned networks across the entire ODE trajectory can be practically challenging, and the proposal relies on this assumption working effectively. The technical formulations are mostly correct conceptually, though some details could be more precise."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training high-dimensional Neural ODEs, especially with added constraints for injectivity and Lipschitz continuity, is computationally expensive. Scaling this approach to high-resolution images (e.g., 512x512 or 1024x1024) will require substantial computational resources and careful engineering. Ensuring numerical stability of the ODE solvers and the practical effectiveness of the injectivity constraints are non-trivial risks. While the components exist, their integration into a robust and scalable system requires considerable effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses significant limitations in current diffusion models regarding exact inversion for inverse problems and precise, controllable image editing. Success would represent a notable practical advancement, potentially enabling applications in high-fidelity domains like medical imaging and forensics. It also contributes theoretically by exploring the connection between diffusion models, ODEs, and invertibility. The significance is high due to the importance of the problem. However, the impact is somewhat moderated by the apparent lack of novelty, as the primary contribution might be empirical validation or refinement of an existing idea rather than a completely new direction."
