        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the ICML workshop's call to explore duality principles, specifically Lagrange duality for model explanation via sensitivity analysis, which the task description highlighted as under-exploited. It systematically elaborates on the core research idea, translating the concept of minimal perturbation and dual variables into a concrete methodology. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and cites relevant papers from the literature review (e.g., on sensitivity analysis, duality applications) and explicitly acknowledges the key challenges identified (non-convexity, computation), positioning the work within the current research landscape. The objectives and significance directly map to the goals outlined in the task and idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem definition to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem, the Lagrangian, and the dual problem is presented clearly. The proposed algorithm (LDE) is outlined step-by-step, including the rationale for using backpropagation. The handling of the non-convexity challenge is explicitly discussed. While the exact formulation of the final sensitivity score is left as an investigation point (which is acceptable at the proposal stage), the overall concept and approach are articulated with high precision and minimal ambiguity."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a notably original approach within the XAI field. While Lagrange duality is a classic optimization tool and sensitivity analysis is a known concept, the systematic application of Lagrange duality to the specific problem of finding minimal input perturbations to derive feature importance scores for general deep learning models appears novel. It distinguishes itself from standard gradient-based, perturbation-based, or propagation-based XAI methods by leveraging the theoretical framework of constrained optimization duality. The literature review confirms that while duality is used in specific ML contexts (e.g., kinetic equations, physics), its use for general DNN interpretability via sensitivity derived from dual variables is largely unexplored, as noted in the task description. The proposed LDE framework represents a fresh perspective."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on a solid theoretical foundation â€“ Lagrange duality from constrained optimization theory. The connection between dual variables and sensitivity of the optimal objective to constraint perturbations is theoretically well-established, particularly in convex settings. The proposed methodology, involving formulating an optimization problem and using dual ascent with gradient-based updates (via backpropagation), is technically sound. Crucially, the proposal acknowledges the non-convexity of DNNs and pragmatically focuses on local sensitivity analysis derived from local optima or KKT points, which is a reasonable and sound approach for interpretability near a specific input. The mathematical formulations are correct. The main uncertainty lies in how well the local sensitivity derived from the non-convex problem translates to reliable feature importance, but the proposed approach to investigate this is rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core algorithmic components rely on gradient computation (backpropagation) and standard optimization techniques (gradient descent/ascent), which are readily implementable using existing deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. The experimental plan uses standard datasets, models, and evaluation metrics common in XAI research. However, the proposed iterative dual ascent algorithm involves nested optimization loops (approximating the primal minimization within the dual update step), which could be computationally more intensive and potentially slower to converge than single-pass XAI methods. Tuning the optimization hyperparameters (step sizes, thresholds, number of iterations) might require significant effort. While feasible within a research context, these factors introduce moderate implementation challenges and potential computational overhead compared to simpler baselines."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: the lack of trustworthy and theoretically grounded explanations for deep neural networks. By proposing a novel method (LDE) based on Lagrange duality and sensitivity analysis, it has the potential to make substantial contributions. If successful, LDE could offer more robust and reliable explanations compared to existing methods, enhance model debugging capabilities, provide insights into model robustness, and bridge the gap between optimization theory and practical deep learning interpretability. This aligns perfectly with the goals of the ICML Duality Principles workshop and could stimulate further research. The potential impact on developing more trustworthy AI systems for critical applications is considerable."
