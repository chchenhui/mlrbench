    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for applying duality principles (specifically Lagrange duality) to deep learning for model explanation, a topic explicitly mentioned as underexplored. The methodology follows the research idea of framing feature importance as a minimal perturbation problem and using dual variables. It acknowledges the gap identified in the literature (lack of direct Lagrange duality application for DNN feature importance) and positions itself relative to existing sensitivity analysis methods, addressing the challenge of non-convexity via linearization as highlighted in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a clear step-by-step derivation of the primal and dual problems under local linearization, defines the feature importance score unambiguously, and outlines the algorithm. The experimental design is detailed and easy to follow, specifying datasets, models, baselines, metrics, and procedures. Mathematical notation is consistent and standard. While the implications of the local linearization could be slightly more elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Lagrange duality and local linearization are known concepts, their specific application to derive feature importance scores for deep neural networks by solving the dual of a linearized decision-flipping perturbation problem appears novel. It distinguishes itself from standard gradient/perturbation methods (LIME, SHAP, IG) by offering a duality-based perspective and potential theoretical certificates (within the linearized context). It also differs from the cited literature on sensitivity analysis which uses other approaches (set-valued, metric, topological) or applies duality in different contexts (physics-informed NNs, duality discovery)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in classical Lagrange duality theory. The derivation of the dual QP from the linearized primal problem is mathematically correct. The use of local linearization (first-order Taylor expansion) is a standard and necessary approximation technique for applying convex tools to non-convex DNNs, although it limits the theoretical guarantees to the local approximation. The interpretation of dual variables as sensitivities is appropriate in this context. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant baselines, metrics, and statistical analysis, providing a solid plan for empirical validation. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. The required computational steps (forward/backward passes, gradient computations, solving a moderate-sized QP) are well within the capabilities of standard deep learning frameworks (PyTorch) and readily available QP solvers (OSQP, or differentiable ones like qpth). The computational complexity, particularly the O(K^3) QP solve, is manageable for typical classification tasks where the number of classes K is not excessively large. The plan requires standard hardware and software resources, making it realistic to execute."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses the significant and widely recognized problem of interpretability in deep learning. By proposing a novel method grounded in Lagrange duality, it has the potential to provide explanations with better theoretical justification (related to sensitivity/robustness) compared to purely heuristic methods. Success could lead to more trustworthy AI systems, particularly in high-stakes domains. Furthermore, it directly contributes to the theme of the ICML workshop by reviving interest in duality principles for modern ML, potentially opening new research avenues in explanation, robustness, and beyond."
