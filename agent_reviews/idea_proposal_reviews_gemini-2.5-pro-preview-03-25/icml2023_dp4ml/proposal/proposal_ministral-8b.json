    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for applying duality principles (specifically Lagrange duality) to deep learning explanation, a topic explicitly mentioned as underutilized. The proposal faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. It also situates the work within the context of the literature review, acknowledging related sensitivity analysis and duality work while proposing a distinct approach aimed at overcoming identified challenges like computational cost and lack of theoretical guarantees in existing methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-structured and clearly written at a high level. The introduction, objectives, significance, evaluation plan, and expected outcomes are understandable. However, the core methodology section (3.1), particularly the problem formulation (3.1.1) and dual-space optimization (3.1.2), lacks sufficient detail and clarity. The formulation of the Lagrangian for the inequality constraint `f(x + δ) != f(x)` is ambiguous. The derivation and correctness of the presented dual problem are not shown and seem questionable. Furthermore, the crucial step of solving the dual problem via 'back-propagation in augmented network architectures' is mentioned but not explained, leaving a significant gap in understanding how the method actually works. This lack of technical detail in the central part of the methodology hinders a complete understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Lagrange duality is a known concept and sensitivity analysis is an active research area, the specific approach of framing feature importance as a minimal perturbation problem and then using the *dual variables* of this problem, purportedly solved via a specialized backpropagation scheme, as sensitivity scores for post-hoc explanation of general deep networks appears novel. This contrasts with standard gradient/LIME/SHAP methods and also differs from prior work using duality for optimization constraints during training (like paper #10 in the lit review) or using ML to discover dualities (paper #9). The novelty lies in the specific formulation and proposed solution method for interpretability."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The proposal has significant weaknesses in its technical soundness. Firstly, applying Lagrange duality rigorously often relies on convexity, which is absent in deep networks; the proposal doesn't adequately address how strong duality or meaningful bounds are obtained in this non-convex setting. Secondly, the mathematical formulation presented appears flawed or incomplete. The Lagrangian formulation for the inequality constraint is unclear. More critically, the derivation of the dual problem in section 3.1.2 from the Lagrangian in 3.1.1 is missing and the presented form seems inconsistent (e.g., the disappearance of `f(x+δ)` and appearance of `f(x)`). Thirdly, the claim that optimal dual variables `λ*` directly quantify feature importance lacks theoretical justification within the proposal. Finally, the core mechanism of solving the dual via backpropagation is asserted but not explained or justified, leaving its validity unevaluated. These issues cast serious doubt on the technical rigor of the proposed method."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is uncertain due to the lack of technical detail and potential soundness issues. While the experimental plan (datasets, models, evaluation metrics) is standard and feasible, the core methodological proposal – solving the specific dual problem via backpropagation in an augmented network – is not sufficiently described to assess its practicality. Implementing this requires a clear algorithm for the augmented network and the backpropagation process for the dual objective, which is missing. There's a risk that this core step is either theoretically flawed (as suggested by the Soundness score) or computationally much more complex than implied. The proposal acknowledges challenges like non-convexity and complexity but doesn't convincingly detail how its specific approach overcomes them."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: the interpretability of deep neural networks. Developing methods that provide theoretically grounded, computationally efficient, and robust explanations would be a major contribution. If successful, the proposed Lagrange Dual Explainers could offer substantial benefits over existing methods by providing provable bounds and potentially faster computation. The connection to classical duality principles is intellectually appealing and aligns well with the workshop's theme. The potential applications in regulatory compliance, model debugging, and general Explainable AI are impactful."
