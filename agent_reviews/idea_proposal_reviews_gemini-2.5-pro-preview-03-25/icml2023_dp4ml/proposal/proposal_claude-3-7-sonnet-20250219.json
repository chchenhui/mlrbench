        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for applying duality principles (specifically Lagrange duality) to model understanding and explanation in deep learning, a topic explicitly mentioned as underexplored. The proposal faithfully expands the core research idea into a detailed plan. It effectively positions itself within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging relevant work on sensitivity analysis and duality applications while highlighting its unique contribution and addressing key challenges like non-convexity identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a strong motivation and clear problem statement, followed by a detailed methodology, and concluding with expected outcomes. The mathematical formulations, while concise, are presented clearly. The objectives (provable bounds, efficiency, robustness) are explicitly stated. The experimental design is thorough and easy to understand. Minor details regarding the implementation of the Dual Network Architecture or second-order corrections could be expanded, but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Lagrangian duality and sensitivity analysis are established concepts, their systematic application as a unified framework ('Lagrange Dual Explainers') for deriving feature importance certificates with theoretical grounding in general deep neural networks appears novel. It distinguishes itself from existing gradient/perturbation methods by aiming for provable bounds via duality and from prior sensitivity work by leveraging the dual problem structure directly for computation (via the proposed Dual Network Architecture). The idea of framing interpretability as finding the minimal decision-altering perturbation and solving its dual is a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in classical optimization theory (Lagrangian duality). The formulation of the primal problem is standard. The use of local convex approximation (Taylor expansion) is a necessary and common technique for applying convex tools to DNNs, but it introduces approximation errors. The proposal acknowledges the non-convexity challenge and the duality gap, suggesting reasonable mitigation strategies (multi-scale linearization, second-order corrections, gap estimation), although their effectiveness and the strength of the 'provable bounds' claim beyond the local approximation require empirical validation. The experimental plan is rigorous and well-designed to test the approach. Technical formulations appear correct for the linearized case."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The core concepts rely on standard deep learning tools (gradient computation, network definition) and optimization principles. However, implementing the proposed 'Dual Network Architecture' efficiently and integrating the methods for handling non-convexity (multi-scale analysis, second-order corrections) will require significant technical expertise and computational resources, especially for large models (Transformers, ImageNet). The computational cost of solving the dual problem, even with the proposed architecture, needs careful evaluation. The plan is generally realistic, but complexity and resource requirements are notable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and persistent challenge of deep learning interpretability, which is crucial for trust, debugging, safety, and regulatory compliance in AI. By proposing a method grounded in mathematical duality with potential for theoretical guarantees, efficiency, and robustness, it could lead to major advancements over existing heuristic methods. Success would provide a valuable tool for responsible AI development and deployment, strengthen the connection between optimization theory and deep learning, and directly contribute to the workshop's themes."
