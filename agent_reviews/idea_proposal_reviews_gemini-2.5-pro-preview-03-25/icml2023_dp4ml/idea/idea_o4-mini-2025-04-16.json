        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for applications of duality principles, including Lagrange duality, to model understanding and explanation in deep learning, noting this area is currently underexploited. The research idea directly proposes using Lagrange duality to develop a new method for deep network interpretability, fitting squarely within the workshop's scope and addressing its core themes and listed topics ('Model understanding, explanation and interpretation', 'Lagrange and Fenchel dualities', 'deep learning in general')."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of current XAI methods), the core concept (framing feature importance as a constrained optimization and using Lagrange dual variables), and the proposed approach (solving the dual via back-propagation in augmented networks) are well-explained. Expected outcomes are listed. Minor ambiguities remain regarding the precise handling of non-convexity inherent in deep networks within the duality framework and the specifics of the 'augmented network architectures', but the overall research direction is clearly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While optimization and sensitivity analysis are used in XAI, the specific approach of framing feature importance via minimal perturbation optimization and then explicitly leveraging the *Lagrange dual* solution (optimal dual variables) as the primary mechanism for quantifying feature influence seems innovative. Connecting this dual solution to sensitivity certificates and proposing efficient computation via augmented networks offers a fresh perspective compared to standard gradient or perturbation methods. It directly addresses the workshop's call to explore underexploited duality concepts like Lagrange duality for explanation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Using back-propagation and augmented network architectures is standard practice in deep learning, suggesting a plausible implementation pathway. However, applying Lagrange duality rigorously to the highly non-convex optimization landscapes typical of deep networks is challenging. Strong duality often does not hold, which might complicate the interpretation of dual variables and the derivation of 'provably tight importance bounds' or 'certifiable interpretability'. Significant theoretical work would be needed to establish the validity and limitations of the dual approach in this non-convex setting. While computation seems feasible, achieving the claimed theoretical guarantees is uncertain."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Explainable AI (XAI) is a critical area for the trustworthy deployment of deep learning. Current methods often suffer from noise, computational cost, or lack of theoretical grounding. Proposing a new method based on Lagrange duality that promises theoretically sound sensitivity certificates, efficiency, and potentially improved robustness addresses a major need in the field. If successful, it could provide a powerful new tool for understanding complex models and lead to major advancements in reliable AI."
