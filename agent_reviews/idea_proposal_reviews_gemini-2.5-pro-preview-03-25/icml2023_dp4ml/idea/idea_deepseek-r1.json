        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's call to explore duality principles (specifically Lagrange duality) for modern machine learning, focusing explicitly on model understanding and explanation in deep learning. It acknowledges the challenge of non-convexity and proposes using convex relaxations, a topic explicitly listed in the call ('Convex relaxations and duality for nonconvex problems'). The focus on deriving sensitivity measures via dual variables for interpretability directly matches the example given in the task description ('Lagrange duality can be useful for model explanation because it allows us to measure sensitivity of certain perturbations, but this is not yet fully exploited')."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (limitations of existing methods, underexplored potential of duality), the core proposal (using convex relaxation to compute dual variables for sensitivity analysis in DNNs), and the expected outcomes (new metric, algorithms, robustness insights) are articulated concisely and logically. The example of identifying pixels affecting class scores under constraints aids understanding. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise choice and implementation details of convex relaxation techniques for specific 'critical layers', but the overall research direction and methodology are exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While sensitivity analysis and convex relaxation techniques exist independently, applying convex relaxation specifically to enable the computation of Lagrange dual variables for DNN *interpretability* is a novel approach. It moves beyond standard gradient-based or attribution methods by seeking a more principled sensitivity measure grounded in optimization duality, adapted for non-convex models. This directly addresses the gap identified in the task description regarding the underutilization of duality for explaining modern ML models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Formulating input-output relationships as constrained optimization problems is plausible. Convex relaxation techniques (SDP, LP-based, quadratic) have been applied to DNNs, primarily for robustness verification. Computing dual variables from the resulting convex programs is standard. However, the main challenges lie in the scalability and tightness of these relaxations. SDP relaxations can be computationally expensive for large networks, while simpler relaxations might introduce significant approximation errors (relaxation gap), potentially affecting the accuracy of the sensitivity measure. Significant computational resources and expertise in optimization would be required, but the core components exist."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Developing more principled and robust methods for DNN interpretability is a critical research area, particularly for trustworthy AI in high-stakes domains like healthcare (as mentioned). This approach, grounded in duality theory, could offer fundamentally different insights compared to existing methods, particularly regarding sensitivity to *constrained* perturbations. If successful, it could provide a valuable new tool for model analysis, contribute to understanding model robustness, and advance the application of duality principles in deep learning, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
