    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's theme and topics. It directly addresses 'Feedback loops between human and algorithmic decisions, and their long-term impacts', proposes using 'multi-agent models' for 'modeling societal outcomes', and incorporates elements relevant to 'strategic behavior' (game theory) and 'fairness'. The motivation and potential impact align perfectly with the workshop's goal of understanding interactions and mitigating negative societal outcomes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, core concept (MAS framework), methodology steps (agent design, simulation, modeling, analysis), and expected outcomes are logically presented. The use of MAS combined with game theory and network science is specified. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific implementation details of agent behaviors or the simulation environment, but the overall research direction is clearly defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While MAS and modeling human-algorithm interaction are existing research areas, the proposed combination of MAS, game theory, and network science specifically focused on *dynamic* feedback loops with evolving agents, and explicitly linking this to diverse societal outcomes (mobility, mental health, polarization), offers a fresh perspective. It aims to move beyond static or simpler models by capturing emergent and strategic behaviors over time."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Developing a complex MAS requires significant expertise in simulation, agent modeling, game theory, and network science. Defining realistic agent utility functions and behaviors (especially non-rational human aspects) is difficult. Validating such a complex simulation against real-world phenomena and obtaining necessary data can be problematic. The computational cost of running extensive simulations could also be substantial. It requires considerable effort and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the dynamics of human-algorithm feedback loops is crucial for addressing pressing societal issues like polarization, inequality, and fairness in algorithmic systems. The potential to inform the design of more responsible and equitable algorithms, and to contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of complex socio-technical systems, gives this research high importance."
