    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (workshop theme), the research idea, and the provided literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modeling interactions, feedback loops, long-term impacts, strategic behavior, and fairness. The objectives and methodology systematically build upon the research idea and explicitly incorporate concepts and citations from the literature review (e.g., dynamic SCMs, RL for fairness, equilibrium analysis, intervention modules, auditing tools, benchmarks). The problem statement, significance, and expected outcomes all resonate strongly with the workshop's call for papers and the challenges highlighted in the literature."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and logically presented. The background effectively sets the stage, the objectives are specific and well-defined, and the methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step plan for the research. Key concepts like dynamic SCMs, RL integration, and intervention modules are explained well within the context of the proposal. The language is precise and academic. Minor ambiguities inherent in any proposal (e.g., exact functional forms in models) do not detract from the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it builds upon existing work cited in the literature review (dynamic SCMs, RL for fairness, equilibrium analysis), its core novelty lies in the proposed *synthesis* of these advanced techniques into a unified dynamic causal framework specifically designed to analyze and *mitigate* harmful feedback loops with a focus on *long-term equity*. This integrated approach, combining causal modeling for mechanism understanding, RL for adaptive behavior, and equilibrium analysis for long-term prediction, applied to designing equity-focused interventions, represents a fresh and significant contribution beyond the individual cited papers."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations (Structural Causal Models, Reinforcement Learning, Equilibrium Analysis) and leverages recent, relevant literature effectively. The proposed methodology is detailed, technically coherent, and includes appropriate steps for formalization (SCMs), modeling dynamics (RL), analyzing long-term behavior, designing interventions, and conducting validation (simulations, baselines, ablation, sensitivity analysis). The reliance on simulation due to real-world data challenges is well-justified, and the plan includes using semi-synthetic data to enhance realism. The technical formulations, while conceptual, are appropriate and correctly presented for a proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges and an ambitious scope. Integrating dynamic SCMs, RL (potentially multi-agent), and equilibrium analysis is complex. Developing the simulation environment and realistic agent models requires substantial effort. While simulation avoids the primary difficulty of real-world longitudinal data collection (Key Challenge 5), ensuring the fidelity and scalability of simulations remains a challenge. Delivering all expected outcomes, including a polished toolkit and comprehensive benchmarks, within a typical project timeframe might be difficult. However, the core research plan is tractable, especially if pursued incrementally, making it generally feasible with appropriate expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the potential for algorithmic systems to create and amplify societal inequities through dynamic feedback loops. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's theme and broader concerns in Responsible AI. The research has the potential for major advancements in understanding socio-technical systems, developing practical tools for safer AI design and auditing, promoting long-term fairness beyond static metrics, and informing policy. Its interdisciplinary approach further enhances its significance."
