        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of modeling algorithm-human interactions, feedback loops, long-term impacts, strategic behavior, and fairness. The proposal meticulously follows the research idea, elaborating on the dynamic causal framework, SCMs, RL integration, equilibrium analysis, and intervention modules. It effectively incorporates and cites relevant papers from the literature review, positioning the work within the current research landscape and explicitly aiming to tackle the identified key challenges (dynamic interactions, long-term fairness, utility-equity trade-offs, empirical validation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically. The use of technical terms (SCM, RL, PPO, Demographic Parity) is appropriate for the target audience. The experimental design table aids understanding. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise mathematical formulation or justification of certain components (e.g., the robustness penalty L_robust, the exact link between the SCM functions f_X/f_Y and the RL policies) and the specifics of achieving identifiability under confounding, but the overall research plan and rationale are readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like SCMs, RL for fairness, and equilibrium analysis exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the specific integration of these elements to create a *dynamic causal framework* for modeling, analyzing (via equilibrium), and *intervening* in algorithm-human feedback loops with a focus on *long-term equity* represents a significant step forward. The proposed intervention modules combining temporal fairness and strategic stability within RL, along with the development of a dedicated toolkit and benchmarks for dynamic causal fairness, constitute clear novel contributions beyond incremental improvements."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established theoretical foundations (SCMs, RL, game theory, fairness metrics). The methodology outlines a coherent approach combining simulation and real-world data. Using SCMs for causal structure, RL (PPO) for agent learning, and equilibrium analysis for stability is appropriate. However, the proposal acknowledges key challenges like SCM identifiability under unobserved confounding (listed as a research goal). The specific formulation of the robustness penalty (L_robust) lacks detailed justification, and the practical guarantees of convergence for the proposed RL setup with interventions require further theoretical and empirical validation. Overall, the approach is well-grounded but relies on addressing non-trivial technical challenges."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing real-world datasets (Kaggle, LendingClub) and standard methodologies (ABM, SCM estimation, PPO). The development of a Python toolkit is a standard software engineering task. However, the scope is ambitious, integrating complex modeling (dynamic SCMs), computationally intensive simulations (multi-agent RL over many iterations), theoretical development (identifiability, equilibrium conditions), and empirical validation across two domains. Successfully achieving all objectives requires significant expertise and computational resources. Potential challenges include SCM estimation complexity, RL training stability/convergence, and ensuring the synthetic data meaningfully reflects real dynamics."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of AI, society, and ethics â€“ the potential for algorithmic systems to create and amplify inequities through dynamic feedback loops. By moving beyond static fairness analysis and focusing on long-term, causal effects, the research has the potential to make major contributions to the field of responsible AI. The expected outcomes (toolkit, benchmarks, policy-aware algorithms, theoretical insights) would be valuable for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers aiming to design and deploy AI systems that are both effective and equitable."
