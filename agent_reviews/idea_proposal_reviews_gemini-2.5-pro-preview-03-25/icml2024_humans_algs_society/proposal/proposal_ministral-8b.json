        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop task (feedback loops, long-term impacts, societal outcomes, fairness). The objectives, methodology (dynamic causal modeling, SCMs, RL, interventions), and expected outcomes (auditing toolkit, policy-aware training, fairness benchmarks) perfectly mirror the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal explicitly builds upon and positions itself within the context of the provided literature review, referencing concepts like dynamic modeling, RL for fairness, SCMs, intervention modules, auditing, and benchmarks mentioned in the cited papers."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, with a logical flow from introduction to impact. The objectives are distinct, and the methodology is broken down into understandable components. However, some technical details lack depth. For instance, the precise mechanism for integrating dynamic SCMs with RL could be elaborated further. The mathematical formulations provided are very general (e.g., X_t = f_t(X_{t-1}, U_t)), lacking specifics about the functional forms or assumptions. The nature of 'intervention modules' and 'policy-aware training schemes' remains somewhat abstract. While generally understandable, refining these technical aspects would improve clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several cutting-edge techniques (dynamic causal modeling, SCMs, RL, intervention modules) into a unified framework specifically targeting the *long-term* dynamics of algorithm-human feedback loops and their impact on *societal equity*. While the literature review shows recent work on individual components (e.g., causal inference for feedback loops, RL for fairness, SCMs for dynamics), the proposed integration and its explicit focus on developing practical tools (auditing, policy-aware training, benchmarks) for sustainable, equitable outcomes represent a novel and ambitious contribution. The emphasis on recursive dynamics and long-term fairness distinguishes it from approaches focusing solely on static or short-term effects."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is based on sound theoretical foundations (causal inference, RL, dynamic systems) and established methods (SCMs). The overall approach of using SCMs to model mechanisms and RL to simulate dynamics and optimize interventions is methodologically appropriate and supported by the recent literature cited. However, the technical rigor is somewhat limited by the high-level description. Key challenges in dynamic causal inference (e.g., identification with feedback loops, non-stationarity) are not explicitly addressed. The mathematical formulations are too generic to assess correctness thoroughly. While conceptually sound, the proposal would benefit from more detailed technical specifications regarding model assumptions and the integration of its components."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating dynamic SCMs and RL robustly is technically complex. Modeling realistic human behavior (including strategic adaptation) within these loops is difficult. A major hurdle, acknowledged as a key challenge in the literature review, is obtaining suitable real-world, longitudinal data to validate the models and interventions effectively; the proposal mentions collecting such data but doesn't detail the strategy. Designing intervention modules that are effective, robust, and free of negative side effects is non-trivial. While the use of synthetic data is a good starting point, the real-world validation aspect poses considerable risks to successful execution within a typical project scope."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem at the intersection of AI, ethics, and society. Understanding and mitigating the long-term societal impacts of algorithm-human feedback loops is crucial for responsible AI development and deployment. The potential contributions – tools for auditing feedback risks, methods for designing fairer algorithms considering long-term effects, and benchmarks for evaluation – could have a substantial impact on academic research, industry practice, and policymaking. The focus on equitable outcomes in dynamic environments tackles a key limitation of current approaches."
