        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed, including 'Research into adversarial attacks, security and privacy for agents' and explicitly targets 'Research into multi-agent safety and security'. The focus on coordinated attacks, collusion between agents, and emergent functionality directly matches the specific interests mentioned under the multi-agent topic. It also incorporates 'Research into environmental and societal impacts of agents'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main goals (simulation, defense development, evaluation), and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The proposed defense mechanisms (collaborative filtering, emergent functionality detection, adaptive protocols) provide a good sense of the direction. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise technical implementation details of the proposed defenses, particularly 'emergent functionality detection', but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial robustness for single agents is studied, the specific focus on coordinated attacks within multi-agent LLM systems and developing defenses tailored to this context (like collaborative filtering against collusion and detecting harmful emergent functionalities) offers a fresh perspective. It extends existing security research into the more complex and less explored domain of interacting agents, representing a significant step beyond single-agent analysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, but presents some research challenges. Simulating multi-agent attacks is achievable, though potentially resource-intensive. Developing defenses like collaborative filtering and adaptive protocols is plausible. However, reliably detecting and neutralizing potentially harmful 'emergent functionalities' in complex multi-agent systems is a known difficult problem in AI safety and may require significant innovation. Evaluation in dynamic multi-agent settings also requires careful experimental design."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. As agentic AI systems become more interconnected and autonomous, understanding and mitigating risks arising from multi-agent interactions (like collusion or harmful emergent behaviors) is critical for safety and trustworthiness. Addressing coordinated adversarial attacks is a crucial, forward-looking problem. Successful outcomes would represent a major advancement in ensuring the safe deployment of multi-agent AI systems."
