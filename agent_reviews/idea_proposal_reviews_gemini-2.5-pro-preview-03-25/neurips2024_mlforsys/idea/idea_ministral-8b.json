        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses one of the specific interests mentioned: 'Applying ML to systems issues that emerge from large-scale training and serving, such as compiler partitioning schemes for training LLMs across thousands of GPU or TPU devices.' Furthermore, by including energy consumption in the reward function, it also touches upon the interest in 'Applying ML for compute sustainability'. The use of RL aims to move beyond static heuristics, aligning with the workshop's goal of moving beyond replacing numerical heuristics with ML."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, main concept (using RL for dynamic partitioning), methodology steps (simulation, agent development, evaluation, deployment), expected outcomes, and potential impact are clearly laid out. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific state/action space definition for the RL agent and the precise details of the simulation environment, but these are acceptable for a research idea abstract. Overall, the core proposal is easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While applying RL to optimization problems is common, its specific application to dynamic, real-time compiler partitioning for large-scale distributed LLM training, considering factors like energy consumption and resource utilization dynamically, is innovative. Current methods often rely on static analysis or simpler heuristics. This approach offers a more adaptive, learning-based solution tailored to the complexities of modern large model training, representing a fresh perspective on the problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Creating a high-fidelity simulation environment that accurately models the complex interactions of thousands of devices during LLM training (including communication, computation, and potential failures) is extremely difficult. Training the RL agent itself could be computationally intensive, requiring substantial resources. Integrating and deploying such an RL agent into real-world, complex distributed training systems presents considerable engineering hurdles, including state monitoring overhead and ensuring stability. Generalization across different models and hardware configurations is also a concern."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Optimizing compiler partitioning is critical for efficiently training ever-larger LLMs, which consume vast amounts of computational resources and energy. Even modest improvements in partitioning can lead to substantial reductions in training time, cost, and carbon footprint. Addressing this bottleneck would be a major advancement for the field of large-scale machine learning and contribute significantly to sustainable computing practices. Success would have immediate practical relevance."
