    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the MLsys workshop's call for 'Applying ML for compute sustainability' and 'Using LLMs for systems challenges'. It comprehensively expands on the core research idea, detailing the LLM-driven approach, data integration, learning framework, and targeted carbon reduction goals. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging existing carbon-aware scheduling methods (PCAPS, CASPER, CarbonClipper, etc.) and explicitly positioning the LLM approach as a novel method to overcome limitations of prior heuristic or traditional ML techniques by handling complexity and diverse data sources more effectively."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, motivation, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The architecture of the LLM-CWS framework is broken down into components, and the experimental plan is detailed. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as the precise input/output format for the LLM and the exact interplay between the core LLM's predictive capabilities and the potential external prediction sub-modules. However, these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While carbon-aware scheduling is an active research area (as shown in the literature review), the core novelty lies in employing a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) as the central decision-making engine for this complex, dynamic optimization task. This contrasts with the cited works that primarily use specific algorithms, heuristics, or traditional ML models. The idea of leveraging an LLM's ability to reason over heterogeneous data (structured metrics, potentially unstructured policies/job descriptions) and continuously learn from feedback (SFT/RLEF) in the context of carbon-aware scheduling is a fresh perspective and directly aligns with the workshop's interest in novel LLM applications for systems."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established concepts in cloud computing, workload scheduling, and carbon accounting. The proposed methodology, including data integration, framework architecture (with feedback loop), and evaluation plan (simulation, baselines, metrics), is generally well-defined and technically coherent. The mathematical formulation correctly defines the optimization goal. However, the soundness relies heavily on the assumption that current LLMs, even when fine-tuned, can effectively learn the complex scheduling policies required to outperform state-of-the-art specialized algorithms or reinforcement learning agents designed specifically for scheduling. The potential need for separate prediction modules acknowledges this uncertainty. While plausible, the LLM's capability for this specific task requires empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Accessing and processing diverse real-time data streams, building a sophisticated multi-datacenter simulation environment, and effectively fine-tuning a large language model (requiring substantial data, compute resources, and expertise in techniques like SFT or RLEF) are demanding tasks. The potential inference latency of a large LLM might conflict with the real-time decision-making requirements of workload scheduling, potentially impacting performance (though the proposal plans to measure overhead). While feasible in a well-resourced research setting, the engineering complexity and the inherent risks associated with the LLM's performance for this specific optimization task lower the feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of reducing the substantial carbon footprint of cloud computing. Successfully developing an LLM-based scheduler that achieves significant carbon reductions (targeting 15-30%) while maintaining performance SLAs would have major environmental and economic benefits for cloud providers and users. Scientifically, it pushes the boundaries of ML for Systems by exploring the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in complex, dynamic resource management and optimization tasks, directly contributing to the themes of the MLsys workshop and the broader fields of sustainable computing and AI for systems."
