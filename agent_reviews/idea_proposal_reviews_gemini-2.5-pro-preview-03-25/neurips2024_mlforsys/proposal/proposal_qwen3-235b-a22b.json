        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for 'Applying ML for compute sustainability' and 'Using LLMs for systems challenges'. It elaborates significantly on the core research idea of using LLMs for carbon-aware scheduling, detailing the integration of multiple data sources and the expected benefits. Furthermore, it effectively positions itself within the context of the provided literature review, acknowledging existing works (PCAPS, CASPER, CarbonScaler, Mia et al.) and clearly differentiating its proposed LLM+RL approach based on enhanced contextual understanding and online adaptability, addressing challenges identified in the review like data integration and balancing performance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The introduction sets the stage effectively, the objectives are clearly stated (LLM+RL for carbon/SLA optimization), and the expected outcomes are quantified. The methodology section provides good detail on data sources, preprocessing, the overall architecture (LLM + RL), and the evaluation plan. Mathematical notations, while present, are standard for the domain. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor areas for refinement could include more specific details on the LLM fine-tuning strategy or the precise state/action representation within the RL framework, but these do not significantly hinder overall understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While carbon-aware scheduling and the use of ML/RL in systems are existing areas, the specific combination of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for their contextual understanding capabilities and reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy optimization in the context of real-time carbon-aware workload scheduling appears novel. It distinguishes itself from heuristic-based methods (PCAPS, CarbonScaler) and potentially simpler ML models by aiming to capture more complex interdependencies and enabling online adaptation. The proposed integration of diverse real-time data streams (carbon intensity, renewables, workload patterns) into an LLM+RL framework represents a fresh approach compared to the cited literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established foundations in LLMs, RL (PPO), and carbon-aware computing. The proposed methodology, including data integration, the dual LLM-RL architecture, and the reward function design, is logical and well-justified. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, metrics, and datasets. However, the technical formulation for the LLM encoder is presented at a high level, and the complexities of ensuring stable and effective RL training in such a dynamic, multi-objective environment are acknowledged but not fully detailed. The reliance on the quality and availability of real-time data streams also introduces potential challenges not fully mitigated in the proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but presents moderate challenges. Accessing diverse, high-quality real-time datasets (especially production workload traces) might be difficult. Fine-tuning large LLMs and training complex RL agents require significant computational resources, which are acknowledged (AWS EC2 instances). Integrating the LLM and RL components effectively and ensuring low-latency inference for real-time scheduling decisions are non-trivial engineering tasks. The mention of simulation environments (Sedna) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) suggests awareness of these challenges, and the hybrid fallback mechanism adds practicality. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable for a capable research team with adequate resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and growing problem of carbon emissions from cloud datacenters, aligning with global sustainability goals and industry needs. Achieving the projected 20-35% carbon reduction over state-of-the-art methods would represent a major advancement. The research directly contributes to the ML for Systems field, particularly in sustainable computing. The potential for online adaptation and interpretable explanations (via LLM) adds practical value for cloud providers and customers, potentially influencing operational practices and aiding regulatory compliance (e.g., CSRD). The quantified potential global impact further underscores its importance."
