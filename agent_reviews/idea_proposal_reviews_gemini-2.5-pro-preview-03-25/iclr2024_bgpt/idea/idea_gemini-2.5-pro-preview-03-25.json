        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for bridging the gap between deep learning theory and practice, and lists 'Theory of large language models' and 'theory of in-context learning' as key topics. The idea directly addresses this by proposing to connect ICL theory with practical prompt engineering heuristics, aiming to troubleshoot and narrow the gap between theoretical understanding and empirical observations in LLMs."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (gap between ICL theory and prompt sensitivity), the main approach (systematic experiments linking prompt variations, internal representations, and theory), and the expected outcome (a framework explaining prompt effectiveness) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It clearly outlines *what* will be done and *why*."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While research exists separately on ICL theory and empirical prompt engineering, the proposed systematic approach to directly link specific prompt heuristics to theoretical mechanisms via controlled analysis of internal LLM representations is innovative. It moves beyond purely empirical observation or purely theoretical modeling by attempting a mechanistic explanation grounded in both."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Conducting controlled prompt variation experiments is standard. Accessing and analyzing internal LLM representations (activations, attention) is technically possible, especially with open-source models, but can be computationally intensive and require sophisticated tools. Correlating these findings with diverse ICL theories requires significant effort. The main hurdles are computational resources and potentially limited access to the internals of state-of-the-art proprietary models, but the core methodology is sound with available resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding *why* prompt engineering works is a critical open question in the LLM field. Bridging the gap between ICL theory and practice would lead to more principled prompt design (moving beyond trial-and-error), refine our theoretical understanding of LLM capabilities, and potentially inform future model development. It addresses a core challenge highlighted by the rapid advancement and widespread use of LLMs."
