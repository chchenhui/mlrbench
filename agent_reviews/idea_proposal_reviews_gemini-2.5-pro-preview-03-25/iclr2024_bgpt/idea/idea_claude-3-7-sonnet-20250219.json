        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging the gap between deep learning theory and practice by investigating the discrepancy between classical learning theory predictions and observed generalization performance. Furthermore, it explicitly targets 'implicit bias of gradient-based optimizers', which is listed as a key subarea under both 'Optimization theory' and 'Generalization theory' in the workshop topics. The idea aims to provide a theoretical understanding of practical phenomena related to optimizer choice and generalization."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (generalization puzzle in overparameterized models). The main idea concisely explains the proposed approach: analyzing parameter trajectories using specific theoretical tools (information geometry, dynamical systems) to characterize implicit bias and link it to generalization. The expected outcome (predictive theory for optimizer selection) is also clearly stated. While the specific implementation details of applying information geometry and dynamical systems theory might require further elaboration for reproducibility, the overall concept and research plan are exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The general topic of implicit bias in deep learning optimization is an active area of research, so the problem itself is not entirely new. However, the proposed methodology – specifically using a combination of information geometry and dynamical systems theory to decompose the parameter space into 'functionally relevant subspaces' and analyze optimizer trajectories within these subspaces – offers a notably original perspective. This approach moves beyond simpler measures of bias (e.g., convergence to minimum norm solutions) and aims for a more nuanced, dynamic characterization. It represents a fresh combination and application of theoretical tools to this problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant challenges. Tracking parameter trajectories is computationally possible, although potentially resource-intensive for large models. Empirically testing predictions on various architectures/datasets is standard. However, the core theoretical components – applying information geometry and dynamical systems theory effectively to the high-dimensional, non-convex landscapes of deep neural networks – is highly non-trivial. Defining and analyzing 'functionally relevant subspaces' and interpreting trajectories within them poses considerable theoretical and computational hurdles. Success likely depends on significant theoretical insights or potentially simplifying assumptions/approximations, making implementation challenging but not necessarily impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the implicit bias of optimizers is fundamental to explaining the surprising generalization capabilities of deep learning models, a central open question in the field. Successfully characterizing this bias and developing a predictive theory for optimizer selection based on it would represent a major advancement. It could lead to more principled algorithm design, reduce reliance on empirical trial-and-error for choosing optimizers, and provide deeper theoretical foundations for deep learning practice, directly contributing to bridging the theory-practice gap."
