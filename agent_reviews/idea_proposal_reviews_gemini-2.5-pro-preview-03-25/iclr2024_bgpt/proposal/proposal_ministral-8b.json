    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core task of bridging the theory-practice gap in deep learning, focusing specifically on optimization theory topics like the Edge of Stability (EoS) and non-smoothness mentioned in the task description. The proposed DCAO method directly operationalizes the research idea by using curvature information (Hessian eigenpairs via Lanczos) to dynamically adjust hyperparameters, aiming to tackle the issues highlighted in the motivation. It explicitly references key concepts and papers (Cohen et al. 2021, 2022) discussed in the literature review and positions itself relative to related work like Hi-DLR. The methodology and expected outcomes are entirely consistent with the stated goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives (improving stability, convergence, generalization via curvature-aware optimization) are clearly stated. The methodology is broken down logically into theoretical analysis, algorithm development, and empirical validation. The algorithmic steps and mathematical formulations for Hessian approximation, curvature metrics, and hyperparameter updates are provided. The experimental plan is outlined. Minor areas for refinement include specifying the frequency of curvature probing more concretely than 'set intervals' and providing a deeper justification for the specific exponential forms chosen for the hyperparameter update rules, although the general principle is clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using Hessian information (specifically low-rank approximations via Lanczos) for optimization is not entirely new (e.g., Hi-DLR, ADLER from the literature review), DCAO's novelty lies in its specific approach: (1) utilizing *both* spectral radius and spectral gap as curvature metrics, and (2) using these metrics to dynamically adjust *multiple* hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum, and weight decay). Most related works focus primarily on adapting the learning rate based on the top eigenvalue or general curvature. This multi-metric, multi-hyperparameter adaptation strategy, explicitly linked to navigating the EoS regime, offers a fresh perspective and distinguishes it from prior work cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established theoretical concepts (Hessian analysis, eigenvalues, EoS phenomenon, Lanczos algorithm). Using curvature information to guide optimization is theoretically well-motivated. The use of stochastic Lanczos for approximating Hessian eigenpairs is a standard and rigorous technique for large models. The principle of adjusting hyperparameters based on curvature (e.g., reducing LR when curvature is high) is sound. However, the specific mathematical forms proposed for the hyperparameter update rules (exponential decay based on spectral radius/gap) appear somewhat heuristic and lack rigorous derivation within the proposal itself. While the proposal mentions deriving convergence bounds, the soundness hinges on the success and rigor of that future theoretical work. The experimental design is standard and sound for evaluating optimizers."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges, primarily concerning computational overhead. Calculating low-rank Hessian approximations periodically using stochastic Lanczos iterations adds significant computational cost compared to first-order methods like Adam or SGD, potentially slowing down training considerably. While the proposal mentions 'minimal overhead' and 'periodic probing', the actual impact depends heavily on the probing frequency, the rank 'k' of the approximation, and implementation efficiency. Integrating this into standard frameworks is possible, and required datasets are available. However, the practicality for very large models or resource-constrained settings is questionable without significant optimization. Tuning the new meta-parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, probing frequency, k) could also be complex."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant and highly relevant problem in deep learning: bridging the gap between optimization theory and practice, particularly concerning the Edge of Stability phenomenon and loss landscape geometry. Developing optimizers that are more stable, converge faster, and generalize better by leveraging theoretical insights like curvature has substantial potential impact. If successful, DCAO could offer tangible improvements over existing optimizers, especially in challenging training regimes, and contribute valuable insights into the practical implications of theoretical findings. It directly tackles core challenges outlined in the task description and literature, potentially influencing future optimizer design."
