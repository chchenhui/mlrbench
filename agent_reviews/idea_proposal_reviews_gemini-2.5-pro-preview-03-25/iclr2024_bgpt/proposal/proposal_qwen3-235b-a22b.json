    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of bridging the theory-practice gap in deep learning, focusing specifically on optimization theory topics like the Edge of Stability (EoS), adaptive optimizers, and non-smoothness, all mentioned in the task description. The proposed DCAO method is a direct elaboration of the research idea, aiming to operationalize theoretical insights about curvature (EoS, spectral properties) into a practical optimizer. The proposal effectively situates itself within the provided literature, referencing key papers on EoS (Cohen et al., Arora et al., Song & Yun) and related Hessian-aware optimizers (Hi-DLR, ADLER), clearly outlining how DCAO builds upon or differs from this prior work. It explicitly tackles challenges identified in the literature review, such as computational overhead and stability."

The experimental plan is well-articulated with specified datasets, models, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The expected outcomes are quantified, enhancing clarity. The language used is precise and technical, making the proposal readily understandable to experts in the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While leveraging existing techniques like stochastic Lanczos for Hessian spectrum estimation and building upon the concept of Hessian-aware optimization (like ADLER, Hi-DLR), DCAO introduces novel elements. Specifically, the simultaneous dynamic adaptation of multiple hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum, *and* weight decay) based on *both* the spectral radius (\\rho) and the spectral gap (\\gamma) appears novel. Using the spectral gap to modulate momentum is a distinct contribution compared to methods focusing primarily on the largest eigenvalue (spectral radius) for learning rate adaptation. It represents a fresh combination and application of existing concepts to directly address the EoS phenomenon and curvature challenges in a practical optimizer, moving beyond analysis towards intervention."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and mostly rigorous, based on established concepts like Hessian spectral analysis and stochastic approximation methods (Lanczos). The motivation connecting curvature to stability (EoS) and convergence speed (spectral gap) is well-grounded in recent theoretical literature. The proposed methodology uses standard techniques for eigenvalue estimation. However, the specific hyperparameter adaptation rules, while intuitively motivated, appear somewhat heuristic (e.g., the exact functional forms and exponents a, b). The theoretical analysis section outlines a relevant framework ((L1, L2)-smoothness) and cites recent work, promising convergence guarantees, but these are stated as goals rather than fully derived results within the proposal. The choice of the outer product approximation for the Hessian (H_t \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\sum \\\\nabla f_i \\\\nabla f_i^\\\\top) is a specific simplification that might not fully capture the Hessian's structure and could impact the rigor of the analysis compared to methods using Hessian-vector products. Overall, the foundations are solid, but some aspects require further theoretical justification and empirical validation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible. The core computational component, stochastic Lanczos, is a known technique, and the proposal cites related work (ADLER) suggesting the computational overhead (â‰¤3%) can be managed by controlling the probing frequency (T) and approximation rank (k). Integrating the proposed steps into standard deep learning frameworks is technically straightforward, as indicated by the pseudocode. The experimental plan uses standard datasets (CIFAR, C4, GLUE) and models (ResNet, Transformer), which are accessible. Potential challenges include the practical stability and accuracy of the stochastic spectral estimates and the complexity of tuning the new hyperparameters introduced by DCAO (a, b, epsilon, T, k, etc.), but these seem like manageable research risks rather than fundamental roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles fundamental challenges in deep learning optimization: stability (especially near the EoS), convergence speed, and generalization, which are critical for training large and complex models. By attempting to directly incorporate theoretical insights about loss landscape geometry (curvature, spectral properties) into a practical optimizer, it strongly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging the theory-practice gap. Success would not only yield a potentially superior optimizer but also provide valuable empirical validation for the role of curvature in optimization dynamics. The potential to influence the design of future optimizers and contribute to understanding phenomena like EoS and scaling laws gives the work substantial potential impact."
