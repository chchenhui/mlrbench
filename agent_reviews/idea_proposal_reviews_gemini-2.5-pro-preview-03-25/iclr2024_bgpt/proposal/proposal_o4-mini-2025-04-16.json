    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of bridging the theory-practice gap in deep learning optimization, focusing specifically on the Edge-of-Stability (EoS) phenomenon, curvature, and adaptive methods, all highlighted in the task description. The methodology directly implements the research idea of DCAO using stochastic Lanczos for curvature probing and dynamic hyperparameter adjustment. It explicitly references and builds upon key papers discussed in the literature review concerning EoS and Hessian-informed optimization (e.g., Cohen et al. 2021, Xu et al. 2025, Balboni & Bacciu 2023)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology is broken down logically into curvature probing, adaptive scheduling (with specific formulas), pseudocode for the training loop, theoretical analysis goals, and a detailed experimental plan. The rationale connecting EoS theory to the proposed optimizer design is clearly articulated. Minor details, like the exact tuning process for new hyperparameters or the full theoretical proofs, are understandably omitted at the proposal stage, but the core concepts and plan are exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While components like stochastic Lanczos for Hessian spectrum estimation and adaptive hyperparameters are known, their specific combination and application here are novel. Using both spectral radius and spectral gap from low-rank approximations to dynamically adjust learning rate, momentum, *and* weight decay specifically to stabilize EoS dynamics and bridge the theory-practice gap distinguishes it from prior work like Adam (first-order/diagonal), full second-order methods (cost), ADLER (PSD approximation for LR), and Hi-DLR (Hessian info for LR/freezing). The novelty lies in the integrated mechanism and its targeted application, rather than a completely groundbreaking technique."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid theoretical foundations (EoS, Hessian spectrum, optimization theory) and established methods (SGD+momentum, Lanczos). The proposed methodology (periodic probing, adaptive rules) is technically plausible and well-justified conceptually. The inclusion of planned theoretical analysis (convergence guarantees under non-smoothness, implicit regularization) adds rigor. The technical formulations provided are correct. Minor weaknesses include the heuristic nature of the specific adaptive functions (though common practice) and the brief proof sketch for the convergence claims, which are ambitious but seem approachable using standard techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core methodology relies on standard techniques (HVP, Lanczos) implementable in common frameworks. The proposal proactively addresses computational overhead, providing estimates (<5%) and parameters (m=20, T_c=100) that seem reasonable. The experimental plan uses standard benchmarks and architectures, requiring significant but standard compute resources. Potential challenges include tuning the new hyperparameters (\\alpha, \\beta_1, \\lambda_1, \\rho_{\\mathrm{ref}}, \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}}, T_c, m) and potentially achieving the ambitious theoretical guarantees, but these are research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It tackles a critical and widely recognized problem: the gap between deep learning theory (especially regarding optimization dynamics like EoS and curvature) and practical optimizer design. Successfully developing DCAO would provide a concrete example of theory informing practice, potentially leading to more stable, faster, and better-generalizing training regimes. The potential scientific impact (advancing understanding of optimization and implicit bias) and practical impact (providing a useful tool for practitioners) are substantial. It directly aligns with the goals of advancing robust, efficient, and theoretically-grounded deep learning."
