    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core issues highlighted in the workshop call, such as the overemphasis on single metrics, lack of context in benchmarking, and the need for comprehensive documentation and holistic evaluation. The proposed 'Benchmark Cards' idea is faithfully translated into a detailed plan, explicitly building upon concepts like Model Cards (Mitchell et al.) and holistic evaluation frameworks (HELM, HEM) mentioned or relevant to the literature review. It targets specific workshop topics like 'Comprehensive data documentation', 'Holistic and contextualized benchmarking', and 'Benchmark reproducibility', showing a deep understanding of the context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, the motivation is well-articulated, and the proposed 'Benchmark Card' concept is explained thoroughly, including tentative sections and examples. The methodology is broken down into logical, understandable phases with clear steps. The language is precise, and the overall structure facilitates easy comprehension. Minor details regarding implementation specifics (e.g., precise expert selection criteria) are understandably less concrete at the proposal stage but do not detract from the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by extending established documentation concepts (Model Cards, Datasheets) to a new and crucial domain: the ML benchmark itself (as a combination of dataset, task, protocol, and metrics). While inspired by prior work, the specific focus on creating a standardized card for *benchmarks* to promote holistic evaluation and contextual understanding addresses a distinct gap not fully covered by existing frameworks. The synthesis of ideas from documentation standards and holistic evaluation literature into this specific format is innovative. The novelty is clearly articulated and justified by the identified limitations in current benchmark practices."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established critiques of ML benchmarking and leverages successful prior work (Model Cards, HELM). The proposed methodology is systematic, outlining clear phases for template design, information gathering, population, and validation. The inclusion of specific examples of holistic metrics (fairness, robustness, efficiency) and even a technical formulation (DPD) demonstrates technical grounding. The plan to justify metric choices based on context and literature adds rigor. While the selection of holistic metrics can involve subjectivity, the proposal acknowledges this and plans for justification based on literature and benchmark characteristics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. The research primarily involves literature review, information synthesis, template design, and expert consultation, which are achievable with standard research resources. The phased approach is realistic, and limiting the initial scope to 3-5 benchmarks makes the population phase manageable. Using accessible formats like Markdown/JSON enhances practicality. Potential challenges like information availability and repository integration are acknowledged, with the latter framed appropriately as exploration and engagement. The optional nature of the user study further demonstrates feasibility awareness."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized problem in the ML community â€“ the limitations and potential harms of simplistic benchmarking. By promoting holistic, context-aware evaluation and enhancing transparency, Benchmark Cards have the potential to foster more responsible AI development, improve model reliability in real-world applications, and shift evaluation norms. The work directly aligns with the goals of the workshop call, aiming to improve ML data and benchmarking practices and potentially influence major data repositories. The potential contribution to FAIR principles further underscores its significance."
