    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core issues highlighted in the task description, such as the overemphasis on single metrics, lack of context in benchmarking, need for standardized documentation, and holistic evaluation. The proposal faithfully expands on the research idea of 'Benchmark Cards'. It effectively synthesizes the literature review, positioning Benchmark Cards as a necessary extension to existing concepts like Model Cards and holistic evaluation frameworks (HELM, HEM), while explicitly tackling the identified challenges."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected impact are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. The components of the Benchmark Card are clearly listed. The validation plan is detailed with specific phases, metrics, and hypotheses. Minor ambiguities exist only in the precise operationalization of the 'adversarial weight-rebalancing process' for the composite score, but the overall concept is understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building upon existing concepts like Model Cards and holistic evaluation frameworks (HELM), the core idea of creating a standardized documentation framework specifically for *benchmarks* to enforce contextual and holistic evaluation is novel. It addresses a recognized gap in the ML ecosystem documentation standards. The focus on standardizing the *communication* and *contextualization* of benchmark results, rather than just proposing new metrics, represents an innovative socio-technical approach to improving evaluation practices. The proposed composite scoring mechanism with adversarial rebalancing also adds a specific methodological novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the critique of current benchmarking practices and leverages established concepts (documentation cards, holistic evaluation). The proposed Benchmark Card structure is comprehensive. The methodology for developing the cards (literature review, interviews, Delphi method) and the multi-phase validation plan are robust. However, the technical formulation of the composite score, particularly the 'adversarial weight-rebalancing process' and the role of thresholds (Ï„i), lacks sufficient detail and rigorous justification, representing a minor gap in the methodological soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Designing the template, developing a toolkit, and piloting the creation of 5-7 Benchmark Cards are achievable within a typical research project scope. The validation plan's Phase 1 and 3 are feasible. Phase 2 (user study with 200+ researchers) and the Delphi method require significant recruitment effort but are manageable. The primary challenge lies in achieving widespread community adoption, which is inherently difficult for standardization efforts, though the proposal outlines reasonable steps (engaging repositories/conferences). The technical implementation of the core ideas is practical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged problem in ML research: the limitations and potential harms of simplistic, context-agnostic benchmarking. If successful, Benchmark Cards could foster a major shift towards more responsible, transparent, and holistic evaluation practices, improving model selection for real-world applications and mitigating risks. The potential impact on research culture, repository practices, and deployment reliability is substantial, aligning perfectly with the workshop's themes."
