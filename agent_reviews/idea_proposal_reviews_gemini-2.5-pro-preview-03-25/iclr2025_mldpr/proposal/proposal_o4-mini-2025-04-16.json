    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of improving ML data practices, holistic benchmarking, documentation, reproducibility, and the role of repositories. It systematically elaborates on the core 'Benchmark Card' idea, positioning it clearly against the cited literature (Model Cards, HELM, HEM) and explicitly targeting the identified gaps (standardized documentation *for benchmarks*, automated tooling, empirical evaluation). All components are tightly integrated and mutually supportive."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, motivation, research objectives, and methodology are articulated concisely and logically. The breakdown into phases (Template Design, Toolkit Development, Pilot, Evaluation) is easy to follow, and each phase includes sufficient detail (e.g., template fields, pseudocode, pilot datasets, evaluation study design). The expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities might exist in the exact implementation details of the NLP parser or the specific robustness metric formulation, but overall clarity is excellent."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While inspired by existing concepts like Model Cards and holistic evaluation frameworks (HELM, HEM), the core idea of creating a standardized documentation framework specifically *for benchmarks* themselves is novel. Key novel contributions include: 1) The specific Benchmark Card template design tailored to datasets/benchmarks. 2) The development of a semi-automated toolkit to assist in card generation. 3) The empirical evaluation of the impact of this documentation on user behavior (model selection, reproducibility). It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work focused on models or specific evaluation frameworks."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the recognized limitations of current benchmarking practices and builds logically on prior work. The methodology is robust, particularly the mixed-methods empirical evaluation plan which includes control/experimental groups, relevant metrics, and statistical analysis plans. The template design is comprehensive. The toolkit approach (NLP parsing, stats analysis, bias scanning, expert review) is practical. Technical formulations for metrics are mostly standard, although the composite score relies on potentially subjective weights (acknowledged) and the robustness metric could be more specific. Overall, the approach is well-justified and technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and standard research resources. The plan is realistic, broken down into manageable phases. Developing the template, toolkit (semi-automated), and running pilots on 3 benchmarks are achievable goals. The empirical study design is standard, and recruiting 30 participants is feasible. Key challenges include the robustness of NLP parsing on diverse READMEs (mitigated by semi-automation and expert review) and securing collaboration with repositories for integration, but these are identified and seem manageable within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and widely acknowledged problems in ML evaluation: the limitations of single-metric leaderboards, lack of context, hidden biases, and reproducibility issues. By promoting context-aware, multi-dimensional evaluation through a standardized framework and tools, it has the potential to foster a culture shift towards more responsible and reliable ML development. Successful adoption, especially via repository integration, could lead to major improvements in transparency, fairness, robustness, and reproducibility across the field."
