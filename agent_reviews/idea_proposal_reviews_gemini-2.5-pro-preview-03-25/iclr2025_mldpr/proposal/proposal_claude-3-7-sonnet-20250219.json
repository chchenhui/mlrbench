    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core issues highlighted in the task description, such as the overemphasis on single metrics, lack of holistic evaluation, need for better documentation, and contextual understanding in benchmarking. The research idea of 'Benchmark Cards' is precisely elaborated upon in the proposal. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature (HELM, HEM, Model Cards) and explicitly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review section."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-defined, and logically structured. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected impact are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The methodology section provides detailed steps for framework development, implementation, and validation, including specific examples of metric formalization. The structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes) is easy to follow. Minor details, such as the exact composition of the expert panel or specific metrics for every domain, are understandably left for the research execution phase but the overall plan is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While drawing inspiration from existing concepts like Model Cards and holistic evaluation frameworks (HELM), the core idea of creating a standardized, comprehensive documentation framework specifically for *benchmarks* ('Benchmark Cards') is novel. It uniquely combines documentation standards, holistic metric suites, contextual information, and limitations into a single, actionable framework aimed at changing community practice. The plan to develop open-source tooling and integrate with major repositories further enhances its innovative aspect by focusing on practical adoption."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations, referencing key literature on model documentation and holistic evaluation. The proposed methodology is robust, employing established techniques like expert reviews (Delphi method), pilot implementations, mixed-methods user studies (surveys, interviews, controlled experiments), and statistical analysis. The inclusion of mathematical formalizations for proposed metrics demonstrates technical depth. The plan acknowledges the need for domain-specific tailoring and includes validation through community feedback and empirical studies, indicating a rigorous approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. Developing a consensus-based framework, implementing detailed cards for 10 diverse benchmarks, building robust open-source tools, conducting extensive multi-stage user studies (requiring significant participant recruitment and effort), and securing partnerships for repository integration represent substantial undertakings. These require significant time, funding, and expertise across ML, HCI, and software engineering. While the plan is well-structured, achieving full implementation and widespread adoption presents moderate challenges and risks, particularly regarding community consensus and repository integration efforts."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged limitation in current ML practices â€“ the inadequacy of simplistic, single-metric benchmarking. By promoting contextual understanding and holistic evaluation through a standardized framework, Benchmark Cards have the potential to fundamentally shift how the community evaluates, compares, and selects models. This could lead to more responsible AI development, better alignment between research and real-world applications, improved transparency, and ultimately, more reliable and trustworthy ML systems. The potential impact on research culture, practice, and education is substantial."
