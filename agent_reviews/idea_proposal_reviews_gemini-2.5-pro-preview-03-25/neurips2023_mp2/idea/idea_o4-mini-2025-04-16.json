    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of applying moral psychology theories (specifically Kohlberg's stages of moral development) to AI practices (specifically AI alignment). It explicitly tackles several listed topics, including 'What can theories of developmental moral psychology teach us about making AI?', 'Methodologically, what is the best way to teach an AI system human values? What are competitors to RLHF?', and 'How can we incorporate diverse voices, views and values into AI systems?' (addressed in Phase 2)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, the three-phase main idea based on Kohlberg's stages, the proposed methods for each phase (reward-punishment, crowd-sourcing, constraint-based learning), and the expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. There is minimal ambiguity. Minor details, such as the precise nature of the 'logic-driven loss functions' in Phase 3, could be further specified, but the overall concept is immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While curriculum learning and AI alignment are existing fields, applying a structured curriculum explicitly based on established stages of human moral development (Kohlberg's theory) is innovative. It proposes a developmental pathway for AI morality, contrasting with static alignment methods like RLHF. The combination of different learning paradigms (RL, supervised/norm-based, constraint-based) tied to developmental stages offers a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Phase 1 (rule-following via RL) is standard. Phase 2 (social norms via crowd-sourcing) is feasible but requires substantial effort in curating diverse, high-quality data, likely involving complex collaboration with psychologists. Phase 3 (abstract principles via constraint-based learning/logic-driven losses) is the most challenging, as operationalizing abstract philosophical concepts like 'justice' into effective, scalable ML objectives is a difficult, open research problem. Significant resources and interdisciplinary expertise are required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of AI alignment and the limitations of current methods like RLHF (brittleness, value monolithism). If successful, it could lead to major advancements in creating more robust, nuanced, and ethically generalizable AI systems. Providing a structured, psychologically grounded framework for moral learning in AI would be a substantial contribution to AI safety and ethics, potentially fostering more transparent and pluralistic value alignment."
