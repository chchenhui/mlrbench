        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions showing how moral philosophy theories can be applied to AI, specifically mentioning topics like 'What pluralistic values are missing from current-day AI?' and 'How can we incorporate diverse voices, views and values into AI systems?'. The idea directly addresses these points by proposing a framework to incorporate multiple ethical theories (consequentialist, deontological, virtue, care ethics) into AI, aiming for pluralistic value alignment and moving beyond monolithic approaches. It fits squarely within the workshop's theme and addresses several key questions listed."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation explains the problem (monolithic values), and the main idea outlines a specific solution (multi-framework ethical architecture). It clearly states the types of ethical theories to be included, the intended functions of the system (identify conflicts, represent trade-offs, prioritize contextually), and the evaluation approach (case studies). The goal of shifting from consensus to navigating differences is explicit. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise implementation details of the reasoning process across frameworks, but the overall concept is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While AI alignment and incorporating ethics are studied fields, the specific approach of building an AI architecture that *simultaneously* represents and reasons through multiple, distinct philosophical frameworks (consequentialism, deontology, virtue, care ethics) is innovative. Current methods often focus on aggregating preferences (like RLHF) or encoding a single principle. Explicitly modeling the conflicts and trade-offs between these established ethical theories within the AI's reasoning process offers a fresh perspective compared to seeking a single 'aligned' value set. It's a novel combination and application of philosophical concepts in an AI architecture."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Formalizing diverse ethical theories (especially virtue and care ethics) computationally is complex. Designing an AI system that can genuinely reason through these different frameworks, identify subtle conflicts, represent nuanced trade-offs, and implement context-dependent prioritization is technically demanding and likely requires advancements in computational ethics and multi-objective reasoning. Evaluating this effectively through cross-cultural case studies also requires careful design and substantial resources. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation faces considerable hurdles, making it ambitious but not impossible within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of value alignment potentially reinforcing dominant or narrow moral perspectives. As AI systems become more globally deployed and influential, developing mechanisms for them to handle moral pluralism is essential for fairness, legitimacy, and trustworthiness. Successfully implementing such a framework could lead to major advancements in creating ethically robust AI systems that are sensitive to diverse values, significantly impacting the field of AI ethics and alignment."
