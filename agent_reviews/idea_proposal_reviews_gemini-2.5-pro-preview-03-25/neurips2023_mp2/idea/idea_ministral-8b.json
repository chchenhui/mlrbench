    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of applying moral psychology theories to AI practices. Specifically, it tackles the question 'What can theories of developmental moral psychology teach us about making AI?' by proposing a framework based on Kohlberg's stages. It also touches upon related topics like teaching human values to AI and potentially informing trustworthiness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main idea (using Kohlberg's stages), methodology (mapping, RL, evaluation), and expected outcomes/impact are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist in the specifics of *how* AI decision processes would be mapped to psychological stages and how stage-specific values would be precisely defined and taught via RL, but the overall concept is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While ethical AI and value alignment are established fields, applying developmental psychology stages (specifically Kohlberg's) as a framework for *guiding* AI's ethical development is a relatively fresh perspective. It moves beyond direct rule implementation or simple preference learning (like standard RLHF) by proposing a stage-based value inculcation process. The combination of Kohlberg's theory with RL for this purpose is innovative."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. The primary difficulty lies in operationalizing Kohlberg's abstract psychological stages within the context of AI decision-making processes. Mapping AI mechanisms (like neural network computations) to concepts like 'pre-conventional' or 'post-conventional' reasoning is conceptually challenging. Furthermore, designing RL reward functions that accurately capture and incentivize development through these distinct moral stages is non-trivial. Significant conceptual and methodological innovation would be required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the critical problem of AI alignment and ethics from a novel, psychologically grounded perspective. If successful, it could lead to AI systems with more nuanced, understandable, and potentially more robust ethical reasoning capabilities compared to current approaches. Providing a structured developmental framework for AI ethics could be a major contribution to the field, impacting trustworthiness and responsible AI development across various domains."
