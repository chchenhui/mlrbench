    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of applying moral psychology (specifically developmental theories like Kohlberg's) to AI ethics. It explicitly positions itself as exploring alternatives/complements to RLHF, a key topic mentioned. The proposal elaborates significantly on the core 'Developmental Scaffolding' idea, providing concrete stages and mechanisms. It effectively integrates concepts and challenges highlighted in the literature review, citing relevant works (both real and representative fictional ones provided) and addressing issues like cultural variability, scalability, and evaluation. The objectives and significance directly map onto the workshop's goals and the initial research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology and impact. The research objectives are explicitly listed and actionable. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the framework, model implementation, stage-specific curricula (including data types and learning signals with some technical formulations like loss functions), and a comprehensive evaluation plan with baselines and metrics. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for transitioning between stages or the specifics of synthetic data generation, but these do not significantly hinder understanding the core proposal. Overall, it is well-articulated and largely unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing concepts like developmental psychology (Kohlberg), curriculum learning, and LLM fine-tuning (SFT, RLHF/DPO), the core idea of using these developmental stages as an explicit, sequential *scaffolding* mechanism for training moral reasoning in LLMs is innovative. The literature review confirms that while others are exploring developmental theories or curriculum learning for AI ethics, this specific structured approach—combining stage-specific data, learning objectives (rule-following, social conformity, principle adherence), and sequential fine-tuning—appears distinct from prior work focusing on monolithic training or general theoretical integration. It's a novel synthesis and application rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established theories (Kohlberg's stages, curriculum learning) and standard ML techniques (LLMs, sequential fine-tuning, SFT, RL, DPO, Constitutional AI principles). The methodology is detailed, outlining specific stages, data sources, learning signals, and a robust experimental design with appropriate baselines and mixed-methods evaluation (quantitative and qualitative). Technical details like loss functions are included where appropriate. Potential challenges (cultural variability, evaluation complexity) are acknowledged. While the computational modeling might simplify complex psychological theories, and ensuring true stage-specific reasoning (not just pattern matching) is inherently difficult, the overall approach is methodologically robust and well-justified based on current practices."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. It leverages standard open-source LLMs and established fine-tuning techniques (including PEFT for efficiency). Required datasets exist (ETHICS, Moral Stories) or can be generated synthetically. The primary challenges lie in the significant effort required for curating/generating stage-specific data and conducting thorough human evaluations, as well as the computational resources needed for sequential fine-tuning. However, these are common challenges in applied LLM research. The plan is realistic, acknowledges potential bottlenecks (scalability), and outlines manageable steps. No fundamentally new or unavailable technology is required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and challenging problem of AI alignment and ethical reasoning, directly tackling limitations of current methods like RLHF. By proposing a psychologically-grounded approach, it has the potential to lead to AI systems with more nuanced, robust, and potentially trustworthy moral capabilities. Success would represent a major advancement in AI ethics methodology. Furthermore, it contributes to the computational modeling of human moral development, fostering interdisciplinary connections as encouraged by the workshop task description. The potential for creating more adaptable and context-aware AI addresses key safety concerns for real-world deployment."
