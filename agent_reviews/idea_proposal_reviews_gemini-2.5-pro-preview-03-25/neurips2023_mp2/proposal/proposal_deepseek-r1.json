    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call to apply developmental moral psychology to AI, explores alternatives to RLHF, and considers cultural pluralism and trustworthiness. The methodology is a direct operationalization of the research idea (staged learning based on developmental psychology). It effectively integrates concepts and challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as using IRL for cultural norms, the existence of prior developmental models, and the need for robust evaluation."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, multi-stage methodology, data sources, algorithmic framework (including specific RL types and reward function sketches), and experimental design are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The rationale connecting developmental psychology to AI alignment limitations is well-explained. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise implementation details of some reward components (e.g., 'Consistency(a, Phi)', 'Agreement(a, D_dilemmas)') and the 'debate-driven RL' mechanism, but these do not significantly obscure the overall approach."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the core idea of applying developmental psychology stages to AI moral learning is present in the provided literature review (e.g., papers by Endo, Doe, Johnson, Davis, Lee, White), this proposal offers a novel synthesis and a specific, structured framework. It uniquely combines different ML techniques (supervised learning, IRL, debate-driven RL) tailored to distinct developmental stages and proposes a concrete progression mechanism (progressive networks) and evaluation plan. The novelty lies more in the specific integrated architecture and experimental design rather than a completely groundbreaking conceptual leap."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established theories (developmental psychology) and AI methods (curriculum learning, RL, IRL). The proposed methodology, including stage-specific algorithms and reward functions, is logical. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, datasets, and metrics. However, the computational operationalization of psychological stages is inherently challenging and relies on interpretations. Some technical formulations (reward functions) could be more precise, and the effectiveness of specific components like 'debate-driven RL' for abstract principles requires empirical validation. The reliance on synthetic data for Stage 3 also introduces potential soundness risks if not carefully managed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable challenges. Data collection involves existing and synthetic sources, which is achievable but potentially resource-intensive. The algorithmic components use known ML techniques, although integrating them into a multi-stage curriculum with progressive networks requires significant engineering effort and computational resources. Evaluation is complex, needing expert annotations and human studies. Key risks include the difficulty of accurately modeling psychological stages, ensuring smooth transitions, generating high-quality synthetic data, and the overall complexity of training and evaluation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in current AI value alignment approaches (static nature, lack of adaptability, cultural insensitivity, transparency issues). By proposing a psychologically grounded, developmental framework, it has the potential to lead to major advancements in creating more robust, nuanced, trustworthy, and culturally adaptable AI systems. Success would have substantial implications for AI ethics research, policy development, and societal acceptance of AI, directly aligning with the core concerns of the task description."
