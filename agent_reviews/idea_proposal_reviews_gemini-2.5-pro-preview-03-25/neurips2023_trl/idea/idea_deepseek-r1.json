        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description for the Table Representation Learning Workshop. It directly addresses multiple core topics, including 'Representation Learning for (semi-)Structured Data' (proposing a new model architecture and pre-training technique), 'Generative Models and LLMs for Structured Data' (enhancing LLMs for tables), 'Multimodal Learning' (implicitly, by connecting text/SQL queries with table structure/content), and 'Applications of TRL models' (specifically targeting text-to-SQL and table QA). It aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal to advance NLP for structured data."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, the core concept of a dual-stream architecture (content vs. structure), and the intended pretraining objectives (masked cell recovery, schema relation prediction, cross-stream alignment) are well-explained. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details of the 'learnable schema graphs' and the precise mechanism for 'cross-stream alignment', but the overall research direction is understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While pretraining language models on tabular data exists, the proposed dual-stream architecture explicitly separating content and structural encoding via dedicated streams is innovative. Using 'learnable schema graphs' for the structure stream and incorporating specific pretraining tasks like 'schema relation prediction' and 'cross-stream alignment' represents a fresh approach compared to methods that primarily encode structure implicitly through positional embeddings or attention biases within a single stream."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. It leverages established components like Transformers and potentially Graph Neural Networks (for schema graphs). Pretraining such a model requires significant computational resources and large datasets, which is standard for LLM research. While the implementation of the dual-stream interaction and the schema graph representation requires careful engineering, it does not rely on unproven technologies. Extracting consistent structural metadata across diverse tables might pose practical challenges but is generally solvable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Improving the ability of LLMs to understand and reason over complex table structures addresses a critical bottleneck in applying these models to real-world structured data tasks. Success could lead to major advancements in areas like text-to-SQL generation, complex table question answering, data integration, and automated data analysis, directly impacting the NLP, ML, and DB communities. Robustness across diverse schemas, as targeted, would be a major contribution."
