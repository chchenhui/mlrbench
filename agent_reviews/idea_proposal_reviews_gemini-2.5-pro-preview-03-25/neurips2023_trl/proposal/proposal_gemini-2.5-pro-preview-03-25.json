    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the TRL workshop's goals by motivating tables as a primary modality, proposing advancements in representation learning (dual-stream architecture, pretraining tasks), focusing on NLP applications (Text-to-SQL, QA), tackling challenges with complex structures and LLMs, and aiming to bridge NLP/ML/DB communities. It faithfully elaborates on the core research idea of a dual-stream model for content and explicit structure. Furthermore, it effectively situates the proposed work within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging prior models (TAPAS, TaBERT, TableFormer, etc.) and explicitly addressing the identified research gap concerning the integration of rich structural semantics during pretraining."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and research gap to the proposed idea, objectives, methodology, and expected impact. Key concepts like the dual-stream architecture, content/structure streams, schema graph representation using GNNs, and the specific pretraining tasks (MCR, SRP, CSA) are explained clearly. The methodology section provides substantial detail on data, model architecture, pretraining objectives (including loss formulations), fine-tuning procedures, and a comprehensive evaluation plan. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). While implementation specifics like exact GNN layers or hyperparameter tuning strategies are left open (as expected in a proposal), the overall research plan is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation within the TRL field. While building upon existing Transformer and GNN techniques, the core idea of a dual-stream architecture explicitly separating and concurrently processing table content and rich structural metadata (headers, types, relational constraints via GNNs on schema) is a significant departure from prior works like TAPAS or TaBERT (linearization, implicit structure) and TableFormer (structural bias via attention). The specific combination of pretraining tasks, particularly Schema Relation Prediction (SRP) and Cross-Stream Alignment (CSA) using contrastive learning between structure and content representations, is tailored to this architecture and appears novel. It directly addresses the challenge of integrating explicit structural semantics, identified as a key gap in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established deep learning principles (Transformers, GNNs, self-supervised learning). The motivation for the dual-stream approach is clearly articulated and justified by the limitations of existing methods discussed in the literature review. The proposed methodology is robust, featuring a plausible architecture (dual-stream with cross-attention, GNN for schema), well-chosen pretraining tasks targeting different aspects of table understanding (content, structure, alignment), and a comprehensive evaluation plan with standard benchmarks, strong baselines, relevant metrics, and thorough ablation/robustness studies. Technical formulations, like the contrastive loss for CSA, are presented clearly and appear correct. A potential minor weakness lies in the assumption that rich structural metadata (especially PK/FK) can be consistently extracted or inferred at scale, which might require sophisticated heuristics or dedicated models, but the proposal acknowledges this."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The required technologies (PyTorch, Transformers, GNN libraries) and standard datasets (Spider, WTQ, WebTables) are available. The main hurdles are: 1) Reliable extraction/inference of rich structural metadata (PK/FK constraints, multi-level headers, accurate types) from diverse and potentially messy real-world tables at scale – this is crucial for the structure stream's effectiveness and might be more complex than anticipated. 2) Significant computational resources required for pretraining the dual-stream model, which is acknowledged. The scope is ambitious but manageable for a dedicated research project. Assuming access to necessary compute and expertise in NLP/GNNs/data processing, the project is feasible, though the metadata extraction step carries moderate risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical and well-recognized limitation of current table representation models and LLMs – the inadequate handling of complex table structures. Success in explicitly modeling and integrating structural semantics could lead to major advancements in TRL. This would directly translate to improved performance on high-impact applications like Text-to-SQL for natural language database querying and complex Table QA, aligning perfectly with the TRL workshop's focus on impactful applications and NLP progress. Furthermore, the research could offer valuable insights for improving LLM interactions with structured data more broadly and contribute a valuable open-source model and codebase to the community."
