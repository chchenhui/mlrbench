    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the TRL workshop's goals by motivating structured data as a primary modality and aiming to advance representation learning for tables. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core research idea of a dual-stream model separating content and structure. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself relative to the cited literature (TaBERT, TAPAS, TableFormer, etc.) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the review, such as handling complex structures and heterogeneous schemas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the dual-stream architecture, data processing, pretraining objectives (including mathematical formulations for losses and model components like embeddings and attention), and training setup. The experimental design is thorough, outlining baselines, datasets, tasks, metrics, and ablation studies. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While dual-stream architectures and graph networks are not new in themselves, their specific application here—explicitly separating table content and schema structure using dedicated transformer and graph transformer streams with cross-interaction—is innovative in the context of tabular representation learning. Compared to prior work like TableFormer (implicit structure via attention) or TaBERT/TAPAS (focus on text/table joint understanding), SADS proposes a more explicit and potentially powerful way to model table topology. The combination of pretraining objectives, particularly the schema relation prediction and the cross-stream alignment task using external queries/SQL, adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations (Transformers, Graph Transformers, standard pretraining objectives like masked language modeling). The choice of architecture (separate streams for content and structure) is well-motivated by the limitations of existing models. The proposed pretraining objectives directly target the goals of learning content, structure, and their alignment. The mathematical formulations provided for embeddings, attention mechanisms, and loss functions appear correct. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and includes relevant baselines, tasks, metrics, and ablations. Minor areas like the specifics of schema graph construction beyond PK/FK/headers could be slightly more detailed, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant computational demands. Accessing and preprocessing the proposed datasets (WikiTables, Spider, VizNet, TabFact) is achievable. Implementing the dual-stream model using standard deep learning libraries is feasible for experienced researchers. However, the specified pretraining requirement (128 A100 GPUs for ~1 week) indicates a very high computational cost, potentially limiting feasibility to well-resourced institutions. Tuning the interaction layers and balancing the three loss components might also require considerable effort. While ambitious, the plan is technically achievable given sufficient resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: improving the understanding of complex and heterogeneous tabular data, which is crucial for numerous real-world applications (data analysis, BI, semantic parsing). By explicitly modeling table structure, SADS has the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in table representation learning, leading to improved performance on critical downstream tasks like text-to-SQL and table QA. Success would provide a valuable new tool for the community (especially if models/code are released) and offer important insights into structure-aware representation learning, aligning well with the TRL workshop's goals."
