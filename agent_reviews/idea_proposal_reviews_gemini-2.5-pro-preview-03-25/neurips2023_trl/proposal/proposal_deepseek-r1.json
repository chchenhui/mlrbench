    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on representation learning for tables, LLMs for structured data, handling complex structures/heterogeneous schemas, and applications like text-to-SQL and QA. The dual-stream approach precisely matches the research idea's core concept. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself relative to the cited literature (TAPAS, TaBERT, TableFormer, XTab), aiming to overcome their limitations in structural encoding, which is identified as a key challenge."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the dual-stream architecture, tokenization, embedding strategies (including formulas), pretraining tasks (with loss function), fine-tuning approach, and a comprehensive experimental design. The structure is logical, flowing from motivation to methods and expected impact. Minor details about graph construction or cross-attention specifics could be added, but the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using Transformers and GATs for tabular data isn't entirely new, the specific architecture combining two distinct streams (content and explicit structure via GAT on a schema graph) with dedicated cross-stream alignment pretraining tasks (contrastive loss, schema relation prediction) represents a novel approach. It moves beyond implicit structure encoding (TAPAS, TaBERT) or attention biases (TableFormer) by dedicating a separate processing pathway and explicit modeling mechanism (GAT) for structural semantics, clearly distinguishing it from prior work cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established techniques like Transformers, GATs, masked language modeling, and contrastive learning. The rationale for the dual-stream approach is well-argued based on the limitations of existing models identified in the literature review. The proposed methodology, including the architecture, pretraining tasks, and evaluation plan (standard datasets, strong baselines, relevant metrics), is robust and technically well-founded. Technical formulations provided (embeddings, loss function) are correct and clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but requires significant resources. The reliance on large-scale pretraining (1M tables, WikiSQL-7M, proprietary data) and substantial compute (8x A100 GPUs) makes it resource-intensive. Access to proprietary enterprise schemas might also pose a challenge. However, the underlying technologies (Transformers, GATs) are mature, and the implementation steps are conceptually clear. Assuming access to the necessary data and compute, the research plan is realistic and achievable for a well-equipped research team."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and well-recognized limitation of current models in handling complex table structures and schemas, which hinders real-world applicability in areas like enterprise data analysis and database interaction. Successfully improving robustness and generalization on tasks like text-to-SQL and table QA, especially on complex schemas (as targeted with Spider), would represent a major advancement in the field. The potential impact on democratizing data access and enabling more sophisticated data preparation tools is substantial."
