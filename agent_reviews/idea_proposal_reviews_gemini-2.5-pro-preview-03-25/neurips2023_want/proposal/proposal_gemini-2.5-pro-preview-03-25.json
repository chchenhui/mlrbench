    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (WANT workshop goals: efficiency, scalability, resource optimization, data loading), the research idea (dynamic, resource-aware preprocessing using RL), and the literature review (addressing challenges like resource imbalance, dynamic adaptation, prefetching). It directly tackles the core themes of the workshop and elaborates comprehensively on the initial idea. It explicitly mentions how it addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review section. The only minor point preventing a perfect score is that the provided literature review focuses heavily on general RL adaptation techniques rather than specifically on prior work in data loading systems, although the proposal itself shows awareness of relevant baselines like DALI."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and easy to follow. The background, problem statement, proposed solution (DRAPPS), and research objectives are explicitly and unambiguously defined. The methodology section clearly outlines the system architecture, the RL formulation (MDP state, action, reward), data collection, integration plans, and a detailed experimental design. The language is precise and technical concepts are well-explained. Minor details regarding the exact state/action space representation or the simulation environment are understandably left for the implementation phase but do not detract from the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While optimizing data pipelines and using RL for system control are existing areas, the specific application of RL for fine-grained, dynamic scheduling of *multiple* data preprocessing aspects (task allocation CPU/GPU, adaptive compression, prioritized prefetching) based on real-time multi-resource telemetry (CPU, GPU, I/O, network) appears innovative. It moves beyond static configurations (standard DataLoaders, DALI pipelines) or simple heuristics. The novelty lies in the holistic, adaptive, learning-based control strategy for the data pipeline, clearly distinguishing it from prior work mentioned (standard loaders, DALI)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on the well-understood problem of data bottlenecks and leverages established methods (RL, specifically PPO/SAC, system monitoring). The proposed MDP formulation is logical, and the system architecture is well-conceived. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse workloads, ablation studies, and appropriate metrics. Potential challenges like RL training complexity, state/action space design, reward shaping, and system overhead are implicitly acknowledged through the planned training strategy (simulation, offline, online). The technical foundations are solid, though the success hinges on effective RL agent training and low-overhead implementation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, but it is ambitious. Implementing the core monitoring, dispatching, and basic scheduling is practical. Training an RL agent using standard libraries is feasible. However, achieving robust and high-performing RL control for this complex, dynamic system presents a significant challenge. Integrating adaptive compression (especially learned codecs) adds complexity. Ensuring seamless and low-overhead integration with both PyTorch and TensorFlow is non-trivial. Developing a polished, user-friendly open-source library requires substantial engineering effort beyond core research. The plan is realistic, but the scope implies moderate risks related to implementation complexity and achieving the targeted performance gains across diverse scenarios."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and increasingly relevant bottleneck (data preprocessing) in large-scale neural network training, which directly impacts training time, cost, energy consumption, and accessibility. Successfully developing DRAPPS could lead to substantial improvements in training efficiency, benefiting a wide range of researchers and practitioners across AI, HPC, and scientific domains. The potential to democratize access to large model training by reducing resource requirements is a major strength. The planned open-source library further enhances its potential impact on the community, aligning perfectly with the WANT workshop's goals."
