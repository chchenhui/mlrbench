    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (WANT workshop themes: efficiency, scalability, resource optimization, scheduling, efficient data loading/preprocessing, heterogeneous resources, democratizing access), the research idea (dynamic resource-aware preprocessing using RL, compression, prefetching), and the literature review (addressing identified challenges like resource imbalance, dynamic adaptation, compression, prefetching, integration). It directly tackles the core problems highlighted in the task description and elaborates comprehensively on the initial research idea. It proposes solutions for the key challenges identified in the literature review section."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (components, MDP formulation, algorithms), experimental design, and expected outcomes are well-defined and logically structured. The use of mathematical formulations for the reward function, PPO objective, VAE loss, and prefetching priority adds precision. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as more concrete examples of the state/action space elements in the MDP or details on the telemetry data acquisition frequency and overhead, but overall the proposal is easily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. The core novelty lies in applying reinforcement learning specifically to dynamically schedule fine-grained data preprocessing tasks (decompression, augmentation, tokenization) across heterogeneous resources (CPU/GPU) based on real-time system telemetry. While RL for scheduling exists, its application in this specific context of adaptive data pipeline optimization within training loops appears novel. Combining this with adaptive learned compression and model-aware prioritized prefetching further enhances the innovation. It distinguishes itself clearly from static or heuristic-based approaches in existing libraries (PyTorch DataLoader, TF DataService, DALI)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on established concepts like MDPs for scheduling, PPO for RL, and VAEs for learned compression. The methodology is generally well-defined, and the mathematical formulations presented are appropriate. However, the soundness relies on the successful integration and performance of several complex components. The effectiveness of the specific reward function needs empirical validation. The feasibility and potential overhead of real-time telemetry and RL decision-making within the tight loop of data loading need careful consideration. The gradient-based prefetching idea is plausible but less established than other components and requires justification regarding its practical benefits versus complexity."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires expertise across RL, deep learning frameworks, systems programming, and potentially hardware monitoring. Implementing the real-time telemetry, the RL agent, the adaptive compression module, and integrating them seamlessly and efficiently into existing frameworks (PyTorch/TF) is complex. Training the RL agent effectively (requiring simulation or extensive online tuning) and managing the system's overhead are non-trivial. While achievable for a skilled research team, it requires considerable engineering effort and carries implementation risks regarding performance and robustness across diverse environments."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck (data loading/preprocessing) that hinders the scalability and efficiency of large-scale neural network training. Success would lead to faster training, better resource utilization, reduced energy consumption, and potentially democratize access to large model training for resource-constrained teams. The development of open-source tools and benchmarks would be a valuable contribution. The potential to accelerate AI for science applications further underscores its importance, aligning perfectly with the WANT workshop's goals."
