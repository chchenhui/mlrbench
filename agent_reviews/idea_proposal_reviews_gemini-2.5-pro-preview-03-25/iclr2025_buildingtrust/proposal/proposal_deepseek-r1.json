    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (Workshop on Trust in LLMs, specifically addressing error detection/correction and reliability/truthfulness), the research idea (self-correcting LLMs via confidence scoring and retrieval), and the literature review (acknowledging and building upon works like SuperCorrect, ISC, STaSC, and addressing highlighted challenges like error detection accuracy and computational overhead). It directly tackles the core themes of the workshop and the specific problem outlined in the idea, using the literature to position its contribution effectively."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section logically breaks down the framework into components (Confidence Scorer, Retrieval Corrector) and outlines the algorithmic steps with mathematical formulations. The experimental design is detailed, including baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the core concepts and plan."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining intrinsic confidence estimation (using both token entropy and self-attention variance) with retrieval-augmented correction in an iterative framework. While components like retrieval augmentation and uncertainty quantification exist, their specific integration here, particularly the use of self-attention variance as a signal for triggering retrieval-based correction, offers a fresh perspective compared to the cited literature (e.g., teacher-student models like SuperCorrect or fine-tuning approaches like ISC/STaSC). The novelty lies more in the specific combination and mechanism than in groundbreaking individual components."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on established concepts like uncertainty quantification (entropy), attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented generation. The methodology is logical, and the mathematical formulations for confidence scoring and retrieval are correctly presented. The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The primary assumption needing strong empirical validation is the effectiveness of self-attention variance as a reliable proxy for low confidence/errors across different contexts and models, but the overall approach is well-grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current LLMs, datasets, knowledge bases, and retrieval techniques. The required resources and technical expertise are standard in ML research. However, achieving the ambitious target of 30-50% hallucination reduction while keeping latency increase below 20% per iteration presents a significant challenge. Tuning the confidence score parameters (\\alpha, \\beta, \\theta) and ensuring the stability of the iterative correction process might require considerable effort and experimentation. The overall plan is realistic, but the performance goals introduce moderate implementation risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of trustworthiness and prevalence of hallucinations in LLMs, which is a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law. Developing automated, efficient error detection and correction mechanisms, as proposed, would be a major advancement. Success would enhance LLM reliability, reduce reliance on costly human verification, and foster user trust, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals and having substantial practical and societal impact."
