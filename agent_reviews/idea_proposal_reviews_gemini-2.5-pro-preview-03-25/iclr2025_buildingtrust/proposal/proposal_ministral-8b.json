    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop on LLM trust, reliability, error detection/correction), the research idea (self-correcting LLM via confidence scoring and retrieval), and the literature review (builds on existing self-correction work while acknowledging challenges). It directly addresses the workshop's scope (points 2 and 8) and elaborates comprehensively on the core research idea. It also implicitly or explicitly aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature, such as computational overhead and generalization."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, and the methodology follows a logical flow, explaining the core components (confidence scorer, retrieval corrector) and the iterative process. The experimental design is outlined with relevant metrics and datasets. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise technical implementation details (e.g., exact mechanism for using self-attention for confidence, specifics of the correction scoring function), but the overall concept and approach are easily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While self-correction and retrieval augmentation are known concepts (as shown in the literature review), the specific proposed architecture combining an *internal* confidence scorer based on model internals (attention, uncertainty) with a *retrieval-augmented* corrector in an iterative loop presents a fresh perspective. It differs from the cited works focusing on teacher models, fine-tuning strategies, or specific tasks like parsing. The novelty lies in this specific synthesis for general trustworthiness enhancement."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, based on established concepts like uncertainty quantification, attention mechanisms, and retrieval augmentation. The overall methodological flow is logical. However, it lacks technical depth and rigor in key areas. The description of the confidence scorer (how attention patterns map to confidence) and the retrieval corrector (scoring function F(c) + L(c)) are high-level and lack precise formulation. Assumptions about 'verified knowledge bases' are made without detailing their scope or acquisition. The mathematical formulations provided are illustrative rather than technically complete."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with standard LLM research resources and expertise. Implementing the components involves known techniques, although integrating them into an efficient iterative system presents engineering challenges. Access to LLMs, compute resources, and benchmark datasets (TruthfulQA, FEVER) is standard. Potential bottlenecks include managing computational overhead (acknowledged as an objective), ensuring the quality and coverage of the required 'verified knowledge bases', and the ambitious target for error reduction (30-50%). The risks are manageable within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs by reducing factual errors and hallucinations. This is critical for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains, as highlighted in the task description. A successful outcome, particularly achieving substantial error reduction, would have a major impact on the field and practical applications, fostering greater user trust and enabling safer AI systems."
