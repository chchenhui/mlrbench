    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (workshop on LLM trustworthiness, focusing on reliability, truthfulness, error detection/correction), the research idea (self-correction using internal confidence and retrieval), and the literature review (addressing identified challenges like detection accuracy, overhead, and external dependencies). It directly targets scope points 2 and 8 of the workshop call. The methodology clearly elaborates on the research idea, and the proposal explicitly positions itself against the cited literature, aiming to overcome their limitations."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical (Intro, Methods, Outcomes), objectives are explicit, and the methodology (framework, detection, correction) is detailed with formulations and a flow description. The experimental design is comprehensive and easy to understand. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise method for weighting attention heads (w_{l,h}), the specifics of 'adversarial hallucination injection' for training data, and the full details of threshold calibration (\\tau_c), but these do not obscure the main thrust of the proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While self-correction and retrieval augmentation are known concepts, the specific approach of using self-attention entropy as an *internal* signal to trigger *retrieval-augmented* correction within an iterative inference loop appears novel compared to the cited works. It distinguishes itself by aiming for reduced reliance on external teacher models (unlike SuperCorrect), avoiding curated self-correction datasets (unlike ISC), targeting factual errors beyond syntax (unlike Parsing-focused), and employing a different mechanism than iterative fine-tuning (unlike STaSC)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous. It builds on plausible concepts (attention entropy for uncertainty, retrieval for fact-checking) and established methods (BM25, DPR, standard benchmarks). The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablations. However, the core hypothesis linking high attention entropy specifically to factual incorrectness needs strong empirical validation, as entropy might correlate with other factors. Additionally, some technical details, like the generation of synthetic training data and the robustness of query generation from error spans, are underspecified, slightly weakening the overall soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible given appropriate resources (LLMs, compute like DGX A100, KBs, retrieval tools), which are acknowledged. The technical components involve integrating known techniques, which is achievable but requires significant engineering effort and careful tuning (e.g., threshold calibration, iterative loop control). Key risks include the potential failure of the core hypothesis regarding attention entropy and achieving the ambitious performance/latency targets (e.g., 40% hallucination reduction with <=2x latency). The scope is demanding but manageable within a well-resourced research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs, particularly their tendency to hallucinate. This is critical for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains and aligns perfectly with the workshop's theme. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially leading to more reliable AI systems, reducing the need for costly human verification, and fostering user trust. The targeted improvements (e.g., 40% hallucination reduction) and the potential for an open-source toolkit further underscore its high impact potential."
