    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of LLM trustworthiness, reliability, truthfulness, and error detection/correction. The methodology systematically builds upon the research idea, proposing concrete steps for the internal confidence scorer and retrieval-augmented corrector. It explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as error detection accuracy (via the confidence scorer), computational overhead (as an evaluation metric), and reliance on external resources (by incorporating a knowledge base strategically). The objectives and significance sections clearly link the proposed work back to the workshop's goal of bridging research and practice in trustworthy AI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly through the project scope). The ISC-RAR framework is explained with clear algorithmic steps, including mathematical notation where appropriate. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and easy to understand. Minor technical details, such as the precise implementation of attention-based scoring or span replacement, could be further elaborated, but the current level of detail is excellent for a proposal and leaves no significant ambiguity about the core concepts and plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While components like self-correction, retrieval-augmented generation, and uncertainty quantification exist, the proposed ISC-RAR framework integrates them in a novel way. Specifically, the combination of an *internal* multi-signal confidence scorer (including token probabilities and attention patterns) to *iteratively trigger* retrieval-augmented correction for *general text generation* distinguishes it from prior work cited (e.g., STaSC avoids external tools, standard RAG isn't iterative based on self-critique, ISC/SuperCorrect use different mechanisms/focus). The novelty lies in the specific architecture and the closed-loop process driven by internal confidence assessment coupled with external knowledge grounding."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations in LLMs, uncertainty estimation, and retrieval augmentation. The proposed methodology (ISC-RAR framework) is logically constructed and technically well-grounded. The plan to use multiple signals for confidence scoring, including established metrics (NLL, probability variance) and exploring newer ones (attention patterns), is robust. The inclusion of calibration is a sign of methodological rigor. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, standard benchmarks, multiple metric types (accuracy, efficiency, error detection), qualitative analysis, and ablation studies, ensuring a thorough assessment of the framework's performance and limitations. Technical formulations are clear and correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and standard ML research resources. It requires access to pre-trained LLMs, a knowledge base (like Wikipedia), and computational resources for experiments, which are typical for LLM research. The core techniques (retrieval, uncertainty calculation) are well-established. Integrating these components into the proposed iterative framework is primarily an engineering challenge, achievable with appropriate expertise. The proposal realistically acknowledges potential challenges like computational overhead and the effectiveness of the confidence scorer, incorporating their evaluation into the plan. The optional fine-tuning step provides flexibility. While ambitious, the project appears practical and implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of LLM trustworthiness, directly targeting factual errors and hallucinations, which are major barriers to reliable deployment. Enhancing reliability through automated, intrinsic self-correction offers substantial advantages over manual verification or simple filtering, potentially enabling safer use of LLMs in high-stakes domains. Success would represent a significant advancement towards more robust, self-aware AI systems. The research aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals and has the potential to make substantial contributions to both the research community and practical applications of LLMs."
