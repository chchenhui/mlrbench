    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop task description. The workshop focuses on 'Building Trust in Language Models and Applications', and explicitly lists 'Explainability and interpretability of language model responses' as a key scope item. The proposed 'Trust Calibration Framework' directly addresses this by aiming to help users appropriately calibrate their trust in LLM outputs through context-aware explanations, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals of improving trustworthiness and enabling responsible human-LLM collaboration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation clearly defines the problem of uncalibrated trust. The main idea outlines the proposed solution: a framework integrating multiple explainability techniques, uncertainty estimates, task criticality, and a feedback loop to provide dynamic, context-aware trust signals. The core concept of adjusting explanation depth based on risk/confidence is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanisms for integrating techniques, quantifying confidence/criticality, and implementing the feedback loop, but the overall proposal is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While explainability techniques and uncertainty estimation for LLMs are existing research areas, the core concept of dynamically integrating and adjusting these elements based explicitly on model confidence and task criticality *specifically for the purpose of calibrating user trust* is innovative. It shifts the focus from merely explaining *how* a decision was made to guiding the user on *whether* to trust it in a given context. The combination of multiple explanation types, uncertainty, context-awareness, and a feedback loop for trust calibration represents a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating multiple complex explainability methods (attribution, counterfactuals, reasoning traces) is non-trivial. Reliably estimating uncertainty for generative LLM outputs is an active and difficult research problem. Defining and operationalizing 'task criticality' dynamically adds complexity. Implementing the feedback loop and evaluating the framework's effectiveness in actually calibrating user trust would require careful experimental design and user studies. While the individual components exist in research, their seamless integration and effective calibration pose considerable technical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Miscalibrated trust (over-reliance or excessive skepticism) is a major barrier to the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in critical domains. Providing users with tools to appropriately trust LLM outputs addresses a crucial real-world problem. Success in this area could lead to major advancements in human-AI collaboration, enabling more responsible adoption of LLMs in high-stakes scenarios and directly contributing to the central theme of the workshop."
