        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop task description. The workshop explicitly focuses on 'Building Trust in Language Models' and lists 'Improving reliability and truthfulness of LLMs' and 'Error detection and correction' as key scope areas. The proposed idea directly addresses these points by developing an automated framework for error detection and correction specifically to enhance LLM trustworthiness and reliability."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (LLM errors erode trust), the problem (inefficiency of human verification), the proposed solution (internal confidence scorer + retrieval-augmented corrector in an iterative loop), the evaluation methodology (benchmarks like TruthfulQA/FEVER, overhead analysis), and the expected outcomes (reduced hallucinations, enhanced trust). The components and process are explained concisely, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While concepts like retrieval augmentation (RAG), uncertainty quantification, and self-correction exist individually, the proposed integration of an *internal* confidence scorer (using signals like attention patterns) with a retrieval-augmented *iterative* correction loop within the generation process offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond simple post-hoc correction or standard RAG by aiming for a more dynamic, self-aware correction mechanism driven by internal model states. It's a novel combination and refinement of existing techniques tailored for enhanced trustworthiness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Implementing retrieval augmentation and accessing knowledge bases are standard practices. Developing an internal confidence scorer using attention patterns or uncertainty quantification is achievable with current ML techniques, although optimizing its accuracy presents a research challenge. The iterative correction loop is technically implementable. Evaluating on standard benchmarks is straightforward. The main challenges lie in effectively training the confidence scorer and managing the potential computational overhead of the iterative process, but these seem like solvable engineering and research problems rather than fundamental roadblocks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing factual incorrectness and inconsistency (hallucinations) in LLMs is one of the most critical challenges hindering their trustworthy deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law, as mentioned in the motivation. An effective automated error detection and correction mechanism would represent a major advancement, directly improving reliability and fostering user trust, aligning perfectly with the workshop's central theme. Success could significantly accelerate the safe adoption of LLMs."
