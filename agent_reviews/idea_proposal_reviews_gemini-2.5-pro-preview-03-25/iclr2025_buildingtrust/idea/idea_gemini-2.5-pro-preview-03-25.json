        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses 'Unlearning for LLMs', which is explicitly listed as point 5 in the workshop scope. It focuses on improving trustworthiness, facilitating compliance (privacy, safety), and addressing the limitations of current methods for removing undesirable content, all of which are central themes mentioned in the workshop description ('trustworthiness, safety, ethical implications', 'data privacy, regulatory compliance'). The idea is perfectly aligned with the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly. The motivation outlines the problem (cost of retraining, lack of speed/verification in unlearning) concisely. The main idea specifies the proposed approach (targeted model editing, e.g., ROME) and the crucial verification component (adversarial probes, influence functions). The expected outcomes (speed, verification, trustworthiness, compliance) are explicitly stated. The language is precise and unambiguous, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While model editing techniques (like ROME) and influence functions exist, applying targeted model editing specifically for rapid unlearning is a relevant area. The core novelty lies in the proposed integration of these editing techniques with a dedicated, robust verification module using adversarial probes and influence functions specifically designed to *certify* successful unlearning. This focus on verifiable, targeted unlearning offers a fresh perspective compared to broader unlearning approaches or model editing used solely for knowledge updates. It's a novel combination and application of existing concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The core techniques (targeted model editing, influence functions, adversarial testing) are established research areas with existing implementations. Therefore, the idea is largely feasible. However, challenges exist: 1) Precisely identifying the minimal parameter set for complex information. 2) Ensuring the editing process doesn't negatively impact unrelated model capabilities (catastrophic forgetting/interference). 3) Scaling influence function analysis and adversarial probe generation for large models can be computationally intensive. 4) Robustly verifying the *complete* removal of information is inherently difficult. While challenging, these aspects are active research areas, making the idea feasible within a research context, albeit requiring careful implementation and evaluation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant problem. The inability to efficiently and verifiably remove specific data (sensitive, biased, harmful, copyrighted) from LLMs is a major barrier to their trustworthy deployment and compliance with regulations like GDPR ('right to be forgotten'). A rapid and verifiable unlearning method would be a major breakthrough, significantly enhancing LLM safety, trustworthiness, and maintainability, directly impacting real-world applications and regulatory adherence. The emphasis on verification adds significant practical value."
