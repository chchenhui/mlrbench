    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (AI for drug discovery, specifically structure-based design, binding prediction, molecule optimization), the research idea (E(3)-equivariant GNN with hierarchical attention), and the literature review. It explicitly positions itself relative to cited works (EquiPocket, EquiCPI, HAC-Net) and directly aims to address the key challenges identified in the literature review (3D interactions, data, generalization, efficiency, interpretability). The objectives and methodology consistently follow the core idea and address relevant topics for the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, the methodology follows a logical progression (data, model, experiments), and the expected outcomes are specified. The model architecture, including E(3)-equivariance and hierarchical attention, is described with relevant mathematical context. The experimental design is comprehensive and easy to understand. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as more explicit details on the TFN implementation or the exact pooling mechanism for residue/pocket attention, but the overall proposal is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While E(3)-equivariance and attention mechanisms exist separately in the literature (as cited), the core novelty lies in the specific integration of E(3)-equivariance with a *multi-scale hierarchical* attention mechanism (atomic, residue, pocket levels) tailored for SBDD. This combination aims to achieve both geometric robustness and multi-level interpretability, distinguishing it from prior works that might focus on one aspect or use simpler attention schemes. The extension to attention-guided generative optimization further adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical foundations like E(3)-equivariant networks (TFNs) and attention mechanisms. The proposed message-passing scheme and hierarchical attention are conceptually sound. The experimental design is particularly strong, featuring relevant datasets, strong baselines, comprehensive metrics, robust validation strategies (multiple splits), and necessary ablation studies. Minor points, like the specific formulation for residue-level attention normalization or the reliance on docking scores for generative constraints, might require further justification or empirical refinement, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current methods and datasets (PDBbind, etc.). Implementing E(3)-equivariant networks and attention is achievable with existing libraries and expertise, although computationally intensive (acknowledged by the proposal). The main feasibility challenge lies in the generative optimization part, particularly ensuring chemical validity and meaningful exploration while using docking scores as constraints, which adds complexity and potential bias. Significant computational resources (GPUs) are required. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable with adequate resources and expertise, especially the predictive modeling part."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in drug discovery: improving the accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency of structure-based methods. Success would lead to substantial contributions, including potentially state-of-the-art binding affinity prediction, interpretable insights into interactions at multiple biological scales (atomic, residue, pocket), and a novel integrated framework for prediction and optimization. This could significantly impact drug discovery pipelines by reducing costs and timelines. The focus on interpretability alongside accuracy is particularly important for practical adoption."
