    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (AI for drug discovery, structure-based design, binding prediction, molecule optimization), the research idea (E(3)-equivariant GNNs + hierarchical attention for affinity prediction and generation), and the literature review (building on existing E(3) and attention methods). It directly addresses the core concepts and goals outlined in the provided context, positioning the work appropriately within the field and leveraging relevant prior art mentioned in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-structured and the objectives, significance, and overall approach are understandable. However, the clarity is significantly hampered by the lack of precise technical detail in the Methodology section. The mathematical formulations provided are overly simplistic and do not accurately represent the complexity of E(3)-equivariant layers or potentially hierarchical attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the description of the molecule generation process ('iteratively refining 3D candidate structures') is vague and lacks specifics on the algorithm used. These ambiguities require substantial clarification for a full understanding of the proposed implementation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers good novelty by integrating E(3)-equivariant GNNs with *hierarchical* attention mechanisms specifically for the dual tasks of high-precision binding affinity prediction and guided 3D molecule generation. While the literature review shows prior work on E(3)-equivariance and attention mechanisms separately or for related tasks, the proposed *combination* focusing on hierarchical attention within an E(3) framework for both prediction and generation appears distinct. It represents a thoughtful synthesis and potential advancement over existing methods rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is conceptually sound, leveraging appropriate techniques (E(3)-equivariance for geometry, attention for focus) for the problem. The choice of dataset (PDBbind) and evaluation metrics (MSE, RÂ², comparison of generated molecules) is standard and rigorous. However, the soundness is weakened by the inadequate mathematical formulations, which raise questions about the technical depth. Additionally, the lack of detail regarding the specific molecule generation/refinement algorithm makes it difficult to assess its rigor fully. The overall approach is plausible, but key technical details supporting its robustness are missing in the description."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required datasets (PDBbind, ZINC) are available, and the core techniques (E(3)-GNNs, attention) have existing implementations and libraries. However, training such complex models on 3D structural data is computationally intensive and requires significant GPU resources, which are not mentioned. Integrating the components and developing/tuning the specific hierarchical attention and guided generation parts might present moderate implementation challenges. Overall, it's feasible with adequate resources and expertise, but not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in drug discovery: improving the speed and accuracy of predicting protein-ligand interactions and generating promising lead candidates. Success in achieving high-precision affinity prediction and effective molecule generation, as targeted, would have a substantial impact by potentially reducing the time and cost of preclinical drug development and increasing the success rate of finding effective therapies. The research aligns directly with critical needs in the field."
