    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (AI for Drug Discovery, specifically structure-based design, binding prediction, molecule optimization), the research idea (E(3)-equivariant GNNs + hierarchical attention for SBDD), and the literature review (citing relevant works on equivariance and attention in molecular modeling). It directly addresses the core concepts and objectives outlined in the inputs, showing a clear understanding of the context and prior work. All sections reinforce the central theme without significant deviation."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides a good level of detail on data, preprocessing, architecture concepts (including equations), training, and evaluation. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise implementation details of the neural network components (e.g., exact architecture of phi_s, phi_v, MLPs) and the molecule generation loop, but this is acceptable for a proposal. Overall, the core ideas and plan are communicated effectively."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty. While E(3)-equivariant networks and attention mechanisms (including hierarchical ones) have been explored separately or in simpler combinations for molecular tasks (as shown in the literature review), the specific integration of E(3)-equivariance with a multi-level *hierarchical* attention mechanism (atom, residue, pocket) tailored for both high-precision binding affinity prediction *and* structure-guided molecule generation within a unified framework appears novel. It's a thoughtful combination of existing advanced techniques rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (E(3)-equivariance for geometric symmetry, attention for interaction focus). The methodology is well-reasoned, employing standard datasets, preprocessing techniques, and a comprehensive evaluation plan including benchmarks, cross-validation, temporal splits, ablation studies, and computational analysis. The mathematical formulations for message passing and attention are appropriate representations of the concepts. The inclusion of a structural loss term and multi-stage training adds to the rigor. Minor areas like the exact interplay between equivariance and attention, and the specifics of the generative model, would need careful implementation, but the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. Required datasets and software tools are available. However, implementing and training complex E(3)-equivariant networks with hierarchical attention is computationally intensive and requires significant expertise in geometric deep learning. The multi-stage training, hyperparameter optimization, and especially the iterative molecule generation component will demand substantial computational resources (GPU time). While the plan is realistic, successful execution depends on access to adequate resources and skilled personnel. The experimental validation component adds another layer of complexity dependent on external collaboration/resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical bottleneck in drug discovery: the accurate and efficient prediction of protein-ligand binding and the generation of promising candidate molecules. Improving structure-based drug design computationally has the potential for major impact by accelerating timelines, reducing costs, and improving success rates in pharmaceutical R&D. The expected outcomes (SOTA performance, interpretable insights, improved molecule generation) would represent substantial contributions to the field. The focus on interpretability further enhances its potential value to medicinal chemists."
