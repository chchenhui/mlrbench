    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly lists 'Genomic representation learning' as a key topic, which is the core focus of this proposal. Furthermore, the goals of improving drug response prediction, enabling personalized treatment strategies, and enhancing drug safety directly relate to other listed topics like 'Clinical outcomes prediction', 'Precision drug dosage', and 'Drug safety prediction'. The idea directly addresses the workshop's aim of using AI to accelerate drug discovery and improve patient outcomes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (personalized drug discovery), the main technical approach (deep learning, specifically autoencoders/VAEs, for genomic representation), the key steps (preprocessing, representation learning, model training, evaluation), and the expected outcomes (improved prediction, personalization, speed, safety). The language is concise and unambiguous, making the proposal easy to understand."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Using deep learning techniques like autoencoders and VAEs for representation learning on biological data, including genomics, is an established area of research. The novelty here lies more in the specific application and refinement for personalized drug discovery, aiming to integrate these representations effectively for predicting individual drug responses. While not introducing a fundamentally new representation learning paradigm, the focused application and potential for architectural or methodological refinements within this specific context provide a reasonable degree of originality."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Genomic datasets are increasingly available (though access and standardization can be challenging). Deep learning frameworks readily support autoencoders and VAEs. Standard evaluation protocols exist. The main challenges involve handling the high dimensionality and potential sparsity of genomic data, requiring significant computational resources for training deep models, and ensuring robust validation. However, these are known challenges in the field, and the proposed methods are standard enough to be implementable with current technology and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Personalized medicine based on genomics is a major frontier in healthcare. Successfully developing AI models that learn better genomic representations to predict individual drug responses could revolutionize treatment strategies, making them more effective and safer. This directly addresses the core challenges of drug discovery mentioned in the task description – cost, time, and uncertainty – potentially leading to major advancements in patient care and reducing healthcare costs."
