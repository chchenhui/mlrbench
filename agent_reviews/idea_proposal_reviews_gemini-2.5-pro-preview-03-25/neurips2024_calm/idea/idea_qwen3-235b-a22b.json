        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core problem outlined: enhancing the robustness and trustworthiness of large models, particularly under distribution shifts, by leveraging causality. This falls squarely under the workshop topic 'Causality for large models'. It tackles the challenge of translating causal theory into practical methods for large models and aims to answer 'how can this [trust] be improved?'. The focus on spurious correlations, generalization, high-stakes domains (healthcare), and integrating causal reasoning into pre-trained models mirrors the concerns and goals mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, problem statement, and the core concept of 'Causal Mediation Layers' (CMLs) are well-explained. The proposed two-step approach (identification via mediation analysis, intervention via specialized layers) is logical. The inclusion of an example (medical NLP) and evaluation strategy adds clarity. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of causal mediation analysis on large model sub-networks and the specific architecture/mechanisms of the 'intervention-aware layers', but the overall research direction and methodology are clearly conveyed for a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using causality for robustness and techniques like mediation analysis or counterfactual regularization exist, the specific proposal of 'Causal Mediation Layers' as distinct components integrated during fine-tuning of large pre-trained models is novel. The combination of identifying problematic pathways via mediation analysis and actively rewiring them using intervention-aware layers informed by both counterfactuals and domain knowledge graphs presents a fresh approach tailored to the architecture and scale of modern large models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Performing causal mediation analysis reliably and efficiently on complex, high-dimensional sub-networks of large models is non-trivial. Designing effective 'intervention-aware layers' and integrating counterfactual regularization without excessive computational overhead or unrealistic assumptions requires careful research. Reliance on pruned causal graphs necessitates accurate domain knowledge, which may not always be available or easy to formalize. While leveraging fine-tuning is practical, the complexity of the proposed layers and analyses requires considerable research and engineering effort, making implementation challenging but not impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of robustness and trustworthiness in large models, which currently hinders their reliable deployment in high-stakes applications like healthcare. Improving out-of-distribution generalization by mitigating reliance on spurious correlations is a major goal in ML. If successful, the proposed method offers a pathway to more reliable AI systems and could provide valuable tools for auditing model decisions through identified causal pathways, significantly advancing the field and enabling safer AI deployment."
