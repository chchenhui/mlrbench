    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the core question (B) 'Under what circumstances can we trust these large models and how can this be improved?' by proposing a method (CIL) to enhance robustness and reliability under distribution shifts. It falls squarely under the workshop topic 'Causality for large models: Applying ideas from causality to augment and improve large models'. The motivation aligns perfectly with the task's emphasis on trustworthiness, reliability, and the challenges of distribution shifts in real-world applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the main idea is broken down into three logical steps (identification, regularization, validation). However, the description of *how* these steps will be implemented (e.g., 'automatically identifying potential causal variables using a combination of intervention-based techniques and invariance tests', 'regularization framework') remains somewhat high-level and lacks specific technical details. While sufficient for an initial idea, further elaboration would be needed for a full understanding of the proposed methodology."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While concepts like causal invariance (e.g., IRM) exist, applying them specifically to the internal representations of large language models using a combination of interventions and invariance tests for identification, coupled with specific regularization and causal validation, represents a novel synthesis and application. The challenge and focus on adapting these causal principles to the scale and nature of LLMs contribute significantly to its originality within this specific context."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is satisfactory but presents significant challenges. Step 1 (identifying causal variables in high-dimensional LLM representations using interventions/invariance tests) is technically demanding and computationally expensive. Scaling these methods effectively is a major hurdle. Step 2 (designing effective regularization) and Step 3 (creating meaningful causal validation protocols simulating diverse shifts) also require substantial research and careful implementation. While conceptually plausible, the practical realization faces considerable technical difficulties that may require significant methodological innovation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Improving the robustness and trustworthiness of large models, especially under distribution shifts, is a critical challenge with profound implications for deploying these models in high-stakes domains (healthcare, policy-making, etc.), as highlighted in the task description. A successful CIL framework could lead to major advancements in reliable AI, directly addressing a key limitation of current large models and potentially enabling safer and more widespread adoption."
