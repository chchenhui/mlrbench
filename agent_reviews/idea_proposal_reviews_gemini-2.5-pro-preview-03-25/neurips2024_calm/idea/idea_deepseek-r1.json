        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses question (B) 'Under what circumstances can we trust these large models and how can this be improved?' by proposing a method using causality to enhance robustness and generalization, especially under distribution shifts and for safety-critical applications like healthcare, which are explicitly mentioned as concerns in the task description. The idea fits squarely into the workshop topic 'Causality for large models: Applying ideas from causality to augment and improve large models'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (robustness issues in LLMs), the main technical approach (causal discovery followed by causal regularization during fine-tuning), provides a concrete example (text generation, medical keywords), outlines a validation strategy (synthetic and real-world benchmarks), and specifies the intended impact (interpretability, robustness). The steps are logical and easy to follow, with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using causality for model robustness is an established research area (e.g., invariant prediction, causal representation learning), applying it specifically through a two-stage process (causal discovery on pre-training data, then regularization during fine-tuning) targeting the mechanisms (attention/gradients) of large language models is innovative. It represents a novel combination and application of causal principles tailored to the challenges and scale of modern LLMs."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Applying causal discovery methods effectively to massive, unstructured pre-training datasets is computationally expensive and methodologically complex. While regularizing attention or gradients is technically possible, ensuring it correctly enforces alignment with potentially complex or subtle causal features identified in the first step requires careful design and tuning. Accessing and utilizing appropriate real-world datasets (e.g., cross-hospital medical notes) also poses practical hurdles regarding privacy, access, and heterogeneity. Significant resources and expertise would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Improving the robustness and trustworthiness of large language models, especially under distribution shifts, is a critical challenge hindering their reliable deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare (as mentioned in the task description). Successfully developing models that generalize based on causal mechanisms rather than spurious correlations would represent a major advancement, potentially leading to more reliable, interpretable, and safer AI systems."
