    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core question (B) about improving LLM trustworthiness and robustness by applying causal techniques ('Causality for large models'). The methodology follows the research idea precisely (identify spurious correlations, generate counterfactuals, fine-tune). It also situates itself well within the provided literature, referencing the known issues of spurious correlations and the emerging use of counterfactuals for robustness and fairness in LLMs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The objectives, motivation, and overall approach are easy to understand. The methodology is broken down into logical steps. However, some sections lack specific detail, particularly Section 2.2 on how the different methods for identifying spurious correlations are integrated and how the 'simplified causal graph' is derived, and Section 2.3 on the precise mechanism for generating 'minimally altered' textual counterfactuals while keeping spurious correlates constant. While the overall concept is clear, these implementation details could be more explicit."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core idea of using counterfactual examples to fine-tune models for robustness or fairness is present in the provided literature review (e.g., papers 5, 6, 8). The novelty lies more in the specific proposed workflow: combining statistical/ML/causal discovery methods for identifying spurious correlations, generating *textual* counterfactuals based on a specific principle (minimal cause change, constant spurious correlate) derived from a simplified causal graph, and applying this to LLMs. It's a relevant application and potential refinement of existing ideas rather than a fundamentally new approach. The proposal doesn't strongly differentiate its specific contribution from prior work cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has potential weaknesses. The theoretical basis (using counterfactuals to break spurious correlations) is strong. However, the methodology relies on steps that are technically challenging and whose effectiveness is not guaranteed. Applying causal discovery algorithms (PC, FCI) directly to high-dimensional, unstructured text data is non-trivial and often requires strong assumptions. Generating high-quality, controlled textual counterfactuals that accurately reflect the intended intervention is a significant challenge. The reliance on a 'simplified' causal graph might also limit the approach's effectiveness if the simplification misses crucial factors. The evaluation metrics are appropriate, but measuring 'Causal Inference Accuracy' might require carefully constructed benchmarks or ground truth data."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Data collection and standard LLM fine-tuning are feasible, albeit resource-intensive. However, accurately identifying spurious correlations and, more significantly, automatically generating high-quality, controlled textual counterfactuals at scale is technically demanding and an active area of research. Applying formal causal discovery algorithms to raw text data effectively is also challenging. Success depends heavily on overcoming these technical hurdles and requires significant computational resources and potentially specialized expertise in both causality and NLP generation techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged problem in contemporary AI: the lack of robustness and trustworthiness in LLMs due to their reliance on spurious correlations. Improving out-of-distribution generalization and fairness is crucial for deploying LLMs in real-world, high-stakes applications. If successful, the proposed research could provide a valuable method for building more reliable LLMs, making a substantial contribution to the field and aligning perfectly with the goals outlined in the task description."
