    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core question of improving LLM trustworthiness and robustness ('Causality for large models') by tackling spurious correlations, which is the central theme of the research idea. The methodology builds logically on the concepts presented in the idea (counterfactual generation guided by simplified causal graphs, fine-tuning with consistency loss). Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to address challenges and build upon findings highlighted in the provided literature review (e.g., LLMs struggle with causation vs. correlation, challenges in counterfactual generation, prior work on counterfactual augmentation/fine-tuning)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The conceptual framework based on SCMs is explained well in a pragmatic context. The steps for methodology (identifying correlations, generating counterfactuals, CGFT loss function, evaluation plan) are detailed and easy to follow. The specific loss function and evaluation metrics are clearly specified. There are minimal ambiguities, making the research plan immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building upon existing concepts like counterfactual data augmentation (Doe & Smith, 2023) and causal fine-tuning ideas (Brown & Green, 2024), it proposes a specific, integrated framework (CGFT) with a distinct loss function emphasizing counterfactual consistency during fine-tuning. The semi-automated counterfactual generation method combining templates and LLM-as-editor, guided by simplified causal graphs, adds a practical dimension. The novelty lies in the specific combination and operationalization of these ideas into a coherent methodology, rather than a completely groundbreaking concept. It clearly distinguishes itself from standard fine-tuning and simple data augmentation baselines."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in causal inference principles (SCM, counterfactuals) and established ML techniques (fine-tuning, cross-entropy loss). The methodology is logical, linking the theoretical goal (learning invariant mechanisms) to the practical implementation (CGFT loss). The proposed evaluation plan is comprehensive, using relevant benchmarks, metrics (ID, OOD, Fairness), and baselines. Potential challenges, such as the quality of simplified causal graphs and generated counterfactuals, are acknowledged. The technical formulation of the loss function is clear and appropriate for the stated goal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Fine-tuning LLMs (like BERT-large or Llama variants) and using LLMs for generation are standard practices, although computationally intensive. The required datasets are publicly available benchmarks. The main challenges lie in the effective implementation of semi-automated counterfactual generation (requiring careful prompt engineering and quality control) and the computational resources needed for extensive fine-tuning and evaluation. These challenges are significant but manageable within a well-resourced research environment. The plan is generally realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of LLM robustness and trustworthiness by tackling spurious correlations, a major barrier to real-world deployment, especially in high-stakes domains. By leveraging causal principles, it aims to improve OOD generalization and fairness. Success would represent a substantial contribution to the 'Causality for large models' research area, potentially providing a practical tool for developers and advancing the development of more reliable and equitable AI systems. The potential scientific, technological, and societal impacts are clearly articulated and substantial."
