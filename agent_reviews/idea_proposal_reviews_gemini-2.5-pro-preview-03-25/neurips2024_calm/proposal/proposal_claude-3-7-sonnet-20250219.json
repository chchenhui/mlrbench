        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's question (B) about improving trust and robustness in large models by applying causal concepts ('Causality for large models'). It faithfully implements the core research idea of counterfactually guided fine-tuning to mitigate spurious correlations. Furthermore, it situates itself appropriately within the provided literature, referencing relevant recent work on causal reasoning in LLMs, counterfactual generation, and robustness, while aiming to tackle identified challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are specific and enumerated. The methodology is broken down into logical, detailed phases (identification, generation, fine-tuning, evaluation) with clear steps, proposed techniques (including formulas and pseudo-code for prompts), and evaluation metrics. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, although the core concept of using counterfactuals for fine-tuning LLMs exists in recent literature (as acknowledged by citing papers 5, 6, 8, etc.). The novelty lies in the systematic integration of several components: a specific method for quantifying spuriousness, a multi-pronged approach to counterfactual generation (template, LLM, controlled), the specific formulation of the counterfactual consistency loss within a comprehensive fine-tuning strategy (LoRA), and a detailed evaluation framework including causal reasoning assessment and a 'Causal Robustness Ratio'. It represents a strong synthesis and refinement of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in causal inference principles and standard LLM fine-tuning techniques. The methodology, including spurious correlation identification, counterfactual generation, consistency loss, and evaluation metrics, is logical and theoretically justified. Technical formulations are generally clear and appropriate. The main limitation, common in this area, is the reliance on the ability to accurately construct simplified causal graphs and generate high-fidelity counterfactuals, which involves inherent assumptions and practical difficulties. However, the proposed methods are reasonable strategies to address these challenges."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, assuming access to necessary computational resources (GPUs for fine-tuning and generation) and relevant datasets. The plan is ambitious, involving multiple tasks, models, generation techniques, and evaluation dimensions. Implementing the full pipeline, particularly the reliable identification of spurious features and high-quality counterfactual generation across diverse domains, presents significant technical challenges and requires careful execution and potentially domain expertise. However, the steps are conceptually sound and build on existing work, making it achievable with moderate effort and refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of LLM robustness and trustworthiness, particularly their tendency to rely on spurious correlations. Improving robustness, fairness, and out-of-distribution generalization through a causally-motivated approach would be a major contribution to the field, especially for deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications. The potential impact on developing more reliable AI systems is substantial."
