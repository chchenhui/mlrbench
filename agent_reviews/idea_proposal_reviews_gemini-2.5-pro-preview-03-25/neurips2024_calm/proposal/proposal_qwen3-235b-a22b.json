    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for improving LLM robustness and trustworthiness using causality ('Causality for large models'). The methodology precisely follows the research idea (identifying spurious correlations, generating counterfactual pairs based on causal graphs, using consistency loss). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, acknowledging LLM limitations (Jin et al., Kıcıman et al.) and leveraging existing counterfactual techniques (Doe & Smith, Johnson & Lee) while positioning itself within the current research landscape (White & Black, Brown & Green). The proposal explicitly links its objectives and expected outcomes to the workshop's directions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure with well-defined sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology provides considerable detail on data, causal graph specification, counterfactual generation techniques (rule-based and generative), the learning framework (loss functions, optimization), and the experimental setup (baselines, metrics, ablations). Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise method for initial causal graph identification and the exact implementation details of the T5-based counterfactual generator, but these do not significantly hinder understanding. Overall, the proposal is well-written and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core idea of using counterfactual examples/consistency for robustness or fairness in ML/NLP is not entirely new, as evidenced by the cited literature (Doe & Smith, 2023; Johnson & Lee, 2023). However, the proposal offers novelty in its specific, systematic framework: combining explicit causal graph guidance, both rule-based and generative (T5-based conditioned on interventions) counterfactual generation for LLMs, a specific consistency loss (symmetric KL/JS), and a two-step curriculum training strategy. While building on existing concepts, the integration and specific methodological choices provide a novel contribution to the practical application of causal principles for fine-tuning large language models for robustness."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in causal inference principles (counterfactual invariance) and standard machine learning techniques (fine-tuning, consistency loss). The motivation linking spurious correlations to robustness issues is valid. The proposed methodology, including causal graph specification, counterfactual generation, consistency loss, and evaluation metrics (robustness score, fairness differential), is logical and appropriate for the stated objectives. Potential challenges, such as the difficulty of specifying accurate causal graphs and ensuring the fidelity of generated counterfactuals (especially the generative ones), are inherent to the problem but the proposed approach is reasonable. The technical formulations appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It plans to use publicly available datasets (IMDb, AG News, Bios, CivilComments) and accessible LLMs (Llama-7B, T5). Fine-tuning procedures and implementing custom loss functions are standard practices. While specifying causal graphs requires care and the generative counterfactual approach needs careful implementation and validation, these tasks are achievable within a research context. The required computational resources for fine-tuning Llama-7B are significant but manageable. The experimental plan is well-defined and realistic. The primary risks involve the quality of causal inputs and the effectiveness of the training strategy, but these are research questions the proposal aims to address."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the lack of robustness and trustworthiness in LLMs due to reliance on spurious correlations. Improving robustness, fairness, and causal reasoning in LLMs has major implications for their safe deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance. The research directly contributes to the 'Causality for large models' theme outlined in the task description. Success would represent a substantial advancement in building more reliable AI systems and would likely have considerable practical and theoretical impact. The plan to release code and datasets further enhances its potential contribution to the research community."
