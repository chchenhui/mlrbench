        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 focus on 'Scaling up optimization' by proposing a method to extrapolate hyperparameters from smaller to larger models, explicitly tackling questions raised in the call about model size-dependent learning rates and reducing training costs/environmental impact. It fits perfectly within the suggested topics of 'Scaling laws' and 'Deep learning optimization'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (cost of tuning large models), the core proposal (learn hyperparameter scaling functions from smaller models and extrapolate), the methodology (train diverse models, fit functions, predict for large models), and the validation plan (transformers 10M-1B, compare to exhaustive search) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While scaling laws for model performance (e.g., loss) and hyperparameter optimization techniques are established areas, the specific focus on learning *explicit scaling functions for hyperparameters* (LR, batch size, momentum) based on model capacity metrics (params, FLOPs) for the purpose of *extrapolation* to significantly larger models offers a fresh perspective. It combines existing concepts in a targeted way to address a specific challenge in large-scale model training, moving beyond standard HPO or loss-based scaling laws."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Training smaller models with HPO sweeps is standard, and fitting scaling functions (regression, neural surrogates) is technically straightforward. Accessing models up to 1B parameters is achievable. However, the core challenge and research risk lie in whether simple, smooth scaling functions can reliably capture the complex relationship between model capacity and optimal hyperparameters, especially when extrapolating significantly. Ensuring the diversity of the initial model suite and the robustness of the learned functions are key practical hurdles. The claimed 80% compute reduction requires rigorous validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. The prohibitive cost of hyperparameter tuning for large models is a major bottleneck in ML research and deployment. Successfully developing a method to predict near-optimal hyperparameters for large models based on cheaper experiments on smaller ones would drastically reduce compute time, cost, and energy consumption, making large-scale AI more accessible and sustainable. This directly addresses a critical problem in the field with potential for major advancements."
