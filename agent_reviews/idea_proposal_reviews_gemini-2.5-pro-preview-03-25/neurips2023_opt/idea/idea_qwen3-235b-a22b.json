        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (OPT 2024 workshop call). It directly addresses the central theme of 'Scaling up optimization' by focusing on hyperparameter scaling laws for large models. It explicitly tackles key questions raised in the call, such as finding model size-dependent hyperparameters for extrapolation, optimizing under fixed compute budgets, and reducing training costs (time, money, energy). The proposed work fits squarely within the listed topics, particularly 'Scaling laws', 'Deep learning optimization', and 'Parallel and Distributed Optimization'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main idea (broken down into phases), and expected outcomes are well-defined. The core concept of using meta-optimization on smaller models to learn hyperparameter scaling laws for larger models is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific models used for scaling law discovery (regression vs. NN details) and the exact mechanism of 'light online optimization' for fine-tuning, but the overall research direction is clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While scaling laws and meta-optimization for hyperparameters exist independently, the proposed combination—specifically using meta-optimization to learn *hyperparameter scaling laws* across model sizes with explicit budget constraints and aiming for extrapolation to very large scales (>100B parameters)—offers a fresh perspective. Connecting empirical findings to theoretical convergence guarantees adds another layer of novelty. It's not entirely groundbreaking but represents a significant and innovative synthesis of existing concepts applied to a critical, contemporary problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents challenges. The meta-training phase requires substantial computational resources, although less than repeatedly tuning large models. The core challenge lies in the effectiveness of extrapolating scaling laws learned from 10M-100M parameter models to 100B+ parameter models; the success of this extrapolation is a key research question. Theoretical validation might also be complex. However, the individual components (training smaller models, regression/NN modeling, transfer) use existing techniques, making the overall approach plausible within a well-resourced research setting."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and costly problem of hyperparameter tuning for large-scale models. Successfully learning and applying hyperparameter scaling laws could drastically reduce computational costs, energy consumption, and development time for training state-of-the-art models. This aligns perfectly with the stated goals of the workshop and addresses a major bottleneck in the field, potentially leading to major advancements in efficient AI development."
