        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on 'Scaling up optimization' for LLMs, specifically tackling model-size-dependent learning rates and extrapolation from smaller models. The core idea of using spectral analysis (Hessian) to derive adaptive LR scaling laws matches the research idea perfectly. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024; Bjorck et al., 2024), positioning its contribution within the current research landscape by aiming for a more theoretically grounded and architecture-aware approach compared to existing power-law or SDE-based methods mentioned."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives (theoretical framework, empirical validation, open-source library), and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of data collection, model training, spectral analysis techniques (Hessian approximation, scaling law derivation), the adaptive framework (calibration, extrapolation), and the experimental design (baselines, metrics, ablations). The structure is logical, and the inclusion of a mathematical appendix further clarifies technical details. There is minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While scaling laws for LLMs and LR optimization are active research areas (as shown in the literature review), the specific approach of using *spectral analysis of the Hessian* (specifically the scaling of its dominant eigenvalue) to *derive* architecture-dependent learning rate scaling laws appears novel. It contrasts with cited works focusing on empirical power laws (Li et al.) or SDEs (Xie et al.). Linking the Hessian spectrum directly to model dimensions (width, depth, heads) for LR prediction offers a fresh, theoretically motivated perspective beyond simple parameter counts. The integration into an adaptive framework combining calibration and extrapolation further enhances the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It grounds the approach in established optimization theory (Hessian matrix properties, relationship between curvature/eigenvalues and optimal step size). The proposed methodology uses standard techniques like stochastic power iteration for eigenvalue approximation and regression for fitting scaling laws. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Minor potential weaknesses include the computational cost and stability of Hessian eigenvalue estimation during training (though stochastic methods mitigate this partially) and the strong assumption that the relationship between the dominant eigenvalue and model dimensions follows a predictable (generalized) power law across diverse architectures, which requires robust empirical validation. The mathematical formulations presented are correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Training multiple LLMs up to 1B parameters requires substantial computational resources, although this is typical for LLM research. Estimating Hessian eigenvalues adds computational overhead compared to standard training, even with efficient methods like power iteration. The success hinges on the empirical validation of the core hypothesis: that stable and predictive scaling laws derivable from Hessian spectra exist and generalize well. While the techniques (PyTorch/JAX, power iteration) are standard, the scale of experiments and the potential scientific risk (the hypothesized relationships might be noisy or less general than hoped) make it challenging, though achievable in a well-resourced setting."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in AI development: the enormous computational cost and inefficiency of training large language models. Finding principled ways to set hyperparameters like learning rates based on model scale could lead to substantial savings in time, money (estimated 25-40% cost reduction), and energy consumption, aligning with sustainable AI goals. Success would advance the understanding of optimization dynamics in deep learning and provide a valuable practical tool (open-source library) for the research community and industry, potentially accelerating AI progress by lowering training barriers."
