    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly consistent with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Scaling up optimization' for LLMs, focusing on deriving model size-dependent learning rate scaling laws to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and lessen environmental impact, all key points mentioned in the task description. The methodology aligns perfectly with the research idea (Hessian analysis, empirical studies, extrapolation, open-source library). It also situates itself well within the context provided by the literature review, aiming to contribute to the ongoing research on scaling laws for LLM hyperparameters."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear and well-structured. The introduction sets the context, the objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology is broken down into logical steps. The significance and expected outcomes are also clearly stated. However, the 'Mathematical Formulation' section is quite high-level, presenting a generic function `f` and a proportionality relationship involving Hessian eigenvalues without specifying the proposed form of `f` or how the spectral information will be practically integrated and calibrated. The 'Experimental Design' could also benefit from more specifics (e.g., range of model sizes, specific architectures, datasets). Overall, the main ideas are understandable, but key technical details lack precision."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a timely topic, but its novelty is somewhat limited given the cited literature. Several recent papers (Li et al. 2025, Xie et al. 2024, Bjorck et al. 2024) already focus specifically on deriving scaling laws for optimal learning rates in LLMs, with Li et al. even providing a tool. The proposal's suggested method of combining Hessian spectral analysis with empirical observations across different architectures offers some potential novelty in its specific approach, particularly the emphasis on architecture-specific adjustments (`A` in the function `f`). However, the proposal does not strongly articulate how this combination significantly differs from or improves upon the very recent existing work. It appears more as an incremental refinement or exploration of similar ideas rather than a groundbreaking approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has a plausible conceptual basis, linking learning rates to Hessian properties and empirical scaling, which aligns with optimization theory and recent research trends. However, the technical soundness is questionable due to a lack of detail. Key challenges, such as the efficient and accurate estimation of relevant Hessian spectral properties for large models (full Hessian computation is intractable) and the specific mathematical form of the scaling function `f`, are not adequately addressed. The proposed proportionality `eta \\propto sum(1/lambda_i)` is a simplification of complex optimization dynamics. The methodology lacks rigor regarding how the spectral analysis and empirical data will be combined and validated for reliable extrapolation, especially to 'arbitrary size' transformers."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal's feasibility is uncertain and presents significant challenges. Training 'a series of LLMs with varying sizes' requires substantial computational resources (GPU clusters, time), which are not specified as being available. Estimating Hessian spectral information for large models is technically demanding. Developing and validating scaling laws that generalize reliably across architectures and scales is inherently difficult. While the steps are conceptually possible, successful execution depends heavily on access to large-scale compute infrastructure and deep technical expertise in both LLM training and numerical analysis, which are not detailed in the proposal. The implementation of a robust open-source library also requires considerable engineering effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the field: the immense cost and resource consumption of training large language models. Developing methods to predict optimal learning rates based on model scale could lead to substantial savings in computation time, cost, and energy, thereby reducing the environmental impact of AI. This aligns perfectly with the goals outlined in the task description. If successful, the research and the resulting open-source library could have a considerable practical impact on the ML community, making large model training more accessible and efficient."
