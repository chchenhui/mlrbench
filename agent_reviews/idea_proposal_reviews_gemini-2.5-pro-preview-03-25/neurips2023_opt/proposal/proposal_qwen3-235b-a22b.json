        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 call for 'scaling up optimization' by focusing on learning rate scaling laws for LLMs based on model size, a key question raised in the task description. The methodology, centered around Hessian spectral analysis to derive these laws, perfectly matches the research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to build upon/differentiate from recent relevant works identified in the literature review (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024), demonstrating a clear understanding of the current research landscape and its challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Outcomes), and the objectives are explicitly stated. The multi-phase methodology is detailed, outlining specific steps, model variations, data scaling, and evaluation metrics. Key concepts like Hessian estimation and the proposed meta-model are presented with formulas. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for searching 'learned manifolds' and the theoretical derivation or justification for the specific form of the meta-model relating learning rate to Hessian metrics (\\\\\\\\eta^* = \\\\\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\cdot (\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\tau}{\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\lambda + \\\\\\\\epsilon})^\\\\\\\\beta) and the dynamic adjustment factor. However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the literature review shows existing work on hyperparameter scaling laws (Li et al., Xie et al.), this proposal's core novelty lies in its specific approach: using *Hessian spectral properties* (trace and spectral width) as the primary mechanism to derive and potentially dynamically adapt these scaling laws. This curvature-informed approach is distinct from prior methods focusing on empirical power laws or SDEs without explicitly linking scaling to these specific Hessian metrics. The proposal clearly articulates this difference and positions the work as a 'first formal framework connecting spectral curvature analysis to hyperparameter scaling'."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid optimization concepts (Hessian analysis, eigenvalues) and employs standard techniques (Hessian vector products, stochastic power iteration). The experimental methodology is comprehensive, including ablation studies, scaling verification, and comparisons against strong baselines. However, the central theoretical contribution – the specific meta-model form \\\\\\\\eta^* = \\\\\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\cdot (\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\tau}{\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\lambda + \\\\\\\\epsilon})^\\\\\\\\beta and the extrapolation method – appears to be a plausible but primarily empirical ansatz. While motivated by curvature, its precise mathematical derivation isn't fully detailed, relying on fitting parameters \\\\\\\\alpha, \\\\\\\\beta. The dynamic adjustment formula also seems somewhat heuristic. These aspects require strong empirical validation, slightly weakening the theoretical rigor compared to a fully derived model."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning computational resources. The plan involves training numerous transformer models across wide ranges of width, depth, data scales (up to 10B parameters), and other variations, which is extremely expensive. Furthermore, computing Hessian spectral properties, even using efficient methods like power iteration on Hessian-vector products, adds non-trivial overhead, especially if done frequently ('on-the-fly'). While the techniques themselves are implementable in standard frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow), securing the necessary compute budget to execute the full experimental plan as described poses a major practical hurdle. The acknowledged sensitivity to hardware also adds complexity."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and costly problem of hyperparameter tuning (specifically learning rates) in large-scale LLM training. Successfully developing a principled, curvature-informed method for predicting optimal learning rates based on model scale could lead to substantial reductions in computational cost (estimated 25-40%), energy consumption, and time-to-deployment for LLMs. This has major economic and environmental implications. The theoretical insights into the relationship between optimization landscapes (curvature) and scaling, along with the planned open-source library (ALS-Lib), represent substantial potential contributions to the field, aligning perfectly with the goals of the OPT 2024 workshop."
