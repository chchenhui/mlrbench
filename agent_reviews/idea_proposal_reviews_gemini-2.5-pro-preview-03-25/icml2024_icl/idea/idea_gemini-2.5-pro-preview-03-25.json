        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (ICL 2024 workshop). It proposes a new algorithm (meta-learned prompt optimization) aimed at improving ICL performance and robustness, directly addressing the call for 'algorithms' and 'empirical studies' related to ICL. Furthermore, it explicitly explores the 'relationship between ICL and few-shot learning, meta-learning and automated machine learning (AutoML)', which is listed as a specific topic of interest. The focus on optimizing prompts also relates to understanding factors that 'enable or improve ICL'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (brittle manual prompts) is explicitly stated. The core proposal (meta-learning for prompt structure optimization) is clearly articulated, including the objective (minimize downstream loss) and potential methods (gradient-based, RL). The expected outcomes (automated, robust prompts) are also clearly specified. The description is concise and leaves little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While automated prompt optimization and meta-learning are existing areas, applying meta-learning specifically to optimize the discrete structural aspects of ICL prompts (demonstration selection, ordering, formatting) for robustness is a relatively fresh perspective. Many existing methods focus on optimizing continuous prompt embeddings or generating task instructions. This approach tackles the combinatorial challenge of demonstration curation within the prompt using a meta-learning framework, offering a distinct angle compared to much prior work."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Meta-learning typically requires significant computational resources, especially when the inner loop involves querying large language models. Optimizing in a discrete space (prompt structure) using RL can suffer from high variance and sample inefficiency, while gradient-based methods would require suitable relaxations (e.g., Gumbel-Softmax) which might affect performance. Defining and sourcing a diverse set of ICL tasks for meta-training is also non-trivial. However, these challenges are common in meta-learning research and likely surmountable within a well-resourced research environment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant with clear impact potential. Manual prompt engineering is a major bottleneck in effectively utilizing ICL, often requiring extensive trial-and-error and lacking robustness. An automated method for generating high-performing, robust prompts would be a valuable contribution, making ICL more practical, reliable, and accessible. Success in this area could lead to meaningful improvements in how LLMs are applied to new tasks and contribute to the broader understanding of ICL mechanisms and AutoML for foundation models."
