    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's topics by proposing a new architecture (CICL) and training paradigm (self-supervised contrastive pretraining) to improve ICL, evaluating its performance, and aiming to explore its relationship with other learning paradigms like few-shot learning. It faithfully expands on the core research idea, maintaining the motivation and proposed components (cross-example attention, contrastive objective, example selection). Furthermore, it effectively synthesizes concepts present in the literature review, such as contrastive learning approaches (Papers 1-5, 7, 9, 10), cross-example attention (Paper 6), and example selection (Papers 3, 8), positioning the work within the current research landscape and addressing identified challenges like modeling inter-example relationships."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology (CICL components), and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The structure is logical. However, some aspects lack specific detail, slightly hindering full clarity. For instance, the exact implementation of the 'cross-example attention mechanism' beyond the standard formula and how it integrates with existing LLM architectures is not detailed. The pretraining strategy mentions a contrastive objective but doesn't specify how positive/negative pairs are constructed or sampled in the context of ICL pretraining. The 'inference-time example selection algorithm' mentions possibilities (clustering, NN) but doesn't define the chosen approach. Critically, the inclusion of a 'Fine-Tuning' step (3.2.4) introduces ambiguity, as ICL typically aims to avoid task-specific fine-tuning; clarification is needed on whether this refers to base model tuning or contradicts the ICL paradigm."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like contrastive learning for ICL (Papers 1-5, 7, 9, 10), cross-example attention (Paper 6), and example selection (Papers 3, 8) exist in the literature, the proposed CICL framework integrates them in a novel way. Specifically, the combination of a self-supervised contrastive *pretraining* objective designed to explicitly teach inter-example reasoning, coupled with a cross-example attention mechanism *during inference*, and an optimized example selection strategy presents a fresh approach. It distinguishes itself from prior work focusing on contrastive decoding at inference (Paper 1), using negative examples in prompts (Paper 2), or contrastive objectives solely for example selection (Paper 3). The synthesis aims to tackle ICL limitations from a new angle."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established principles like attention mechanisms and contrastive learning. The core idea of leveraging inter-example relationships via contrastive pretraining is theoretically plausible and supported by representation learning literature. The mathematical formulations provided are standard. However, rigor is slightly diminished by the lack of detail on the specific contrastive task design (pair sampling, similarity definition for pretraining) and the precise architectural integration of cross-example attention. The most significant point needing justification is the 'Fine-Tuning' step mentioned in the experimental design, which seems potentially inconsistent with the zero-shot/few-shot nature of ICL and requires clarification to ensure methodological soundness within the ICL context."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Implementing cross-example attention might require non-trivial modifications to standard LLM architectures. The self-supervised contrastive pretraining phase will likely demand substantial computational resources, potentially exceeding standard LLM pretraining depending on the complexity of the contrastive task and sampling strategy. Designing an effective contrastive pretraining task that genuinely improves ICL is a research challenge in itself. While the experimental plan is standard, the successful implementation hinges on significant engineering effort and access to large-scale compute. The inference-time example selection adds another layer of complexity and potential latency. Therefore, while conceptually achievable, practical implementation faces considerable hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation in current ICL approaches â€“ the tendency to treat context examples independently. Improving the ability of models to understand and leverage relationships between examples could lead to major advancements in sample efficiency and generalization for ICL. Success in this research could make large models more adaptable and practical for real-world tasks where labeled data is scarce. The research also promises valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying ICL and its connections to other learning paradigms, contributing substantially to the field's understanding. The potential impact on how LLMs are trained and utilized is considerable."
