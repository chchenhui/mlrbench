        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for new architectures and algorithms for ICL by proposing CICL. The methodology clearly expands on the core concepts outlined in the research idea (contrastive learning, cross-example attention, example selection). Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, acknowledging related works (ICCD, CEIL, contrastive pretraining, cross-example attention) and aiming to tackle key challenges identified in the review, such as modeling inter-example relationships and improving robustness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is broken down into logical components (Data, Architecture, Selection, Experiments). Key mechanisms like cross-example attention and the contrastive objective are presented with mathematical formulations. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of 'similar outputs' for defining positive/negative pairs in regression tasks during contrastive pretraining, or the exact calculation of the 'contrastive gain' metric, but these do not significantly obscure the core proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating three distinct techniques—contrastive pretraining focused on inter-example relationships, an explicit cross-example attention mechanism at inference, and DPP-based example selection—into a unified framework (CICL). While the literature review shows that individual components (contrastive learning for ICL, cross-example attention, DPP selection) have been explored separately or in different combinations (e.g., CEIL uses contrastive learning for selection kernel), the specific synergy proposed here, particularly the focus on contrastive *pretraining* for relational reasoning combined with the other elements, offers a fresh perspective distinct from prior work like contrastive decoding (ICCD)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (Transformer attention, contrastive learning principles, Determinantal Point Processes). The proposed methodology, including the cross-example attention mechanism, the contrastive loss formulation, and the use of DPPs for selection, is technically sound. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant benchmarks, noise injection protocols, strong baselines from the literature (CEIL, ICCD), appropriate metrics, and planned ablation studies. The link between contrastive pretraining on example relationships and improved ICL performance via cross-example attention is plausible, though requires empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The core components rely on standard deep learning techniques and libraries. Public datasets are proposed for evaluation. However, the contrastive pretraining phase could be computationally expensive, depending on the model size and pretraining data volume. Implementing the cross-example attention efficiently, especially for larger context sets, might pose engineering challenges. Tuning the various components (contrastive temperature, DPP parameters) may require significant effort. Overall, it's feasible with adequate computational resources and engineering expertise, but not without potential hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses critical limitations in ICL: sample efficiency, robustness to noise, and the underutilization of relationships between context examples. Improving these aspects is crucial for the practical deployment of LLMs, especially in low-resource or dynamic settings. If successful, CICL could lead to major advancements in how models adapt using context, potentially impacting various application domains. The research also promises theoretical insights into relational reasoning within ICL and benefits the community through open-sourced contributions."
