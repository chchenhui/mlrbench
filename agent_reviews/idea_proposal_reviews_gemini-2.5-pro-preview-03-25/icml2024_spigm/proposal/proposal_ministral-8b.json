        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of structured probabilistic modeling (graph normalizing flows), encoding domain knowledge (physics-based energy penalty), applications in science (molecular conformation generation), and challenges in sampling and inference. The objectives and methodology perfectly reflect the research idea, and the proposal explicitly aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as incorporating physical constraints, ensuring invariance, and achieving efficient sampling."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The background, objectives, overall methodology, evaluation plan, and expected impact are articulated well. However, it lacks specific details on crucial technical aspects. For instance, the exact mechanism for achieving rotational and translational invariance within the invertible graph flow layers is not described, nor is the specific 'lightweight force-field approximation' identified. While the high-level concepts are clear, these omissions create some ambiguity regarding the precise implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While graph normalizing flows and physics-informed machine learning are existing concepts, their specific combination for molecular *conformation* generation, explicitly optimizing a dual objective (likelihood + physics-based energy) within an invariant flow framework, appears novel. It distinguishes itself from recent works like ConfFlow (which avoids explicit physics) and GeoDiff (which uses diffusion models). The integration of these specific elements to address the challenges highlighted in the literature constitutes a fresh approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is based on sound theoretical foundations (normalizing flows, GNNs, physics-informed ML, geometric deep learning principles like invariance). The proposed dual objective and evaluation metrics are appropriate. However, the lack of technical detail regarding the design of the invariant and invertible graph flow layers, and the specific force field used, prevents a full assessment of rigor. Ensuring simultaneous invertibility and invariance in graph flows can be complex, and the choice of force field impacts the physical realism. While the overall approach is sound, the technical formulation requires further specification to confirm its complete correctness and robustness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML techniques and computational resources (GPUs, standard libraries like PyTorch, RDKit). Public datasets like ZINC are available. The main challenges are technical: designing and implementing the invariant graph flow layers and efficiently integrating the physics-based energy calculation into the training loop. These are significant research and engineering tasks but appear solvable within the scope of a research project. It requires expertise in GNNs, normalizing flows, and computational chemistry, but doesn't seem fundamentally impractical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in drug discovery and materials science â€“ the efficient generation of physically realistic molecular conformations. Current methods have limitations that the proposal aims to overcome. Success would lead to faster and more reliable computational tools for exploring chemical space, potentially accelerating the discovery of new molecules with desired properties. The focus on incorporating domain knowledge (physics) into generative models is also a significant trend in scientific ML."
