    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on structured probabilistic modeling (graph normalizing flows for molecular graphs), incorporating domain knowledge (physics-based energy penalties), and applications in science (molecular conformation generation). It clearly builds upon the research idea by detailing the methodology. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself against the methods mentioned in the literature review (ConfFlow, GeoDiff, MolGrow, GraphEBM), aiming to overcome their limitations (lack of physical constraints, slow sampling) by integrating physics into a flow-based model, directly tackling the key challenges identified."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology and expected impact. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section clearly outlines data representation, the core model architecture (Graph Invertible Bottleneck layers, physics-informed loss), and a comprehensive experimental plan including datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Mathematical notations are used appropriately and explained. The significance and expected outcomes are articulated concisely."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While graph normalizing flows and physics-informed machine learning exist separately, the specific combination of a graph-based normalizing flow architecture (GIB layers) with an integrated, differentiable physics-based energy penalty (approximated force field) directly in the loss function for molecular conformation generation is innovative. It distinguishes itself clearly from cited works: ConfFlow lacks explicit physics, GeoDiff uses slower diffusion, MolGrow focuses on graph generation (not conformation), and GraphEBM uses slower EBM sampling. The novelty lies in unifying fast sampling via flows with explicit physical realism during training."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (normalizing flows, GNNs, molecular mechanics, equivariant networks). The proposed methodology, combining NLL loss with a physics-based energy term, is a well-justified approach for incorporating domain knowledge. The use of GIB layers for invertibility and graph structure processing is appropriate. The mathematical formulations presented are standard and appear correct. Minor points requiring further detail in a full implementation include the precise nature and accuracy of the differentiable force-field approximation (U_{\\\\phi}) and ensuring numerical stability and efficiency of the GIB layer's Jacobian computation. The handling of roto-translational invariance within the flow architecture could be slightly more explicit."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages standard datasets (GEOM-Drugs, PubChem) and relies on established techniques (GNNs, normalizing flows) implementable with current deep learning libraries. Cheminformatics tools for preprocessing and force field calculations are available. The main challenges lie in developing an effective differentiable force-field approximation and potentially high computational costs for training, which are common in this field. The experimental plan is realistic. While achieving the ambitious performance targets (>95% validity, <1s sampling) presents a challenge, the overall approach is practical and implementable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and well-recognized problem in computational chemistry and drug discovery â€“ the efficient generation of physically valid and diverse molecular conformations. Success would represent a major advancement over existing methods, potentially accelerating virtual screening, lead optimization, and materials design. By demonstrating how to effectively integrate first-principles physics into deep generative models (specifically flows), the work also has broader methodological implications for physics-informed AI in other scientific domains. The potential impact is substantial."
