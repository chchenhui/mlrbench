    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly seeks methods that leverage additional information beyond standard ERM for domain generalization, and lists 'Exploiting multiple modalities to achieve robustness to distribution shift' as a specific topic of interest. The proposed idea directly addresses this by using cross-modal consistency within multi-modal data as a supervisory signal to learn domain-invariant representations, aiming for robustness against distribution shifts. It perfectly aligns with the workshop's goal of identifying and leveraging extra sources of information for successful DG."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation regarding spurious correlations and the limitations of simple multi-modal fusion is well-explained. The core concept of using cross-modal prediction consistency (or inconsistency) as a regularization signal is understandable. The mechanism involving unimodal and joint predictions and a consistency loss is described. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise formulation of the consistency loss and the method for identifying samples where shifts are likely (e.g., 'unsupervised clustering' needs more detail), but the overall research direction is clearly defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using multi-modal data for robustness or consistency regularization isn't entirely new, the specific framing of using the *divergence* between unimodal and joint predictions as a signal to identify and mitigate reliance on *domain-specific spurious features* within the context of domain generalization offers a fresh perspective. It differs from standard multi-modal contrastive learning (which often enforces agreement) by potentially leveraging disagreement under shift as the key signal. It combines elements from multi-modal learning, consistency regularization, and DG in a specific and interesting way."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It requires paired multi-modal data across multiple source domains, which exists for certain tasks but might be a constraint for others. The proposed mechanism involves training unimodal and joint models and implementing a custom loss function, which is technically achievable with standard deep learning frameworks. The computational cost would be higher than unimodal training but is typical for multi-modal research. Identifying samples likely affected by domain shifts adds a layer of complexity but can be approached using domain labels (if available) or unsupervised methods, making it generally implementable, albeit with potential data acquisition challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Domain generalization is a critical challenge for deploying reliable ML systems, and current methods often struggle. As highlighted by the task description, finding effective ways to leverage additional information is crucial. This idea proposes a principled approach using readily available (in some contexts) multi-modal signals. If successful, it could lead to models that are genuinely more robust to domain shifts by learning representations grounded in cross-modal consensus, offering a meaningful contribution to the field and addressing a key limitation of existing DG approaches."
