        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central question ('What do we need for successful domain generalization?') by proposing the use of domain-level metadata, a specific topic of interest mentioned. The methodology follows the research idea closely, integrating causal discovery using domain labels with representation learning. It appropriately cites and builds upon relevant work from the literature review (e.g., CIRL, CCM, DICA), positioning itself within the current research landscape and addressing key challenges identified therein, such as identifying invariant features and integrating causality with deep learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is broken down into logical stages with specific algorithmic steps, architectural components, and loss functions. Mathematical formulations are provided to support the concepts. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for splitting the latent representation Z into causal (Z_C) and non-causal (Z_N) partitions based on the inferred graph G, and some details on the practical implementation of counterfactual validation could be elaborated. However, the core ideas and plan are well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing concepts like causal inference for DG (CIRL, CCM) and invariant representation learning (DICA), it proposes a specific and novel approach: using domain-level metadata explicitly to perform *conditional* causal discovery across multiple domains, identifying invariant causal structures as the *intersection* of domain-specific graphs, and integrating this structure via differentiable constraints (MI minimization, counterfactual consistency) into deep representation learning. This explicit use of metadata for multi-domain causal structure distillation and its formal integration appears distinct from prior work mentioned, which might use causality more heuristically or assume a single underlying graph."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established theoretical foundations (causal inference, SCMs, invariance principles) and methods (PC algorithm, NOTEARS, MI estimation via InfoNCE). The proposed losses are conceptually appropriate for enforcing causal invariance and independence. However, the reliance on causal discovery from observational data, especially in high dimensions (images), is a significant challenge and rests on strong, often untestable assumptions (causal sufficiency, faithfulness), which are acknowledged but represent a potential weakness. The practical accuracy of Stage 1 (Causal Discovery) heavily influences the success of subsequent stages. The mechanism for partitioning the latent space (Z_C, Z_N) based on the graph needs more rigorous definition."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible within a research context, outlining a structured plan using existing tools (CausalDiscoveryToolbox, PyTorch) and benchmarks (DomainBed). However, it presents significant implementation challenges. Causal discovery from high-dimensional observational data is computationally intensive and notoriously difficult to get right. Integrating the inferred graph structure effectively and differentiably into the deep learning pipeline, including robust MI estimation and tuning multiple loss terms, requires considerable expertise and effort. The 10-month timeline seems ambitious given the complexity and research nature of the tasks, particularly achieving the targeted 5% improvement over SOTA. Access to suitable compute resources is implicitly required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and persistent problem in machine learning: domain generalization. The documented failure of existing methods to consistently outperform ERM highlights the need for new approaches. By tackling this challenge through the lens of causality and leveraging domain metadata, the research has the potential for major impact. If successful, it could lead to substantially more robust and reliable models for high-stakes applications like medical imaging and autonomous driving, directly contributing valuable insights and potentially a practical framework to the field, and directly answering the core question posed by the workshop."
