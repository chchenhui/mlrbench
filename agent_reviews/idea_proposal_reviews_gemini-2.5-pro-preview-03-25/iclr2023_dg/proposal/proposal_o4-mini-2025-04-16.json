        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core question by proposing causal structure as the 'additional information' needed for successful DG, leveraging domain-level metadata as suggested. It meticulously elaborates on the research idea, detailing the integration of causal discovery and invariant representation learning. Furthermore, it situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging prior causal DG methods (CCM, CIRL, Contrastive ACE) and explicitly aiming to tackle the key challenges identified in the review, such as identifying invariant features and integrating causal discovery with deep learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure with distinct sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology is broken down into understandable components (Latent Causal Graph Inference, Invariant Representation Learning, Joint Optimization), each explained with specific techniques (NOTEARS extension, HSIC regularization) and supported by mathematical formulations. The experimental design is detailed and unambiguous, covering datasets, protocols, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The overall concept and execution plan are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While leveraging existing concepts like causal discovery (NOTEARS), invariance regularization (HSIC), and autoencoders, the core novelty lies in their specific integration: jointly learning a latent causal graph using multi-domain data and domain metadata, and then using this dynamically inferred graph structure to guide the invariant representation learning by penalizing dependence specifically on the identified 'non-causal' latent variables. This specific mechanism of joint, graph-guided invariance learning for DG appears distinct from the cited prior work (e.g., CCM, CIRL, Contrastive ACE), which employ different causal strategies. It represents a fresh combination and refinement of ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but relies on strong assumptions that might limit its practical robustness. The use of NOTEARS for latent causal discovery from observational data is ambitious; its success is sensitive to assumptions (linearity, acyclicity, Gaussian noise mentioned for theory) and optimization stability, and identifiability from observational data alone is challenging, even with multi-domain information. The linear SCM assumption (h = Ah + \\\\epsilon) might be too restrictive for complex data like images. While the theoretical analysis and generalization bound provide justification, their applicability depends heavily on these assumptions holding. The partitioning of latents based solely on outgoing edges in the learned graph is a simplification. The overall approach is logically coherent, but the reliability of the core causal discovery component in complex, real-world settings is a significant concern impacting overall soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. The individual components (CNNs, autoencoders, HSIC, NOTEARS-like optimization) are known and implementable with standard deep learning frameworks. However, integrating them into a stable joint optimization loop, especially with the non-convex acyclicity constraint from NOTEARS and multiple loss terms, will require careful engineering and extensive hyperparameter tuning. The computational cost might be significant, particularly the graph learning part. The experimental plan using DomainBed and a medical dataset is standard and achievable. The main risk lies in the practical difficulty of reliably learning meaningful causal graphs and optimizing the complex objective function effectively."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: domain generalization. The failure of models under distribution shift is a major barrier to real-world deployment, especially in safety-critical areas like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, which the proposal explicitly targets. By aiming to learn invariant causal mechanisms instead of spurious correlations, the research has the potential to lead to substantially more robust and reliable models, representing a major advancement over current DG methods that often fail to beat simple ERM baselines. Success would have considerable practical impact and contribute valuable insights into the integration of causality and deep representation learning."
