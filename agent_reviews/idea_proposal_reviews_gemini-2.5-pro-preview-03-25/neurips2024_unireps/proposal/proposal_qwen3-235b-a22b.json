        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the workshop (understanding and unifying representations across models) by proposing a specific method (TCFA) for model merging, which is a key practical application mentioned. The proposal fully embodies the research idea, detailing the motivation, main concept (task-conditioned functional alignment in activation space), and mechanism (probing, OT/CCA, lightweight stitching). It explicitly references concepts from the literature review (CRH, stitching) and directly tackles several of the identified key challenges (Architectural Disparities, Task Distribution Variability, Computational Efficiency, Generalization Assurance - Challenges 1, 2, 4, 5). The methodology and objectives are perfectly consistent with the stated goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology, including data selection, the functional probing protocol, the alignment frameworks (HOT, CCCA with equations), and the stitching architecture, is explained with high precision. The experimental plan, including baselines, metrics, and ablations, is clearly laid out. Minor details, such as the exact implementation of the task-conditioned filter \\\\mathcal{F}_c or the training specifics of the gating weights, could be slightly more elaborated, but the overall proposal is immediately understandable and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While functional alignment and model merging are existing areas, the core idea of *Task-Conditioned* Functional Alignment (TCFA) specifically for merging *heterogeneous* architectures by aligning activation manifolds based on shared task conditions appears novel. It distinguishes itself from standard parameter-space merging (like TiesMerging, mentioned as a baseline) and non-conditioned activation alignment (also a baseline). It also differs from the cited works like SARA (focused on training diffusion models) or CRH (focused on alignment during training). The novelty lies in the specific combination of task-conditioning, functional alignment techniques (HOT/CCCA applied conditionally), and lightweight stitching for cross-architecture merging of pre-trained models."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in representation learning and functional alignment. The chosen methodologies (Optimal Transport, Canonical Correlation Analysis) are well-established and appropriate for comparing distributions and finding correlations between activation spaces. The mathematical formulations provided are correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines (parameter-space, activation-space without conditioning, architecture-specific methods), comprehensive metrics (performance, efficiency, generality, alignment quality using CKA), and well-chosen ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components (task granularity, architecture gap, training strategy). The approach is theoretically grounded and methodologically rigorous."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on standard benchmarks (ImageNet, GLUE) and readily available pre-trained models. The core techniques (activation extraction, OT, CCA, training small neural networks for stitching/gating) are computationally feasible with standard ML hardware and software libraries (PyTorch/TensorFlow, POT, scikit-learn). The emphasis on *lightweight* stitching layers explicitly targets computational efficiency, enhancing feasibility. While achieving the targeted performance gains is a research risk, the steps outlined to implement and evaluate the method are realistic and straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical challenges in model merging, particularly the difficulty of combining models with different architectures and trained under slightly different conditions (Challenges 1 and 2). Efficiently merging diverse pre-trained models without full retraining has substantial practical implications for resource saving and building more capable composite systems. Success would represent a major advancement in model reuse. Furthermore, the research has scientific significance by providing a framework to study how task conditions influence representation alignment across architectures, potentially offering empirical insights related to concepts like the Canonical Representation Hypothesis (CRH) and contributing to a deeper understanding of representation learning."
