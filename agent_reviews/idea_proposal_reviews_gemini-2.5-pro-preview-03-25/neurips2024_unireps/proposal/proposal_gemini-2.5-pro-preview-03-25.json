        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core question of the workshop ('When, how and why do different neural models learn the same representations?') by proposing a method (TCFA) focused on functional alignment conditioned on tasks, rather than parameter-space identity. It perfectly elaborates the research idea, detailing the motivation, mechanism (activation alignment, task conditioning, OT/CCA, stitching layers), and goals. The proposal effectively integrates concepts from the cited literature (stitching, canonical representations, alignment challenges) and explicitly aims to tackle the identified key challenges, particularly architectural disparities and functional alignment complexity. The connection between the proposed method and the workshop's goal of understanding and unifying representations is clear and strong."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Problem, Objectives, Methodology, Outcomes). The core concept of Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment (TCFA) is explained effectively, differentiating it from parameter-space methods. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The methodology section provides a detailed step-by-step description of the proposed algorithm (including layer selection, task conditioning, activation extraction, alignment learning via OT/CCA options, and transformation parameterization), model merging procedure, and a comprehensive evaluation plan with baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The language is precise and technical without being overly obscure."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While concepts like activation space alignment, stitching, CCA, and OT have been explored individually in representation analysis or transfer learning, the core idea of *explicitly conditioning* the functional alignment on specific task properties (e.g., classes, transformations) to enable the *merging of heterogeneous architectures* appears novel. It moves beyond parameter-space merging (like averaging or Git Re-Basin) and simple activation matching by hypothesizing that task-relevant functional structures are the key to alignment across diverse models. This task-conditioned approach offers a fresh perspective compared to existing merging techniques and directly addresses a key limitation (architectural heterogeneity). It builds upon, rather than replicates, the ideas in the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the observation of functional similarities in neural networks (workshop theme, Ziyin et al.) and leverages established mathematical techniques (Optimal Transport, Canonical Correlation Analysis) for alignment. The central hypothesis – that task-conditioned activation spaces can be aligned via learnable transformations for effective merging – is plausible. The proposed methodology, including the TCFA algorithm steps and the comprehensive evaluation plan (baselines, metrics, ablations), is technically sound and demonstrates rigor. Minor weaknesses include the high-level description of the specific OT/CCA objective functions for simultaneous alignment across conditions and the precise derivation/parameterization of the transformation T, which would require further refinement during implementation, but this is acceptable for a proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It plans to use publicly available datasets and pre-trained models, significantly reducing overhead. The core technical components (implementing OT/CCA on activations, handling different model architectures, training small stitch layers) are achievable with standard machine learning frameworks and expertise. The empirical evaluation plan, while extensive, follows standard practices in ML research and seems manageable within a typical research project timeline. The main risk lies in the core hypothesis – whether sufficient functional alignment exists and can be effectively captured across highly diverse architectures using the proposed methods. However, the plan includes ablations to investigate these limitations, making the overall approach practical and implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Practically, it addresses the critical challenge of merging pre-trained models with different architectures, which could lead to substantial savings in computational resources and energy, democratizing access to powerful AI and enabling novel model combinations. Theoretically, it directly contributes to the workshop's central theme by providing an empirical framework to investigate *when* and *how* functional representations align under specific task conditions, offering insights into representation learning, invariance, and the potential emergence of canonical computations across diverse systems (as discussed by Ziyin et al., Lehalleur et al.). Success would represent a major advancement in model reuse and our understanding of learned representations."
