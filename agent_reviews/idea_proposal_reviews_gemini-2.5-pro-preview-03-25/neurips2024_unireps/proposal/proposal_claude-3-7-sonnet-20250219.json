        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of understanding and unifying representations across different models by proposing a specific mechanism (TCFA) for merging. It thoroughly elaborates on the initial research idea, providing a detailed methodology. Furthermore, it explicitly references concepts from the literature review (CRH, stitching) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified (architectural disparities, task variability, functional alignment complexity, efficiency, generalization). The objectives and significance strongly resonate with the goals outlined in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure, starting with background and motivation, clearly stating objectives, detailing the methodology with specific algorithms, outlining the experimental design, and discussing expected outcomes and impact. Key concepts like TCFA, probing, mapping, alignment, and stitching are explained. The algorithms provide a good overview of the proposed steps. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise implementation details of some steps (e.g., exact OT formulation for transformation, selection of hyperparameters like theta, lambda, gamma, specifics of non-linear network architecture), but the overall research plan and rationale are understandable and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing concepts like representation alignment (CKA, CCA, OT) and model merging/stitching, the core idea of *task-conditioned* functional alignment specifically for *cross-architecture* merging appears novel. Conditioning the alignment process on task-specific stimuli to identify functional equivalence, rather than relying solely on general representational similarity or parameter matching, is a distinct approach. The proposed multi-stage methodology (probing, mapping, transformation learning, stitching) tailored for this purpose represents a fresh perspective on tackling the challenges of merging heterogeneous models."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in recent literature on representation learning and alignment. The methodology leverages established techniques like CKA for similarity measurement, bipartite matching for mapping, and CCA/OT for linear alignment, applying them logically to the problem. The proposal acknowledges the need for non-linear transformations and suggests a reasonable approach (learning small NNs). The experimental design is comprehensive. While the core assumption that effective functional alignment is achievable via these methods needs empirical validation, and some minor technical details (e.g., precise OT transformation calculation) could be slightly refined, the overall technical approach is well-justified and theoretically plausible."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and standard ML resources (pre-trained models, datasets, compute for analysis and training). The techniques proposed (CKA, CCA, OT, NN training) are standard. However, the multi-stage pipeline (probing across conditions, mapping, learning potentially complex transformations, stitching, fine-tuning) presents significant implementation complexity. Successfully aligning models across very different architectures and tasks might prove challenging, and the effectiveness of relatively simple transformations is not guaranteed. Managing the extensive experimental plan requires substantial engineering effort. Therefore, while feasible, it requires considerable effort and carries moderate technical risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of computational cost and resource constraints associated with training large-scale AI models. Enabling effective cross-architecture model merging would offer substantial benefits: reduced training costs, lower environmental impact (sustainable AI), democratization of access to powerful models, and new possibilities for model composition. Furthermore, the research promises to advance the fundamental understanding of representation learning, functional similarity across diverse neural systems, and the principles governing knowledge transfer, aligning perfectly with the workshop's theme and broader goals in AI research."
