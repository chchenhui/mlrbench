        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's theme of unifying representations in neural models. It directly addresses the 'how' (spectral alignment via shared invariant subspaces), 'why' (emergence of similar representations, practical needs like model reuse), and 'practical applications' (model stitching, merging, transfer learning) mentioned in the task description. It proposes a concrete method to study and enforce representational similarity, fitting perfectly with the workshop's objective to discuss theoretical findings, empirical evidence, and practical applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-defined, the core technical proposal (spectral analysis of activation covariance, dual objective training) is clearly articulated, and the validation strategy (stitching vision/language models) is specific. The expected outcomes, covering both theoretical insights and practical tools, are explicitly listed, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the research direction and goals."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While representation alignment itself is an active field, the specific approach of using spectral analysis (eigenvectors of covariance) within a dual training objective to explicitly identify and align *shared invariant subspaces* across potentially heterogeneous models (vision/language) offers a fresh perspective. Focusing on invariant subspaces rather than just general similarity, and aiming for zero-shot stitching based on this alignment, represents a notable innovation over standard fine-tuning or simpler alignment techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research appears largely feasible. Calculating covariance matrices and their eigenvectors for activations is computationally tractable. Implementing a dual-objective loss function is standard in deep learning. Pre-trained models for vision and language are widely available. The main challenge lies in empirically demonstrating that aligning top eigenvectors effectively captures functionally relevant shared subspaces and enables high-performance model stitching without cross-modal data, but the core methodology relies on established techniques, making implementation practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds excellent significance. Successfully identifying and aligning shared invariant subspaces could provide fundamental insights into the geometry of neural representations and the principles governing emergent similarities. Practically, it promises powerful tools for model compositionality, zero-shot model merging, and cross-architecture transfer, potentially reducing the need for extensive task-specific data and fine-tuning. Achieving effective model stitching without cross-modal data would be a major advancement with high impact."
