        "justification": "The idea directly addresses the practical application aspect of the workshop task, focusing on unifying representations for model merging, stitching, and reuse through alignment. It also touches upon identifying invariances. However, it primarily focuses on *enforcing* similarity via alignment rather than deeply investigating the *reasons* (when, how, why) representations naturally become similar across models, which is a core theoretical question posed by the workshop. It also lacks an explicit connection to the cross-pollination aspect with neuroscience or cognitive science mentioned in the task.",

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation, the main technical approach (contrastive learning for alignment across diverse models), the key innovation (alignment module, invariance focus), and the validation strategy (stitching, transfer learning). The expected outcomes and impact are also articulated concisely. Minor details about the specific alignment module or multi-task objectives could be elaborated, but the core concept is immediately understandable.",

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While representation alignment and contrastive learning are established fields, the specific focus on aligning representations across *diverse architectures* (CNNs, Transformers) into a *unified* space using contrastive learning combined with explicit *invariant learning* objectives (via augmentations and multi-tasking) offers a fresh perspective. It's not groundbreaking, as related techniques exist, but the proposed combination and specific application target represent a notable contribution beyond standard practice.",

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It leverages well-established techniques like contrastive learning, CNNs, Transformers, data augmentation, and multi-task learning. Standard benchmark datasets can be used for validation. Implementation is practical with current ML hardware and software libraries. Potential challenges include optimizing the contrastive alignment across very different model types and ensuring the learned invariances are meaningful and robust, but these seem like solvable research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks.",

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully aligning representations across diverse models would address major challenges in model interoperability, reuse, merging, and efficient deployment (reducing redundant training). This has direct implications for practical applications like federated learning, multi-modal AI, and building more modular and collaborative AI systems. It directly tackles a key practical problem highlighted in the workshop description.",
