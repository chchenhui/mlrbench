        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the goal of bridging ML and genomics for drug discovery, focusing on target identification via perturbation screens. It explicitly incorporates multiple topics listed in the Main Track call for papers, including 'Perturbation biology', 'Integrating multimodal perturbation readouts', 'Active learning in genomics', 'Uncertainty quantification', 'Optimal transport', 'Experimental design for Biology', and 'Graph neural network'. The application domain (single-cell multi-omics) is also explicitly mentioned as relevant in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is very clearly articulated. The motivation is well-defined (reducing experimental cost in complex perturbation screens). The main technical components (heterogeneous GNN, Bayesian uncertainty, active learning, optimal transport, multi-modal data, in silico/vitro loop) are specified, and the expected outcomes are concrete (quantitative reduction in experiments, qualitative discovery). While specific algorithmic details are omitted (as expected in a summary), the overall concept, workflow, and goals are crystal clear and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced ML concepts (Bayesian GNNs, active learning, optimal transport) in a novel configuration to tackle a specific, challenging problem: multi-modal active experimental design for single-cell perturbation screens. While individual components exist in prior work (e.g., GNNs for genomics, active learning, OT for modality alignment), their synergistic combination within a graph-driven framework for guiding perturbation experiments represents a fresh and innovative approach in the field."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It relies on complex techniques (Bayesian GNNs, optimal transport) which can be computationally demanding, especially at scale. Access to rich, multi-modal single-cell perturbation data is crucial, which can be expensive to generate. The proposed validation requires both in silico modeling and in vitro experiments (CRISPR screens), demanding substantial resources and potentially cross-disciplinary collaboration. While technically achievable with current methods, the resource requirements (compute, data, wet-lab) make it ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and potential impact. It addresses a critical bottleneck in functional genomics and drug discovery â€“ the inefficiency and high cost of large-scale perturbation screens. Successfully reducing the experimental burden by 40-60% while improving the discovery of causal gene networks would be a major advancement. The development of a generalizable pipeline for active, multi-modal experimental design could broadly benefit the field, accelerating target identification and mechanistic understanding."
