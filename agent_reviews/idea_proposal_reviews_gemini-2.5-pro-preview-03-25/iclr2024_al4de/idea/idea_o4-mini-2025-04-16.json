        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core goal of the workshop: using AI to enhance the efficiency of solving PDEs ('order-of-magnitude speedups', 'reducing overall parameter count'). It focuses on novel deep learning techniques (adaptive MoE neural operator) for scientific simulations (climate, fluid dynamics), explicitly mentioning target application areas listed in the task description. Furthermore, it touches upon interpretability ('interpretability through explicit region assignments'), another key topic mentioned."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (MoE, uncertainty estimation, adaptive refinement), and expected outcomes are well-described. The alternating training process is outlined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details (e.g., exact gating mechanism, specific UQ method implementation details, handling of expert initialization/transfer learning during refinement), but the overall concept is readily understandable and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality and innovation. While individual components like neural operators, MoE, uncertainty quantification, and adaptive refinement exist, their specific synthesis within a hierarchical framework where uncertainty explicitly guides the adaptive partitioning and expert refinement for neural operators appears novel. It offers a fresh perspective on building efficient and adaptive surrogate models for PDEs, moving beyond standard fixed-architecture operators."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Neural operators, MoE architectures, and uncertainty estimation techniques (like ensembles or Bayesian layers) are established. However, implementing the dynamic, uncertainty-guided adaptive refinement loop presents non-trivial engineering challenges. Managing the hierarchical structure, training stability, efficient data handling for patches, and integrating the UQ feedback loop requires careful design and implementation effort. Training such a complex system might also be computationally intensive."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current neural operators â€“ their inefficiency in handling localized phenomena requiring non-uniform resolution. Achieving significant speedups and reduced computational cost for complex PDE simulations (shocks, boundary layers) in fields like climate science and fluid dynamics would be a major advancement. The integration of uncertainty quantification provides built-in error estimation, enhancing reliability, and the adaptive nature directly tackles efficiency, a core goal in SciML."
