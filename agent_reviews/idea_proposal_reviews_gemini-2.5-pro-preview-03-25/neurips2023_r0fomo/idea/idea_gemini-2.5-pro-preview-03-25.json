        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (R0-FoMo workshop). The task explicitly asks for 'automated tools for evaluating robustness that correlate with real use of the models', questions 'What distributional blind-spots do these few-shot learning models have?', and lists 'Automated evaluation of foundation models' and 'Adversarial few-shot or zero-shot robustness' as key topics. The proposed 'Contextualized Adversarial Prompting (CAP)' directly addresses these points by offering an automated method to evaluate robustness specifically tied to the few-shot context (prompts and examples), aiming to uncover vulnerabilities beyond general model weaknesses. It directly tackles the core theme of understanding and evaluating few-shot robustness in foundation models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (limitations of standard attacks, slowness of manual checks). The core concept of CAP – generating adversarial prompts/examples rather than perturbing inputs, using optimization to maximize error based on the few-shot context – is explained concisely and without significant ambiguity. The distinction between context-specific vs. general model vulnerabilities is sharp. The expected outcome and impact are also clearly stated. A minor point could be slightly more detail on the specific optimization methods envisioned, but the overall idea is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial attacks on inputs are standard, and adversarial prompt generation exists (often for jailbreaking/harmful content), this proposal focuses specifically on optimizing prompts *or* few-shot examples to induce *task failure* on clean inputs as a means of evaluating the *robustness conferred by the few-shot context itself*. This specific framing – using adversarial optimization on the context (prompts/examples) to probe task-specific robustness vulnerabilities introduced by few-shot learning – is a novel combination and application of existing techniques. It moves beyond general model robustness or simple prompt injection towards a more nuanced evaluation of context-dependent fragility."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology. Techniques for optimizing prompts using gradient-based methods (if gradients are available) or search/gradient-free optimization (for black-box models) exist and have been demonstrated (e.g., in prompt generation/jailbreaking). Defining an objective function based on prediction error is straightforward. The main challenges are computational cost (searching the space of prompts/examples can be expensive) and the effectiveness of the optimization in finding meaningful, non-trivial vulnerabilities. Access constraints (black-box vs. white-box) might limit the choice of optimization methods, but the proposal acknowledges both gradient-based and search methods, suggesting flexibility. Overall, it's technically plausible, though potentially resource-intensive."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. As foundation models are increasingly deployed via few-shot learning (in-context learning, prompting), understanding the robustness implications of the specific prompts and examples used is critical for safety and reliability. Standard evaluations often miss these context-specific failure modes. Developing an automated tool (CAP) to identify brittle prompt/example combinations addresses a crucial gap identified in the task description. Such a tool would enable targeted improvements in prompt design, example selection, and model fine-tuning, leading to more robust and trustworthy AI systems. It directly contributes to the 'Responsible AI' and 'Automated evaluation' themes of the workshop."
