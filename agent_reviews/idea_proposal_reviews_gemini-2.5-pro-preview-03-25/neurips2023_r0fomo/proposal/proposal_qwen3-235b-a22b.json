    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of few-shot robustness in foundation models, specifically focusing on adversarial robustness via prompt manipulation, a key topic mentioned in the task description (R0-FoMo workshop goals) and the research idea. The methodology leverages meta-learning and adversarial training, repurposing concepts discussed in the task description and literature review for the specific context of few-shot prompt robustness. It acknowledges and aims to overcome challenges highlighted in the literature, such as data scarcity for adversarial training in few-shot settings. The proposed experiments and expected outcomes (e.g., automated evaluation tools, responsible AI contributions) also map well onto the workshop's themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically. The core idea of Meta-APP and the three stages of the methodology are easy to understand. Algorithmic details are provided with equations. The experimental design is well-specified. Minor areas for improvement include slightly clarifying the parameters being updated in the meta-update step (Eq. under 2.2.2 - clarifying if theta refers to foundation model or APG parameters being updated in that specific step) to remove any ambiguity. Overall, the proposal is well-written and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial training, meta-learning, and prompt tuning/perturbation exist individually (as shown in the literature review), the specific combination of using meta-learning to generate *universal, task-agnostic adversarial prompt perturbations* during pretraining for enhancing *few-shot* robustness appears novel. It distinguishes itself from standard adversarial training (requires large data), input perturbation methods, and existing adversarial prompt tuning (e.g., White et al., 2023, which is cited as a baseline and likely focuses on task-specific tuning). The novelty lies in the meta-learned universality of prompt perturbations aimed specifically at the few-shot setting."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established principles of adversarial training (KL divergence maximization), meta-learning (MAML-like optimization structure), and foundation model training. The proposed methodology, including the Adversarial Prompt Generator (APG) and the robust training objective, is technically plausible. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant datasets, strong baselines, diverse attack scenarios, and appropriate metrics. The use of Frobenius norm for prompt perturbations is standard for continuous embeddings but might warrant brief justification depending on the exact prompt representation. The technical formulations are generally correct, though the minor ambiguity noted under Clarity exists."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires access to large foundation models, pretraining capabilities, and significant computational resources (4xA100 GPUs mentioned), which is standard but demanding. The meta-learning component adds complexity over standard training, potentially increasing training time (acknowledged) and requiring careful hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rates, epsilon, beta). Stability during adversarial meta-learning can also be a concern. However, the core techniques are established, and the plan includes mitigation strategies (e.g., freezing FM). It is feasible within a well-equipped research setting."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of robustness in few-shot learning settings for foundation models, which hinders their deployment in safety-critical applications. Improving robustness against adversarial prompt manipulations is crucial. The potential impact is substantial, offering a pathway to more reliable few-shot models, contributing valuable public benchmarks and evaluation tools (aligning with workshop goals), and providing insights into prompt vulnerabilities. A successful outcome, particularly the projected 15-20% AUROC improvement, would be a major advancement for responsible AI and the practical use of foundation models."
