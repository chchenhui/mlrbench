        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses both major themes proposed for the AI4Mat-ICLR-2025 workshop: 'How Do We Build a Foundation Model for Materials Science?' and 'What are Next-Generation Representations of Materials Data?'. The focus on integrating multi-modal data using a foundational model approach fits squarely within the workshop's scope and goals of tackling cutting-edge challenges in AI-driven materials discovery."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main idea (broken down into three logical steps: preprocessing, representation learning, evaluation), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and are immediately understandable. The use of specific techniques like transformers is mentioned, adding to the clarity. Minor details on specific data modalities or preprocessing algorithms could be added, but the core concept is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea exhibits good originality. While the concept of foundation models is borrowed from other domains (NLP, Vision) and applying AI to materials science is established, the specific focus on creating a *unified foundational model* designed explicitly for *multi-modal* materials data integration (structural, chemical, physical properties) offers notable innovation. It combines recent advancements in representation learning (transformers) with the specific challenges of heterogeneous materials data, pushing beyond single-modality models. It represents a novel synthesis and application rather than a completely new technique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Acquiring, cleaning, and aligning diverse, multi-modal materials datasets at scale is notoriously difficult. Training large foundation models like transformers requires substantial computational resources (GPUs/TPUs). Developing robust evaluation metrics that capture real-world materials science relevance necessitates deep collaboration with domain experts. While the underlying technologies exist, the practical hurdles related to data and computation make implementation demanding, requiring considerable effort and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully developing a foundational model for multi-modal materials data would address a critical bottleneck in the field, potentially unifying disparate modeling efforts. It could dramatically accelerate AI-driven materials discovery by providing powerful, generalizable representations applicable across various material types and properties. This aligns perfectly with the goal of achieving tangible real-world impact in materials science, potentially leading to major advancements."
