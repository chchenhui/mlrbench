        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It proposes a self-explainable model (ante-hoc interpretability), a key topic mentioned. It directly targets knowledge discovery ('unveil structureâ€“activity relationships', 'discover new catalytic mechanisms') within one of the specified scientific application areas (material science). The goal of moving beyond black-box models to aid human knowledge enrichment is central to both the idea and the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation, the proposed model architecture (CatalystXplain with its three components), the training methodology (multi-task learning, combined loss), and the validation strategy (benchmarks, rule extraction, experimental testing). The expected outcomes are also explicitly stated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While self-explainable models and GNNs for materials exist, the specific combination of node/edge attention, a dedicated symbolic rule-extraction module translating subgraphs into chemoinformatic rules, and a multi-task objective explicitly aligning prediction and explanation for catalyst mechanism discovery is innovative. It moves beyond simple attention maps towards generating structured, human-readable scientific hypotheses (rules) directly from the model, tailored for catalysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. GNNs, attention mechanisms, and multi-task learning are standard techniques. Benchmark catalyst datasets are often available. The main challenge lies in developing and effectively training the symbolic rule-extraction module to produce chemically meaningful and faithful rules from complex GNN representations. This integration requires careful design and implementation. Experimental validation requires collaboration and resources but is a common component of ML4Science projects. Overall, it's achievable but requires significant technical expertise and potentially interdisciplinary collaboration."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Overcoming the black-box nature of ML models in catalysis is a critical challenge in material science. Providing interpretable models that reveal structure-activity relationships and suggest mechanisms could drastically accelerate the discovery of new, efficient catalysts, which has substantial economic and environmental implications. It directly addresses the workshop's aim of using XAI for scientific knowledge discovery in a high-impact domain."
