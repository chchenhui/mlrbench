        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'XAI4Science' by focusing on using explainable AI (specifically self-explainable models) for scientific knowledge discovery in healthcare. It explicitly targets 'A-priori (i.e., ante-hoc) interpretability and self-explainable models' and 'Practical use of interpretability and explainability for knowledge discovery in Healthcare', which are listed topics. The goal of uncovering novel biological mechanisms and therapeutic targets directly supports the workshop's aim to 'aid human knowledge and help us to further enrich it'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main concept (knowledge-guided self-explainable models using GNNs/additive models with integrated ontologies), methodology (attention mechanisms, expert validation), and expected outcomes (predictive performance + actionable insights) are articulated concisely and logically. There is minimal ambiguity. Minor details, such as the precise mechanism for integrating ontologies or the specifics of the hybrid evaluation framework, could be further elaborated, but the core proposal is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While components like knowledge-guided ML, GNNs in biomedicine, and self-explainable models exist individually, the proposed synthesis is innovative. Specifically, the focus on building *self-explainable* models by deeply integrating structured biomedical knowledge (ontologies, pathways) into the model architecture (GNNs, additive models) for the explicit purpose of *generating novel, actionable scientific insights* (not just predictions or post-hoc explanations) offers a fresh perspective. The planned validation loop involving domain experts and experimental validation further distinguishes it from purely computational XAI work. It's a novel combination aimed directly at scientific discovery through inherent model interpretability."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The machine learning components (GNNs, additive models, attention) are standard, and integrating knowledge graphs is technically feasible, although complex. Accessing and integrating diverse biomedical data (ontologies, interaction networks, clinical data) requires significant effort and expertise. The main challenge lies in the proposed validation loop: 'wet-lab experiments or clinical trials' are extremely resource-intensive, time-consuming, and depend heavily on successful interdisciplinary collaboration. While computational validation of insights against known biology is feasible, the full experimental validation significantly impacts overall feasibility. The core ML research is feasible, but realizing the full vision including experimental validation requires substantial resources and partnerships."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses two critical problems: the lack of trust and transparency in complex AI models used in high-stakes domains like healthcare, and the need for new computational tools to accelerate biomedical discovery. Success could lead to more reliable AI-driven diagnostic/prognostic tools, the discovery of novel biomarkers or drug targets, and a deeper mechanistic understanding of diseases. This directly contributes to advancing precision medicine and establishes a framework for AI as a collaborative partner in scientific research, potentially impacting other scientific fields as well."
