    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'A-posteriori (i.e., post-hoc) interpretability and attribution methods' and their 'Practical use... for knowledge discovery in Weather and climate science'. The motivation aligns with using ML/XAI to understand complex models and solve societal problems (climate change), which is central to the workshop's theme."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (interpretability of climate models), the main approach (using a-posteriori XAI like LIME/SHAP), the methodology (applying these algorithms), expected outcomes (interpretable models, better understanding), and potential impact (trust, policy). The language is concise and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Applying established XAI techniques like LIME and SHAP to scientific models, including climate models, is an active area but not fundamentally new. The core contribution seems to be the application and potential insights within the climate domain, rather than proposing novel XAI methodologies. It combines existing concepts in a relevant way but lacks groundbreaking originality."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. LIME and SHAP are existing, usable techniques. Climate models, while complex and computationally intensive, are available. Potential challenges include the computational cost of applying XAI to large-scale climate simulations, accessing appropriate model outputs, and requiring interdisciplinary expertise (climate science + ML/XAI). However, these are surmountable challenges with adequate resources and collaboration."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Climate change is a critical global challenge, and improving the understanding, trustworthiness, and interpretability of climate models has major potential impacts on scientific progress, policy-making, and public acceptance. Addressing model complexity and fostering trust directly tackles important issues in the field, aligning with the goal of using ML for societal benefit."
