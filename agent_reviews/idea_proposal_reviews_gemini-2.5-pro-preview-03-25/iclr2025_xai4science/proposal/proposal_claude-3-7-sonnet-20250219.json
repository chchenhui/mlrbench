    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of using XAI (specifically ante-hoc/self-explainable models) for scientific discovery in healthcare. It thoroughly elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the knowledge integration, model architecture, and validation strategy. Furthermore, it positions itself effectively within the provided literature, acknowledging prior work on interpretable GNNs and knowledge integration while proposing advancements to tackle the identified challenges like balancing performance/interpretability and validating insights."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a strong motivation and clear objectives, followed by a detailed methodology, and concluding with expected outcomes and impact. Key concepts like the BGNN architecture, knowledge integration strategy, and multi-objective loss function are explained well, including mathematical formulations. The experimental design and validation plan are explicitly laid out. While highly technical, the proposal is immediately understandable to an expert in the field with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing work in interpretable GNNs and knowledge integration (as cited in the literature review), it proposes a novel synthesis: the specific Bio-Guided Neural Network (BGNN) architecture combining knowledge-guided embeddings, a knowledge-structured GNN, and an interpretable GAM layer. The integration of diverse knowledge sources (networks, ontologies, pharmacology, guidelines) and the tailored multi-objective loss function with biologically-motivated regularization terms add to the novelty. The strong focus on generating testable scientific hypotheses and validating them experimentally distinguishes it from purely predictive or post-hoc explanation approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established ML techniques (GNNs, attention, GAMs, multi-objective optimization) and leverages standard biomedical knowledge resources. The proposed BGNN architecture is conceptually coherent, and the mathematical formulations for the GNN layers and loss functions appear correct. The methodology for knowledge integration and the multi-objective training strategy are well-justified. The comprehensive validation plan, including benchmarking, ablation studies, and expert/experimental validation, adds significantly to the rigor. Minor weaknesses include the potential complexity of tuning the multi-objective loss and the inherent challenge of ensuring attention mechanisms truly reflect causal biological importance, but the overall approach is technically solid."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The computational aspects (implementing BGNN using PyTorch/DGL, training on large datasets) are achievable with appropriate expertise and resources. Accessing and integrating diverse, large-scale biomedical data (especially EHR data) can be complex and time-consuming. The most significant feasibility challenge lies in the planned experimental validation, which requires securing collaboration with wet labs, significant time, and resources, introducing external dependencies and uncertainty. While the core ML research is feasible, completing the full validation pipeline as described is ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical need for trustworthy and interpretable AI in healthcare, moving beyond black-box predictions towards models that can contribute to scientific discovery. Successfully developing knowledge-guided self-explainable models could accelerate drug discovery, improve personalized medicine, enhance clinical trust in AI, and generate novel biological insights. The potential to create AI systems that act as collaborative tools for scientists addresses a major gap and aligns perfectly with the goals of advancing both AI methodology and biomedical understanding."
