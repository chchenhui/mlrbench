        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core focus on spurious correlations and shortcut learning by proposing a novel solution ('robustification method'). Specifically, it targets the objective of creating methods that work when information about spurious features is unknown, using an automated detection approach (unsupervised clustering) and counterfactual generation. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's call for 'novel solutions for building robust models' and 'Finding solutions for robustness to spurious correlation when information regarding spurious feature is completely or partially unknown'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the proposed framework involving unsupervised clustering, causal GANs for counterfactual generation, and iterative self-evaluation is logically presented. The overall goal of mitigating shortcuts without manual annotation is understandable. However, some technical details lack precision, such as the specific unsupervised clustering method, the exact mechanism for enforcing 'causal constraints' in the GAN, and the details of the 'self-evaluation mechanism'. Minor refinements clarifying these aspects would improve precision."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like data augmentation, GANs, counterfactual reasoning, and clustering exist, their proposed integration into an automated framework for mitigating shortcut learning without prior knowledge of spurious features is innovative. The combination of unsupervised detection of potential spurious features from latent spaces and targeted counterfactual generation using causal constraints within a GAN offers a fresh perspective compared to methods relying on group labels or predefined attributes. The iterative self-evaluation loop further adds to the novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Automatically and reliably identifying spurious features solely through unsupervised clustering on latent representations is non-trivial; clusters might not perfectly correspond to spurious attributes. Generating high-quality counterfactuals that precisely manipulate only the intended spurious features while preserving all causal ones using a causally constrained GAN is technically demanding and an active area of research. Ensuring the stability and convergence of the iterative process adds complexity. While the building blocks exist, successful implementation requires overcoming substantial technical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Shortcut learning is a critical barrier to deploying robust and reliable deep learning models. Developing an automated method that mitigates this issue without requiring manual annotation of spurious features would be a major advancement. Success would improve model generalization, fairness (by reducing reliance on correlations that harm underrepresented groups), and trustworthiness, addressing a fundamental problem highlighted in the workshop description. The potential impact on the field is substantial."
