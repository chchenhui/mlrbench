        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop call). It directly addresses the need for 'novel solutions for building robust models' specifically targeting 'Foundation Models (LLMs/LMMs)' and the critical challenge of robustness when 'information regarding spurious feature is completely or partially unknown'. The proposed 'probe-and-correct' framework aims to enhance robustness against 'unknown spurious correlations', which is highlighted as a key objective and topic of interest in the workshop description, moving beyond benchmarks that rely on known group labels."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The core 'probe-and-correct' framework is understandable, and the steps involved (using explanations, hypothesizing shortcuts, generating counterfactuals, fine-tuning) are logically laid out. Mentioning specific techniques like influence functions adds concreteness. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of 'automatically cluster these influential features' and the precise formulation of the 'targeted regularization term or contrastive loss', but the overall concept and goal are well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like post-hoc explanations, counterfactual generation, and robust fine-tuning exist, their integration into an iterative framework specifically designed to *proactively discover and mitigate unknown* spurious correlations in foundation models is innovative. It moves beyond reactive approaches that require pre-defined spurious attributes or group labels, offering a fresh perspective on automated robustness enhancement against unforeseen biases."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Applying post-hoc explanation methods (like influence functions) iteratively on large foundation models is computationally very expensive. The step of 'automatically cluster[ing]' influential features to reliably 'hypothesize potential shortcuts' without human intervention is algorithmically challenging and may require substantial research. Generating high-quality, minimally modified counterfactuals automatically is also non-trivial. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation requires overcoming considerable computational and algorithmic hurdles, making it satisfactorily feasible rather than straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Foundation models are increasingly pervasive, and their susceptibility to spurious correlations (especially unknown ones) is a major barrier to reliable and trustworthy deployment. Successfully developing a method to proactively robustify these models without needing prior knowledge of specific spurious attributes would be a major advancement. It directly addresses a critical problem highlighted by the workshop, potentially leading to more generalizable and safer AI systems."
