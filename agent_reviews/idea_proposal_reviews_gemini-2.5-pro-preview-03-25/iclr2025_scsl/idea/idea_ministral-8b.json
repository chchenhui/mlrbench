        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's call for 'automated methods for detecting spurious correlations', explicitly mentioned as a key objective. The focus on multimodal data is listed as a specific topic of interest. Furthermore, the proposal aims to create new benchmarks and datasets for evaluating robustness in multimodal models, another key objective highlighted in the workshop description. The motivation regarding robustness, reliability, and fairness mirrors the workshop's core concerns."

        "justification": "The idea is partially clear but has some ambiguities. The overall goal (automated detection framework for spurious correlations in multimodal data) and the general steps (preprocessing, feature extraction, contrastive learning, detection, evaluation) are understandable. However, the core component, the 'novel algorithm to detect spurious correlations by comparing the learned representations against known spurious patterns,' lacks detail. It's unclear how this comparison works, what constitutes 'known spurious patterns' in an automated detection context, and how this aligns with detecting potentially *unknown* correlations mentioned as a challenge in the workshop description. The specific role of contrastive learning representations in the *detection* step, beyond just being robust, needs further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea has notable originality. While detecting spurious correlations and using contrastive learning are active research areas, the specific focus on developing an *automated framework* for this purpose within the *multimodal* domain using these techniques offers good novelty. Creating new multimodal benchmarks specifically for spurious correlation detection is also a valuable and novel contribution highlighted as needed by the workshop. The novelty level depends somewhat on the specifics of the proposed detection algorithm; if it moves beyond simple comparisons to predefined 'known patterns' towards identifying inconsistencies or unexpected correlations automatically, the novelty increases."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Components like multimodal feature extraction and contrastive learning leverage existing, albeit computationally intensive, techniques. Data preprocessing is standard. However, the core research task, developing a 'novel algorithm' for automated detection, carries inherent uncertainty. The feasibility heavily depends on the specifics and success of this algorithm development. Defining and validating 'spuriousness' automatically, especially for unknown correlations in complex multimodal data, is non-trivial. Access to suitable large-scale multimodal datasets and significant computational resources would be required. Creating new benchmarks is feasible but resource-intensive."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical and timely problem of spurious correlations, which undermines AI reliability and fairness, as emphasized by the workshop. Focusing on multimodal data addresses an increasingly important and complex domain. An automated detection framework would be a major advancement over manual or limited-scope methods, potentially enabling the development of more robust and trustworthy AI systems across various applications (healthcare, social media, etc.). The proposed creation of new benchmarks would also be a significant contribution to the research community."
