    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly consistent with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of spurious correlations and the need for robustification methods that work without group labels, a key focus of the workshop task description. The methodology elaborates precisely on the AIFS research idea (adaptive latent intervention, label-free). It effectively positions AIFS within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging related work (e.g., Group DRO, feature reweighting, SPUME, ULE) and challenges (identifying unknown spurious features). The objectives and significance align perfectly with the workshop's goals of finding novel solutions and understanding foundations. The only minor point is that while foundation models are mentioned as a potential application area (aligning with workshop topics), the proposed experiments focus on standard benchmarks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes), and the core concepts of AIFS, latent intervention, adaptive masking, and the dual-objective loss are explained well. The research objectives are clearly stated and measurable. The methodology section provides good detail, including algorithmic pseudo-code and a clear experimental plan. Minor areas for potential refinement include slightly more concrete details on the primary proposed method for sensitivity calculation (as alternatives are mentioned) and the practical approximation of the expectation involved. However, the overall proposal is readily understandable and articulates the research plan effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. The core idea of using *adaptively* guided synthetic interventions in the *latent space*, based on sensitivity analysis, to mitigate *unknown* spurious correlations *without group labels* appears novel. While individual components (latent space manipulation, invariance principles, sensitivity analysis) exist, their specific combination and application for this purpose are distinct from existing methods outlined in the literature review (e.g., Group DRO, post-hoc retraining, VLM-based attribute extraction like SPUME, teacher-student like ULE). The proposal clearly articulates this distinction and the gap it aims to fill. It's not entirely groundbreaking but offers a fresh perspective and a new combination of techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on established concepts like invariance and sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology (encoder, intervention, dual loss, adaptive mask) is logically structured, and the technical formulations for the intervention and loss are clear and standard. The use of gradient-based sensitivity is a plausible approach. However, the core assumption – that sensitivity to the proposed synthetic latent interventions reliably identifies dimensions corresponding to real-world spurious correlations – requires strong empirical validation. The effectiveness might depend heavily on the type and strength of intervention, and the stability of the adaptive feedback loop needs investigation. While generally well-founded, this central assumption introduces a degree of uncertainty regarding the guaranteed success, preventing a higher score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard deep learning techniques and publicly available benchmark datasets. The required computational resources (GPUs) are standard for this type of research. The core components of AIFS (latent intervention, gradient computation for sensitivity, mask updates) are implementable within existing frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. The main challenges are typical research risks: potential instability of the adaptive mechanism, the need for careful hyperparameter tuning (lambda_inv, sigma, k, update frequency), and ensuring the sensitivity measure is effective. These challenges seem manageable through standard empirical research practices and do not represent fundamental roadblocks to implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and pervasive problem of spurious correlations, a major obstacle to deploying reliable and fair AI systems. The key contribution – a method to mitigate *unknown* spurious correlations *without* group labels – addresses a major practical limitation of many existing techniques and aligns directly with the workshop's objectives. If successful, AIFS could offer a broadly applicable (potentially modality-agnostic) tool for practitioners, improve model robustness in real-world scenarios (especially label-scarce ones), and contribute to a deeper understanding of shortcut learning mechanisms through the analysis of its adaptive process. The potential impact on the field of robust machine learning is substantial."
