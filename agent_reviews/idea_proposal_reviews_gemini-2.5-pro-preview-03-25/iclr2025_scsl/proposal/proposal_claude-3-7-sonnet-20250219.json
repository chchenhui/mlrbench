    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly consistent with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for novel solutions to mitigate spurious correlations, particularly focusing on the challenging scenario where spurious features are unknown and group labels are unavailable, a key objective mentioned in the task description. The methodology elaborates precisely on the core AIFS idea presented. It acknowledges the limitations of existing methods (like reliance on group labels or focusing only on specific layers, mentioned in the intro and literature review) and positions AIFS as a distinct approach. The proposal aligns perfectly with the workshop topics, specifically 'Proposing new robustification methods' and 'Finding solutions for robustness to spurious correlation when information regarding spurious feature is completely or partially unknown'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear and well-structured. The background, problem statement, objectives, and significance are clearly articulated. The AIFS framework is broken down into logical components, and the methodology, including the intervention mechanism, loss functions, and adaptive mask update process, is described with mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps. The experimental design is well-defined with specific datasets, baselines, and metrics. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as a deeper justification for the specific form of the sensitivity loss or more detail on the initialization of the encoder and classifier, but overall the proposal is understandable and logically presented."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While leveraging existing concepts like interventions, invariance principles, and gradient-based attribution, the core novelty lies in their integration into an *adaptive* framework (AIFS) that *automatically* discovers and targets potentially spurious dimensions in the latent space *without* prior knowledge or group labels. The mechanism of using learned, adaptive masks for interventions, guided by internal attribution signals and combined with specific invariance and sensitivity losses, appears distinct from prior work mentioned (e.g., methods requiring group labels like GroupDRO/ElRep, layer-specific methods like Izmailov et al./Hameed et al., or VLM-based methods like SPUME). The proposal clearly articulates this distinction."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, grounded in established principles of representation learning, invariance, and attribution methods. The core idea of perturbing latent dimensions to identify and mitigate reliance on non-robust features is plausible. The mathematical formulations for the losses and intervention mechanism are provided. However, the effectiveness of the adaptive mask update mechanism relies heavily on the assumption that gradient-based attribution accurately identifies dimensions corresponding to spurious correlations and that the update rule leads to stable convergence towards robustness. The specific formulation of the sensitivity loss, while conceptually justified in the text, might require further theoretical analysis or ablation studies to confirm its optimality compared to simpler regularization. The reliance on a pretrained encoder is noted but its impact on the process could be explored further."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible. The methodology uses standard deep learning components and techniques (encoders, classifiers, gradient computation, optimization). The required datasets are mostly standard benchmarks. The computational overhead associated with interventions and periodic attribution analysis is acknowledged but seems manageable, especially since attribution is done periodically on a validation set. Standard ML hardware should suffice. The main challenges, realistically identified, are hyperparameter tuning (loss weights, adaptation parameters) and ensuring the stability of the adaptive learning process, but these are common in ML research and do not render the proposal impractical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and fundamental problem in machine learning â€“ the lack of robustness due to spurious correlations, which hinders reliable and fair AI deployment. Developing a method that can automatically mitigate these correlations *without* requiring explicit supervision (group labels or feature annotations) would be a major advancement. If successful, AIFS could have substantial impact across diverse domains like healthcare, autonomous systems, and NLP, as outlined in the proposal. It directly tackles a key challenge highlighted in the workshop description and the literature review, potentially leading to more trustworthy and generalizable AI models."
