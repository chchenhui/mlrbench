    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for understanding representation geometry, developing training methods for robustness, and exploring modality interactions. The core idea of using geometric alignment (OT, Riemannian geometry) for structural similarity is central to the proposal, directly reflecting the research idea. Furthermore, it effectively positions itself within the provided literature, acknowledging recent work (GRAM, misalignment studies) and explicitly aiming to address identified gaps and challenges like moving beyond instance-level alignment and tackling geometric foundations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context effectively, the objectives are explicitly stated and measurable, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the theoretical framework, the proposed GOTMA method (including specific loss functions), and a comprehensive experimental plan. The rationale behind using geometric alignment is well-articulated. While some technical details regarding approximations (e.g., for GW distance, Riemannian distance) would need further elaboration in a full paper, the overall concept, approach, and evaluation strategy are presented with high clarity and logical structure."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While Optimal Transport and Riemannian geometry are established fields, their combined application to explicitly align the *manifold structures* (beyond instance-level correspondence) of different modalities in a shared embedding space appears novel. The proposed GOTMA framework, incorporating OT-based manifold distance approximations (like Gromov-Wasserstein) and Riemannian consistency losses, offers a fresh perspective distinct from existing methods like CLIP (instance-level contrastive), GRAM (Gramian volume), or approaches focusing solely on information theory or implicit alignment. The novelty is clearly articulated."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on solid theoretical foundations in OT and Riemannian geometry. The methodology attempts to formalize geometric alignment using appropriate concepts (GW distance, curvature, local neighborhoods). The proposed loss functions (\\mathcal{L}_{OT}, \\mathcal{L}_{RC}, \\mathcal{L}_{CL}) are mathematically described, and the experimental plan is comprehensive. However, there are minor weaknesses: 1) Potential challenges in accurately and stably computing geometric properties (curvature, Riemannian distance) in high dimensions from empirical data. 2) A slight inconsistency between defining alignment via Gromov-Wasserstein in the theory section and using a standard OT loss (likely approximating GW effects) in the methodology. 3) The curvature alignment metric (\\mathcal{L}_{CA}) is defined theoretically but not included in the final objective function \\mathcal{L}_{total}. These points require minor clarification or justification but do not undermine the overall soundness significantly."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. It relies on standard datasets and specifies appropriate computational resources (A100 GPUs) and libraries (PyTorch, POT). However, implementing and optimizing OT computations (especially GW approximations) can be computationally intensive. Estimating Riemannian properties reliably might require careful numerical methods and approximations. Integrating these components effectively requires significant expertise. The experimental plan is ambitious but well-structured. Overall, it's feasible for a well-equipped research team, but the computational cost and complexity of geometric estimations pose moderate risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and critical problem in multimodal learning: achieving meaningful alignment beyond instance-level matching by considering the geometric structure of modality manifolds. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in representation quality, robustness (to noise, missing modalities), cross-modal transfer, and potentially interpretability. It directly tackles key questions highlighted in the workshop task description regarding representation geometry and training objectives. The potential contributions to both theory and practice of multimodal AI are substantial."
