        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for understanding multimodal representation properties, particularly geometry, and methods to promote useful properties during training. The proposal faithfully elaborates on the research idea, detailing the motivation, core concept (geometric alignment via OT/Riemannian methods), and evaluation strategy. It positions itself well within the provided literature, acknowledging related work on geometric alignment (e.g., GRAM, geometric consistency) and the challenges of misalignment, while proposing specific techniques (OT, Riemannian geometry) to investigate further. It clearly aims to provide systematic insights as requested by the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The research objectives, overall methodology (data, alignment techniques, training, evaluation), and expected outcomes are articulated clearly. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist in the specific implementation details of the Optimal Transport (e.g., cost function) and particularly the Riemannian geometry methods (the formulation \\(\\min_{z} \\|z - z_0\\|_R\\) is abstract and needs better connection to preserving local structure across modalities). Specifying target datasets would also add clarity. However, these points do not significantly obscure the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While the general concept of geometric alignment in multimodal learning exists in the literature (e.g., GRAM, geometric consistency loss, diffusion maps), the specific proposal to investigate Optimal Transport and Riemannian geometry methods explicitly for structural alignment *in conjunction with* standard contrastive losses offers a distinct approach. It moves beyond purely instance-level alignment and proposes specific, less commonly explored techniques for enforcing structural similarity between modality manifolds in the shared space. The novelty lies in this specific combination and application, rather than being entirely groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has weaknesses in technical rigor. The motivation regarding limitations of instance-level alignment is sound. Using Optimal Transport for distribution alignment and combining alignment losses with contrastive losses are established practices. However, the description of the Riemannian geometry component (\\(\\min_{z} \\|z - z_0\\|_R\\)) is vague and potentially technically imprecise regarding how it enforces structural alignment between modalities. It lacks detail on the choice of metric and the specific optimization objective for preserving local structure. The evaluation plan using geometry analysis and downstream tasks is appropriate, but the core methodology requires better technical specification, particularly for the Riemannian part."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Standard multimodal datasets and contrastive learning frameworks are available. Implementing Optimal Transport as a loss is feasible with existing libraries, although potentially computationally intensive. The main feasibility challenge lies in the implementation of the Riemannian geometry methods, which can be complex depending on the chosen approach and require careful implementation. Tuning the combined loss also presents a practical challenge. Overall, the project seems achievable with appropriate expertise and computational resources, but the Riemannian geometry aspect introduces moderate implementation risk and effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the important and timely problem of understanding and improving multimodal representations by focusing on their geometric properties, a key theme highlighted in the task description and recent literature. Successfully demonstrating the benefits of explicit geometric alignment using OT or Riemannian techniques could lead to more robust, semantically meaningful representations, potentially improving performance on various cross-modal tasks. The research would contribute valuable insights into the fundamental nature of multimodal learning and offer practical methods for model improvement."
