    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes, particularly the importance of representation geometry, promoting robustness to missing modalities and noise, and understanding how learning objectives shape representations. The methodology explicitly implements the research idea of combining instance-level contrastive loss with geometric alignment objectives (OT, NN, GRAM). It incorporates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as modality misalignment (explicitly tackled), scalability (plans to test M=3), and evaluation metrics (proposing manifold quality metrics). The objectives, methods, and evaluation plan are all tightly linked to the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes). Research objectives are explicitly listed and unambiguous. The methodology section clearly details the model architecture, data, the mathematical formulation of each proposed loss function (L_con, L_OT, L_NN, L_GRAM), the overall objective, a training pseudocode, and a comprehensive evaluation plan with specific metrics and ablation studies. The language is precise and technical. While minor details like the exact choice of 'k' in L_NN or deeper elaboration on the 'Riemannian-inspired' aspect could be added, the proposal is immediately understandable and leaves little room for ambiguity regarding the core plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like contrastive learning, Optimal Transport, neighborhood preservation concepts, and Gram matrix analysis exist, the novelty lies in their specific combination and application within a single MRL framework. Proposing a composite loss function that simultaneously optimizes for instance-level alignment (L_con) and multiple facets of structural/geometric alignment (L_OT for distributions, L_NN for local neighborhoods, L_GRAM for global volume/structure) is a fresh approach compared to methods focusing on only one type of alignment or relying solely on implicit alignment from contrastive loss. The systematic evaluation of the contribution of each geometric loss term also adds to the novelty. It builds upon recent work (e.g., GRAM) but integrates it into a broader, multi-objective geometric alignment strategy."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid theoretical foundations: contrastive learning (InfoNCE), Optimal Transport, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Gram matrix analysis are all well-established mathematical and computational concepts. The proposed loss functions are clearly formulated mathematically. The methodology, including the encoder architecture, training procedure (mini-batch SGD), and evaluation metrics (standard retrieval/generation metrics, robustness tests, manifold quality metrics), is appropriate and well-justified. The plan includes relevant baselines and ablation studies for rigorous comparison. Minor weaknesses include the potential computational complexity of combining multiple losses (especially OT and kNN) and the challenge of hyperparameter tuning for four loss terms, but the core technical approach is robust and well-defined."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard benchmark datasets (MSCOCO, Flickr30K, VGGSound) and common encoder architectures that can leverage pre-training (e.g., CLIP). The proposed methods (contrastive loss, Sinkhorn for OT, kNN search, Gram matrix computation) have existing efficient implementations and are computationally tractable, especially with mini-batch approximations. While the combination of multiple complex loss terms will require significant computational resources (GPUs) and careful implementation, this is standard for state-of-the-art MRL research. The main risks involve hyperparameter tuning complexity and potential scalability bottlenecks, but these appear manageable within a typical research environment. The plan to release code further supports feasibility and reproducibility."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical challenges in MRL: improving robustness to missing or noisy modalities and understanding/enforcing geometric consistency in the shared latent space, which are known limitations of current methods. Success would lead to more reliable multimodal models for real-world applications. The potential contributions include: 1) improved performance on downstream tasks, 2) enhanced model robustness, 3) deeper insights into the role of geometric alignment, 4) promotion of more comprehensive evaluation protocols (including manifold metrics), and 5) a publicly available library for geometric alignment. The research directly tackles key questions highlighted in the workshop task description, positioning it to make a substantial contribution to the field."
