    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea aligns excellently with the task description (workshop call for papers). It directly addresses several key questions encouraged by the workshop, particularly regarding the geometry of the representation space, the influence of different learning objectives (contrastive vs. graph-based), and promoting robustness to noise and missing modalities. The focus on understanding and improving multimodal representations through geometric priors and specific training objectives fits perfectly within the workshop's scope of exploring properties, training strategies, and interactions in multimodal learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the main components (dual-branch encoder, three specific loss functions) are explicitly stated. The goals of achieving robustness, preserving geometry, and enabling interpretability are clear. The validation strategy is also mentioned. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise formulation of the 'smoothness regularizer', but the core concept is understandable. Overall, the idea is presented with good clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea presents a satisfactory level of novelty. While cross-modal contrastive learning is a standard technique, and graph regularization (using Laplacians) is known in representation learning for single modalities, the specific combination of these elements within a multimodal framework appears less common. Applying modality-specific graph preservation alongside cross-modal contrastive alignment and a smoothness term is a sensible synthesis of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept. It offers a potentially new perspective on balancing alignment and preserving intrinsic structure but doesn't introduce fundamentally new mechanisms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Dual-branch architectures and contrastive losses are standard in multimodal learning. Graph construction (k-NN) and Laplacian computation are well-established techniques, implementable with existing libraries. While building k-NN graphs can be computationally intensive for very large datasets (potentially requiring approximations or efficient implementations), it is generally manageable. The proposed validation on standard benchmarks using perturbation scenarios is practical. Overall, implementation seems achievable with current technology and methods, with potential scalability considerations for the graph component."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds good significance and impact potential. Addressing the brittleness of multimodal representations, especially under noise and missing data, is a critical challenge. Incorporating geometric priors via graph regularization to improve robustness and interpretability tackles important limitations of current methods. If successful, this approach could lead to more reliable and understandable multimodal systems, offering meaningful contributions to the field by providing insights into how modality-specific structure can be preserved during cross-modal alignment."
