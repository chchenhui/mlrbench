        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on understanding multimodal representations, particularly 'insights on interactions across modalities' and 'how can we improve their interactions?'. The core of the idea is to develop a framework specifically for quantifying and analyzing these interactions, directly addressing these key workshop themes. It also touches upon improving downstream task performance, relating to understanding 'what properties are leveraged for downstream tasks?' and 'promoting useful properties'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, overall goal, and the three main components (multi-scale feature extraction, interaction matrix learning, downstream integration) are understandable. However, the specifics of the 'interaction matrix learning algorithm' – how the matrix is defined, what 'strength and nature of interactions' precisely means in this context, and the exact mechanisms of the self-supervised/supervised learning – lack detail, leaving some ambiguity. Minor refinements, particularly regarding the core algorithm, would improve precision."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While analyzing modality interactions and using multi-scale features are not new concepts in themselves, the proposal to create a *systematic multi-scale analysis framework* specifically focused on *quantifying* interactions via a learned 'interaction matrix' offers a novel perspective. Existing methods often focus on fusion or attention mechanisms that implicitly capture interactions, whereas this idea aims for explicit quantification across different scales. The proposed combination of techniques for learning this matrix adds to its novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. Utilizing CNNs for multi-scale feature extraction is standard. Developing a new learning algorithm for the interaction matrix is the main research challenge but seems achievable using established self-supervised and supervised learning paradigms. Evaluating on downstream tasks using standard benchmarks is practical. The required resources (datasets, compute) are typical for current ML research. The implementation seems plausible with existing technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant with clear impact potential. Understanding and quantifying modality interactions is a fundamental challenge in multimodal learning. Addressing the multi-scale nature of these interactions could lead to deeper insights and more robust, better-performing models. Improved understanding and performance in multimodal systems have wide-ranging implications for applications in healthcare, autonomous systems, and multimedia analysis, making this a potentially impactful contribution to the field."
