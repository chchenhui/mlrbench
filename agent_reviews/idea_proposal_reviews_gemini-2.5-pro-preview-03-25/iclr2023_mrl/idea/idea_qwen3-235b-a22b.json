        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (MRL workshop call). It directly addresses several key questions highlighted in the call, specifically: 'How can we quantify the (dis)similarity between modalities?' under the 'Modalities' topic, and 'How do we promote the robustness of the representations to adversarial attacks, missing input modalities, and noise?' under the 'Training' topic. Furthermore, it explores 'insights on interactions across modalities' through the discrepancy score and adaptive fusion mechanism. The focus on understanding modality contributions and improving fusion based on this understanding fits perfectly within the workshop's goal of gaining systematic insights into multimodal representation learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly states the problem of indiscriminate fusion. The main idea is broken down into logical steps: contrastive learning for representation spaces, definition of a 'discrepancy score' (with examples like cosine similarity or OT distance), regularization of this score, its use in a dynamic fusion mechanism, and the evaluation strategy. The link between the score and adaptive fusion is well-articulated, making the core concept immediately understandable. While specific implementation details (e.g., exact loss functions) are omitted, the overall framework and objectives are crystal clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While adaptive fusion and quantifying modality relationships are existing research areas, the proposed method offers a novel approach. Specifically, the combination of using contrastive learning to establish shared/specific spaces, defining a discrepancy score based on pairwise sample relationships (like OT distance) within this space, explicitly regularizing this score, and directly using it to dynamically weight modalities during inference presents a fresh perspective. The addition of theoretical analysis linking the score to downstream performance further enhances its novelty. It cleverly integrates several concepts into a cohesive and potentially innovative framework."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible. Contrastive learning is a well-established technique with many available frameworks. Calculating pairwise similarity measures like cosine similarity is standard. Optimal Transport (OT) distance calculation can be computationally intensive, but efficient approximations exist, making it feasible for many deep learning applications. Implementing a dynamic weighting scheme based on the calculated score is straightforward. Standard multimodal benchmarks exist, and simulating missing modalities or adding noise for evaluation is common practice. The theoretical analysis might pose challenges but is a standard component of ML research. Overall, implementation seems practical with standard ML resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and potential impact. It addresses the critical and practical problem of effectively fusing information from multiple modalities, especially when they vary in quality, relevance, or alignment. Improving robustness to missing modalities and noise is crucial for real-world deployment in areas like autonomous driving and medical imaging (as mentioned). A principled, quantifiable measure of modality dissimilarity that guides fusion could lead to more robust, efficient, and potentially interpretable multimodal systems. Success in this research could provide valuable insights into modality interactions and significantly advance the state-of-the-art in adaptive multimodal learning."
