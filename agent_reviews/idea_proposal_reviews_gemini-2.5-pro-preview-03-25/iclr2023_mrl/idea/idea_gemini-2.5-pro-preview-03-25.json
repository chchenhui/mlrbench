    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task description. It directly addresses several key questions posed: 'How does the geometry of the representation space affect the quality of the learned representations?' (Representation Q2), 'How can we promote useful properties of multimodal representations?' (Training Q1), and 'How do different learning objectives influence the resulting representations?' (Training Q3). The focus on understanding and improving representation geometry through explicit alignment objectives fits perfectly within the workshop's aim to gain systematic insights into multimodal representations and improve training methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (geometric misalignment), the proposed approach (explicit geometric alignment using OT/Riemannian methods), the contrast with existing methods (instance-level alignment), the hypothesis (more robust representations), and the evaluation plan (geometry analysis, downstream tasks) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and how success will be measured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While instance-level alignment (e.g., contrastive loss) is common in multimodal learning, and geometric methods like OT and Riemannian geometry exist in ML, the specific proposal to use these techniques to *explicitly enforce structural/geometric alignment between modality-specific manifolds within a shared embedding space* during training is innovative. It shifts the focus from aligning individual data points to aligning the overall geometric structure of the representations for each modality, offering a fresh perspective on cross-modal representation learning."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Optimal Transport methods (especially approximations like Sinkhorn) are usable in deep learning, though potentially computationally intensive. Riemannian geometry methods are more complex, requiring specialized optimization techniques and careful implementation within standard frameworks. Suitable datasets and evaluation metrics exist. However, integrating these geometric objectives effectively and efficiently requires significant technical expertise and careful engineering. The analysis of representation geometry also requires specialized tools."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Improving the quality, robustness, and semantic richness of multimodal representations is a fundamental goal in ML. Addressing the potential issue of geometric misalignment could lead to tangible improvements in various downstream tasks requiring fine-grained cross-modal understanding (retrieval, translation, VQA, generation). Success would provide valuable insights into the nature of multimodal spaces and offer a new direction for designing more effective representation learning objectives, aligning well with the workshop's goal of advancing fundamental questions."
