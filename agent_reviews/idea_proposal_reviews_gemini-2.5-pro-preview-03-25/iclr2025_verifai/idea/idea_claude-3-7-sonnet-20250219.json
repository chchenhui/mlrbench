        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of the VerifAI workshop: the intersection of generative AI (LLMs) and verification (static analysis). It fits squarely into the suggested angle 'Formal methods for generative AI' by proposing to use static analysis tools to guide LLM generation. Furthermore, it aligns perfectly with the 'Special Theme: LLMs for Code Generation', explicitly mentioning the integration of static analyzers to improve code generated by LLMs, which is highlighted in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (reliability issues in LLM code generation, limitations of post-hoc verification) is well-defined. The main idea involving a three-stage RL framework (generate, verify with static analysis, feedback) is clearly explained. The goal of the LLM internalizing verification criteria is also stated clearly. Minor ambiguity exists regarding the exact mechanism for transforming diverse static analyzer outputs into 'precise natural language guidance' suitable for the LLM, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using static analysis post-generation or using RL for LLMs isn't new, the proposed approach of tightly integrating static analysis feedback *within* an RL loop specifically to guide the generation process and encourage the LLM to 'think like a verifier' offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond simple filtering or basic execution feedback by aiming for internalization of verification principles derived from static analysis. The combination of multiple analyzers and structured NL feedback within this specific RL framework constitutes a novel contribution, even though it builds upon existing components."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core components (LLMs, static analyzers, RL frameworks) are available. However, integrating potentially diverse outputs from multiple static analyzers into a coherent feedback signal is complex. Designing an effective mechanism to translate technical static analysis reports into 'precise natural language guidance' that an LLM can effectively learn from via RL is a major hurdle. Furthermore, RL training for LLMs is computationally expensive, and ensuring the model truly internalizes verification principles rather than overfitting to the specific analyzers/feedback format requires careful experimental design and reward engineering. Considerable effort and resources would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Improving the correctness, security, and reliability of code generated by LLMs is a critical challenge in AI-assisted software development. Successfully implementing this idea could lead to LLMs that produce more trustworthy code natively, reducing downstream verification and debugging efforts. This directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging AI and verification for more robust systems and could have a meaningful impact on the practical application of LLMs in coding."
