        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (VerifAI workshop CFP). It directly addresses the intersection of generative AI (LLMs) and formal methods/verification. It fits squarely into the suggested angle 'Formal methods for generative AI' by proposing to use formal verification tools (SMT solvers, static analyzers) to improve LLM outputs. Furthermore, it explicitly targets the workshop's 'Special Theme: LLMs for Code Generation', focusing on improving safety and effectiveness, mentioning relevant tools (static analyzers, SMT solvers), and addressing low-resource programming languages, all highlighted in the theme description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (LLM correctness issues, especially low-resource), the core mechanism (RL with formal verification as reward), the tools involved (SMT solvers, static analyzers), the target domain (low-resource languages like Raku, Nim), and the expected outcomes are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The concept of synthesizing specifications is mentioned, which could benefit from slightly more detail, but the overall proposal is immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using RL to fine-tune LLMs for code generation and using post-hoc verification/repair are known techniques, the proposed integration of formal verification *directly into the RL training loop* as the primary reward signal is a relatively novel approach. It moves beyond reactive repair or simple execution feedback towards proactive correctness guidance during training. The focus on applying this to low-resource languages, including specification synthesis, adds another layer of novelty, although specification synthesis itself is an existing research area. It offers a fresh perspective on bridging probabilistic models and formal guarantees."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Key hurdles include: 1) The computational cost of running formal verification tools (SMT solvers, static analyzers) repeatedly within an RL loop, which could create a major bottleneck. 2) The difficulty of automatically synthesizing accurate and useful formal specifications, especially for diverse codebases in low-resource languages. 3) Designing an effective reward function based on verification outcomes (beyond simple pass/fail) that provides a useful learning signal. 4) Availability of suitable benchmarks, codebases, and robust verification tools for the targeted low-resource languages (Raku, Nim). While conceptually sound, overcoming these practical issues requires considerable effort and potentially new techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Ensuring the functional correctness and safety of LLM-generated code is a critical challenge for deploying these models reliably. The proposed approach directly tackles this by integrating formal guarantees into the generation process. Success could lead to major advancements in trustworthy AI-driven code synthesis, reducing the need for extensive post-hoc validation and repair. Addressing low-resource languages further broadens the potential impact. It contributes directly to the important goal of bridging probabilistic AI and formal methods for safer systems."
