    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the VerifAI workshop's theme of bridging generative AI (LLMs) and formal methods (ITPs) by proposing an LLM-based system (LLM-TAC) to automate tactic generation, guided by feedback from the theorem prover itself. This aligns with the 'Generative AI for formal methods' and 'Formal methods for generative AI' angles mentioned in the task description. The methodology directly implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea (contextual encoding, generation/verification, RL loop). Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself relative to the cited literature (LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA), acknowledging their contributions and aiming to build upon them, particularly by incorporating a structured RL feedback loop based on prover output, addressing challenges highlighted in the review like context understanding and tactic accuracy."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of data collection, preprocessing, algorithm design (including the three stages of encoding, generation/verification, and RL), experimental setup, and implementation details. The structure is logical, progressing from background to impact. Technical formulations for the encoding combination and reward function are provided. Minor areas, such as the specific architecture or role of the Graph Neural Network (GNN) component in the hybrid encoding and the precise details of the retrieval mechanism, could benefit from slight elaboration, but overall the proposal is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While using LLMs for theorem proving and tactic generation is an active area of research (as shown by the literature review citing LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA), the proposed LLM-TAC framework introduces novelty through its specific combination of techniques. Key novel aspects include the structured reinforcement learning loop using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a carefully defined reward function distinguishing between syntactic and semantic errors based on direct feedback from the theorem prover, and the proposed hybrid encoding combining textual (Transformer) and structural (GNN) features of the proof state. While components like retrieval augmentation and LLM generation exist in prior work, the integrated system focusing on RL refinement based on formal verification feedback presents a distinct and innovative approach compared to the cited baselines."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in machine learning (LLMs, transformers, GNNs, RL/PPO) and formal methods (ITPs, tactics, proof states). The methodology is logical: data curation from established sources, state representation, LLM generation constrained by syntax, formal verification via the prover, and an RL loop for refinement based on correctness feedback. The use of prover feedback to generate rewards for RL is a sound way to ground the probabilistic model in formal correctness. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics. Technical formulations are mostly correct and clearly presented. Minor points, like fully justifying the GNN's contribution or addressing potential RL training complexities, could add further rigor, but the core approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. It leverages existing technologies (LLMs like CodeLlama, RL libraries, ITPs like Coq/Lean) and tools (LeanDojo). The plan outlines clear steps for data collection, model training, and evaluation. The specified computational resources (4x A100 GPUs) are substantial but appropriate for the task. However, integrating all components (retrieval, GNN, transformer, LLM, ITP interaction, RL loop) into a robust system is complex and requires significant engineering effort. Achieving the ambitious performance goals (≥50% reduction in manual effort, ≥15% improvement over baselines) is not guaranteed and depends heavily on the effectiveness of the RL training and the quality of the data/feedback. The user study also adds logistical overhead. Overall, it's feasible but challenging."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the adoption and scaling of formal methods – the laborious process of tactic engineering in interactive theorem provers. Automating or significantly assisting this process could dramatically accelerate research in formalized mathematics and the development of verified software, making these powerful techniques more accessible to a wider audience. Successfully integrating LLMs with formal verification feedback in a reliable way would represent a major advancement at the intersection of AI and formal methods. The planned open-source release of models and tools would further amplify its impact on the research community, directly contributing to the goals of the VerifAI workshop."
