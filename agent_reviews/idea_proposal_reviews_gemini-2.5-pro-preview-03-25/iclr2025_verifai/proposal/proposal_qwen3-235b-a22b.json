        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the VerifAI workshop's theme of 'Generative AI for formal methods' by proposing an LLM-based system to automate tactic generation in ITPs. It faithfully expands on the core concepts outlined in the research idea (LLM-TAC, contextual encoding, generation/verification, RL loop). Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to overcome the limitations of prior work (LeanDojo, COPRA) mentioned in the literature review, particularly regarding contextual understanding, generation accuracy, and the lack of dynamic refinement, which the proposed RL loop targets."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section details the data sources, preprocessing, algorithmic components (retrieval, generation, RL), and experimental setup (metrics, baselines). The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise architecture details of the transformer encoder or the specific justification for the weighting factor alpha in the retrieval formula and the inclusion of BLEU in the reward function alongside execution success. However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it builds upon existing concepts like retrieval-augmented generation (LeanDojo) and LLMs for proof steps (LLMSTEP, COPRA), the core novelty lies in the proposed integration of an explicit Reinforcement Learning loop that uses feedback from tactic execution within the ITP (Coq/Lean) to iteratively refine the tactic generation model (G_{\\\\theta}). This end-to-end, execution-feedback-driven RL refinement for tactic *autogeneration* distinguishes it from the cited works, which focus more on premise selection, single-step suggestion, or in-context learning without explicitly training the generator via RL on execution outcomes in this manner. The combination of retrieval, generation, verification, and RL refinement into a single framework (LLM-TAC) is a fresh approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established techniques: retrieval-augmented models, LLM fine-tuning, ITP execution for validation (SerAPI), and policy gradient methods (REINFORCE) for RL. The methodology is well-described, including data processing, model components, and evaluation procedures. The technical formulations for retrieval, generation, and RL appear correct. The inclusion of relevant baselines and standard metrics strengthens the experimental design. Minor weaknesses include the ambitious quantitative claims (e.g., 50% cost reduction) which require strong empirical evidence, and the lack of justification for specific hyperparameters (e.g., \\\\alpha=0.75, \\\\gamma=0.95). The reliance on BLEU score in the reward function alongside execution success might need further justification regarding its direct contribution to proof quality."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology (LLMs like Llama-3, ITPs like Coq/Lean, RL algorithms) and methods. Data sources are available (Coq libraries). However, implementing the full system, particularly the seamless integration of the LLM, ITP execution environment (SerAPI), and the RL loop, presents significant engineering challenges. Training the RL agent will likely require substantial computational resources due to repeated tactic executions within the prover. The proposal acknowledges potential issues like latency and overfitting and suggests reasonable mitigations (quantization, caching, RL techniques). Achieving the high performance targets is ambitious but plausible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Automating tactic generation addresses a major bottleneck in interactive theorem proving, a critical area for software verification and formalized mathematics. Success would substantially lower the barrier to entry for ITPs, potentially accelerating research and development in verified systems and large-scale mathematical formalization. The goal of creating a 'human-AI proof engineering' paradigm is forward-looking. Releasing datasets and models would be a valuable contribution to the community. The research directly aligns with the core themes of the VerifAI workshop, bridging generative AI and formal methods effectively."
