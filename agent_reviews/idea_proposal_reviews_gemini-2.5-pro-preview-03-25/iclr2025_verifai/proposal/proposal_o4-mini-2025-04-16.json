    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (VerifAI workshop theme on AI for formal methods), the research idea (LLM-guided tactic generation with RL), and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for integrating AI to enhance verification practices, specifically by automating tactic generation in ITPs. It elaborates clearly on the core concepts outlined in the research idea, including contextual encoding, tactic generation, verification feedback, and the RL loop. Furthermore, it explicitly references and positions itself relative to the cited works (LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA, Lean Copilot), aiming to advance beyond single-step suggestions or synchronous assistance by focusing on autonomous generation of complete tactic sequences refined via RL based on proof outcomes. It also acknowledges and proposes solutions related to the key challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes) is logical and easy to follow. The research objectives are explicitly listed and unambiguous. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the four key components (Data Collection, Encoding, Generation/Verification, RL) with specific techniques (retrieval, transformer architecture details, REINFORCE algorithm, reward function) clearly articulated. The experimental design, including benchmarks, baselines, metrics (PSR, MIR, etc.), and statistical analysis, is thoroughly described. The language is precise and uses appropriate technical terminology, making the proposal readily understandable to experts in ML and formal methods."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While leveraging existing concepts like LLMs for code/proof generation (LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, Lean Copilot) and retrieval augmentation, its core novelty lies in the proposed combination for *autonomous generation of complete tactic sequences* coupled with a *closed reinforcement learning loop* explicitly using proof success/failure as the reward signal to fine-tune the generative model. This contrasts with prior work focusing primarily on single-step suggestions or using LLMs within interactive loops without the same emphasis on autonomous sequence generation refined by RL based on proof outcomes. The integration of these elements specifically for tactic *script* generation represents a fresh and potentially impactful approach in the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid foundations in LLMs, sequence generation, retrieval-augmented methods, and reinforcement learning (specifically REINFORCE). The proposed methodology, including data preprocessing, contextual encoding using retrieval, sequence generation via a transformer, and policy gradient RL, is well-established and appropriate for the task. The technical formulations for the reward function and policy gradient update are standard and correctly presented. The experimental design includes relevant benchmarks, strong baselines from the literature, and appropriate evaluation metrics. Minor areas for potential refinement might include more detail on handling RL variance or specific retriever model choices, but the overall approach is robust and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and resources. Collecting the proposed datasets from established Coq and Lean libraries is achievable. Training a ~110M parameter model on 8 A100 GPUs is within the realm of standard academic compute resources. The core technologies (LLMs, ITPs, RL frameworks) are available. However, challenges exist: integrating the LLM robustly with the ITP execution environment requires significant engineering effort. Training RL for complex sequence generation tasks can be unstable and require careful tuning. Achieving the ambitious 50% reduction in manual tactic writing across diverse benchmarks might prove difficult. While the plan is generally realistic, these factors introduce moderate implementation risks and suggest significant effort will be required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the formal methods community: the labor-intensive nature of tactic writing in ITPs, which is a major bottleneck for scaling formal verification. If successful, automating tactic generation could dramatically accelerate the development of large formal libraries (like mathlib or mathcomp), lower the barrier to entry for new users of ITPs, and enable the verification of more complex software and mathematical theorems. The goal of a 50% reduction in manual effort is ambitious but highlights the potential for substantial impact. The project aligns perfectly with the VerifAI workshop's theme and has the potential to make major contributions to the intersection of AI and formal verification, including releasing valuable open-source artifacts."
