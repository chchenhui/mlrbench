        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses 'sim-to-real bridging', explicitly listed as a specific area of interest for the workshop. Furthermore, the goal of achieving robust robot skills that adapt to real-world conditions aligns perfectly with the workshop's central theme of moving 'towards robots with human-level abilities' capable of performing tasks in unstructured environments like homes. The proposed methods involve novel ML algorithms for robot control, another key area mentioned."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (reality gap) is explicitly stated, and the proposed solution is broken down into three distinct and understandable technical components: neural system identification, meta-learning for adaptation, and uncertainty-aware control. The core concept of continuous online adaptation is clearly articulated as the main differentiator. The evaluation plan (manipulation tasks) is also mentioned, leaving little ambiguity about the research direction."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While sim-to-real, system identification, meta-learning, and uncertainty awareness are existing concepts, the proposed integration into a single, continuously self-adaptive framework for online refinement during deployment is innovative. Specifically, combining online neural system ID with meta-learning explicitly optimized for rapid adaptation (not just performance) and using uncertainty to actively guide this online adaptation process offers a fresh perspective compared to traditional domain randomization or offline adaptation techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing methods and technology, but presents non-trivial implementation challenges. Each component (neural sys ID, meta-learning, uncertainty quantification) is an active research area with available techniques. However, integrating them into a robust, real-time, online system for physical robots requires significant engineering effort, careful system design, and potentially substantial computational resources. Ensuring safety during online learning and exploration on a physical robot adds another layer of complexity. It's ambitious but achievable in a dedicated research setting."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. The 'reality gap' remains a fundamental obstacle preventing widespread deployment of learned robot skills. A successful self-adaptive sim-to-real framework that reduces the need for manual tuning and improves robustness in dynamic real-world conditions would represent a major advancement. This directly contributes to the workshop's goal of enabling robots with more general physical capabilities, potentially impacting applications from household assistance to industrial automation."
