    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'sim-to-real bridging' challenge highlighted in the task description, focusing on robust robot skills for unstructured environments, which aligns with the workshop theme of 'Robots with Human-Level Abilities'. The methodology (online system ID, meta-learning, uncertainty-aware control) perfectly matches the research idea and incorporates techniques discussed in the provided literature review (e.g., MAML for adaptation, ensemble uncertainty, online system ID). The objectives and proposed experiments directly target the core issues raised."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context and objectives unambiguously. The methodology section breaks down the framework into logical components (System ID, Meta-Learning, Control, Integration) with clear explanations and supporting mathematical formulations where appropriate. The experimental design is detailed, specifying environments, tasks, baselines, metrics, and procedures. The structure is logical, and the language is precise, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating three key techniques (online neural system ID, meta-learning for rapid policy adaptation, and uncertainty-aware MPC) into a unified, continuously self-adaptive framework. While individual components draw inspiration from recent work cited in the literature review (e.g., MAML for adaptation, ensemble-based uncertainty), the specific combination and focus on simultaneous online model refinement and policy adaptation guided by uncertainty for sim-to-real transfer represents a novel synthesis. It's not introducing entirely new algorithms but offers a fresh perspective on combining existing ones for enhanced robustness and adaptation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established methods like neural network dynamics modeling, ensemble methods for uncertainty quantification, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The mathematical formulations provided for system identification, meta-learning, and the uncertainty-aware cost function are standard and appropriate. The overall framework logic is coherent. A minor weakness is the lack of explicit discussion on stability guarantees during online adaptation, which is a known challenge mentioned in the literature review, although the uncertainty-aware control implicitly aims for safer behavior."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current robotics hardware (Franka manipulator), simulation tools (PyBullet/MuJoCo), and machine learning techniques. The components (neural nets, MAML, MPC) are implementable. However, the integration of these components into a real-time online loop presents significant computational challenges, especially the ensemble updates, MAML gradient steps, and MPC optimization. Achieving the claimed adaptation speed (<500 real steps, 5-10 episodes) might require substantial computational resources and careful implementation tuning. While challenging, it is within the realm of possibility for a well-equipped research lab."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses the critical and persistent 'reality gap' problem in robot learning, which is a major barrier to deploying robots in real-world, unstructured environments. Successfully developing a self-adaptive framework that enables robust online sim-to-real transfer would be highly significant. It has the potential to greatly improve robot autonomy and adaptability across various applications (household, industrial), aligning perfectly with the workshop's theme. The potential contributions to methodology, benchmarks, and understanding the interplay of adaptation and uncertainty are substantial."
