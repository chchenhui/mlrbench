    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's interest in 'sim-to-real bridging', 'data efficiency', and achieving 'human-level abilities' through robust robot skills. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core research idea (combining neural sys ID, meta-learning, and uncertainty-aware control). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the concepts and specific papers mentioned in the literature review (e.g., Mei et al. 2025, He et al. 2024, Ren et al. 2023, Kim et al. 2023, Wilson et al. 2025, Green et al. 2024), and tackles the key challenges identified therein, such as the reality gap, online adaptation, and uncertainty management."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context effectively, research objectives are explicitly listed, and the significance is well-argued. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of each component (Neural System ID, Meta-Learning, Uncertainty-Aware Control) with relevant mathematical formulations and procedural descriptions. The integration of these components and the experimental plan are also clearly outlined. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the proposed approach and evaluation strategy."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating three distinct, state-of-the-art techniques (online neural system ID, meta-learning for control adaptation, and uncertainty-aware MPC using ensemble divergence) into a unified framework for continuous, self-adaptive sim-to-real transfer. While the individual components draw inspiration from recent work cited in the literature review, their specific combination and application towards *continuous online adaptation* during deployment represents a fresh perspective compared to methods focusing solely on pre-deployment randomization or offline adaptation. The novelty lies in the synergistic integration and the focus on progressive, experience-driven refinement of both dynamics models and policies in the real world."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in system identification, meta-learning (MAML), model predictive control, and uncertainty quantification (probabilistic ensembles, Jensen-Renyi divergence). The mathematical formulations presented for each component are appropriate and clearly described, referencing relevant recent literature. The proposed methodology for integrating these components is logical. A minor weakness is the lack of explicit discussion on stability guarantees for the online adaptation process, which is a known challenge in learning-based control, although often omitted in initial proposals."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. It requires substantial expertise across multiple domains (RL, meta-learning, control, system ID) and access to appropriate hardware (7-DOF arm, sensors) and simulation tools (MuJoCo, PyTorch), which are standard for well-equipped labs. Key challenges include the computational cost of uncertainty-aware MPC with ensemble rollouts (potentially impacting real-time execution), the inherent difficulties in training and tuning MAML, and the complexity of ensuring stable online adaptation of both the dynamics model and the policy simultaneously. The experimental plan is ambitious but well-structured. Overall, it's challenging but achievable with dedicated effort and resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and persistent problem in robotics: the reality gap, which severely limits the deployment of simulation-trained policies. Enabling robots to continuously and autonomously adapt to real-world conditions without extensive manual intervention would be a major advancement. Success would significantly enhance robot robustness, versatility, and applicability in unstructured environments (e.g., homes, logistics, manufacturing), directly contributing to the goal of achieving human-level abilities. The potential impact on both practical robotics and the scientific understanding of adaptation is substantial."
