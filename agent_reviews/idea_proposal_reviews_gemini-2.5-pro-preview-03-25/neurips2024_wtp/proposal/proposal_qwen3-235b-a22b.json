    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for robust video-language alignment benchmarks and tackles the scarcity of fine-grained annotated data. It perfectly operationalizes the research idea of creating FineActionBench for phrase-level temporal localization using dense annotations and specific metrics like T-IoU. Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, acknowledging existing benchmarks (TemporalBench, E.T. Bench, FIBER) while clearly differentiating its focus on phrase localization, leveraging relevant datasets (FineAction), and citing appropriate recent models (VidLA, VideoComp, Grounded-VideoLLM, PiTe) for baselines. It explicitly addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from motivation and objectives to detailed methodology and expected impact. Research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology sections (Data Collection, Benchmark Design, Experimental Design) provide precise details, including data sources, annotation protocols, task definition, metric formulas (T-IoU), baseline model choices, training procedures, and evaluation plans. The language is unambiguous, and technical concepts are explained or used appropriately. The deliverables are clearly specified, leaving no significant room for misinterpretation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While temporal grounding and video-language benchmarks are existing research areas, FineActionBench carves out a specific and valuable niche by focusing explicitly on *phrase-level* temporal localization. This distinguishes it from existing benchmarks like TemporalBench (QA-based), E.T. Bench (event-level), and FIBER (retrieval-focused). Although it builds upon the existing FineAction dataset and uses a standard metric (T-IoU), the proposed expansion of the dataset, the specific task formulation (localizing given phrases), and the potential introduction of weighted metrics (T-IoU_w) represent a novel contribution to evaluating a critical fine-grained capability currently under-benchmarked."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built on the established need for better temporal alignment evaluation. The methodology is robust: data curation criteria are sensible, the annotation protocol includes multiple annotators, conflict resolution, and quality control (kappa score, AMT validation). The benchmark design features a clear task and appropriate metrics (T-IoU, mAP, R@K, MedR), with correct technical formulation for T-IoU. The experimental design includes relevant SOTA baselines justified by recent literature, a standard training protocol, rigorous evaluation (cross-validation, stratification), and pertinent ablation studies. The approach is well-grounded in existing research and best practices."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Leveraging the existing FineAction dataset reduces the initial burden. The planned expansion (5K videos) and dense phrase-level annotation require significant effort and resources (annotator time, potential cost for experts/AMT, compute resources for baselines) but are achievable within a well-funded research project. The annotation protocol (multiple annotators, validation) is standard but demanding. Training the specified baseline models is computationally intensive but technically feasible using existing architectures and pre-trained weights. Open-sourcing is planned, enhancing reproducibility. The main risks involve resource acquisition and maintaining high annotation quality, but these are manageable challenges common to benchmark creation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal holds high significance. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged gap in VLM evaluation â€“ the lack of benchmarks specifically targeting fine-grained, phrase-level temporal alignment. Success would provide a much-needed standardized tool for the research community, enabling more accurate assessment and comparison of models' temporal grounding abilities. This could directly stimulate progress in developing models with better temporal understanding, impacting applications requiring precision, such as robotics, instructional video analysis, accessibility tools, and surveillance, as outlined in the proposal and consistent with the workshop's goals."
