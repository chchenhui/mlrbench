    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for robust video-language alignment benchmarks highlighted in the task description. It elaborates precisely on the research idea of creating FineActionBench for fine-grained temporal grounding. Furthermore, it effectively positions itself against the cited literature (TemporalBench, VideoComp, FIBER, etc.), clearly stating its unique focus on phrase-to-segment grounding, differentiating it from existing benchmarks focused on QA, retrieval, or event-level understanding. It plans to use relevant datasets (FineAction) and models (PiTe, Grounded-VideoLLM) mentioned in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, metrics (including formulas and conceptual descriptions), experimental design, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The structure is logical, flowing naturally from motivation to implementation and impact. Technical aspects, like the adaptation of the PiTe framework, are explained sufficiently for a proposal. Minor details could be added, but the overall message is immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building upon existing concepts (temporal localization, T-IoU) and datasets (FineAction), its core contribution – a benchmark specifically for fine-grained *phrase-to-segment* temporal grounding in multi-step activities – addresses a distinct gap. The literature review confirms that existing benchmarks focus on related but different tasks (QA, retrieval, event-level grounding, compositional negatives). The proposed focus on grounding arbitrary descriptive phrases to precise segments, combined with tailored hierarchical and ablation metrics (TRS, LTDS), constitutes a novel and valuable contribution to the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It relies on solid foundations, referencing relevant prior work and established methodologies. The data curation plan (using existing sources, expert annotation, validation via Fleiss' kappa) is standard and robust. The proposed evaluation metrics (T-IoU, Hierarchical Accuracy) are appropriate for the task. The experimental design, including baseline model selection (SOTA models like PiTe, Grounded-VideoLLM) and ablation studies, is comprehensive. The outlined adaptation of the PiTe framework provides sufficient technical detail and appears plausible. The methodology is well-justified and technically coherent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Curating videos and implementing metrics/models are standard tasks. However, the proposed annotation process (5,000 videos, 50,000 phrase-segment pairs with high agreement) is resource-intensive (time, cost, annotator management) and represents the most significant hurdle. While achievable with sufficient resources and careful planning (including the proposed validation step), the scale of annotation introduces non-trivial risk and effort. Access to compute resources for evaluating large models is also assumed but generally feasible in a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and acknowledged gap in video-language research: the lack of benchmarks for evaluating fine-grained temporal grounding. Such a capability is crucial for advancing applications like precise video search, instructional video understanding, and robotics. By providing a standardized dataset, tailored metrics, and baseline results, FineActionBench has the potential to accelerate progress, facilitate meaningful comparisons between models, and guide future research towards better temporal reasoning, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the task description."
