    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly identifies the lack of robust video-language alignment benchmarks as a key challenge ('Last but not least, the community still lacks robust video-language alignment benchmarks...'). The proposed idea directly addresses this challenge by suggesting the development of a comprehensive benchmark suite. It also touches upon the need for high-quality data (Topic 1) and evaluating multimodal integration (Topic 3)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (lack of robust benchmarks), the main proposal (a multi-aspect benchmark suite), the specific dimensions for evaluation (temporal reasoning, multimodal integration, cultural context, fine-grained action recognition), and the intended output (standardized tests, specific metrics, detailed leaderboard). The goal of driving targeted improvements is also clearly articulated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers good novelty. While video benchmarks exist, the proposal emphasizes a *comprehensive suite* covering multiple, specifically chosen dimensions (including less common ones like cultural context) and advocates for a *detailed capability breakdown* leaderboard instead of single scores. This multi-faceted approach to evaluation structure and the specific combination of evaluation dimensions provide a fresh perspective compared to many existing benchmarks that might focus on fewer aspects."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Creating diverse, high-quality video datasets with reliable annotations across multiple complex dimensions (temporal, multimodal, cultural, fine-grained action) is extremely resource-intensive and time-consuming. Defining objective and robust metrics, especially for 'cultural context understanding', is also non-trivial. While the leaderboard aspect is standard, the core data creation and annotation represent a major hurdle requiring substantial effort and funding."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. As highlighted in both the proposal's motivation and the workshop task description, the lack of standardized, comprehensive benchmarks is a major bottleneck hindering progress in video-language models. Developing such a benchmark would provide a crucial tool for the research community to rigorously evaluate models, compare approaches effectively, identify specific weaknesses, and drive targeted advancements, ultimately accelerating progress towards real-world applications."
