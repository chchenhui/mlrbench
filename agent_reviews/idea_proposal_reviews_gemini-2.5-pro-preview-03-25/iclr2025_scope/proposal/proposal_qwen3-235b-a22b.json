        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable optimization, efficient adaptation, long context understanding, RAG integration, and sub-quadratic models. The methodology clearly implements the core concepts from the research idea (RL-based sparse retrieval, sparse attention, compressive KV caching). It effectively positions itself against and builds upon the cited literature, referencing specific methods like RazorAttention, PyramidKV, GCA, and LongRAG, and addressing key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The objectives, overall methodology, and experimental plan are well-articulated. However, some technical details could be more precise. For instance, the exact mechanism of the 'rotating low-rank KV cache' (how SVD is applied, how latent states are used) needs further elaboration. The definition of the action space for the RL agent could be clearer regarding the source of tokens (internal cache vs. external DB). Additionally, the 'Attention sparsity' term in the hybrid loss function (||\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{att}}||_F^2) seems unconventional and potentially incorrect, requiring clarification or correction."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating three key components (RL-based dynamic sparse retrieval, sparse attention on retrieved tokens, and a rotating compressive KV cache) into a single, end-to-end optimized framework. While individual components draw inspiration from existing work (RL for retrieval, sparse attention, KV compression), their specific combination and co-optimization strategy appear novel. Particularly, the dynamic, query-specific token selection via RL combined with the rotating low-rank cache for historical context presents a fresh approach compared to static pruning or chunking methods cited in the literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, based on established techniques like RL (PPO), sparse attention, and low-rank approximations (SVD). The overall approach of combining retrieval, sparse attention, and caching is logical for the stated goals. However, there are minor weaknesses. The theoretical complexity claim of O(n log n) relies on the RL agent learning to select k=O(log n) tokens, which needs stronger justification than citing general sparse attention papers. The rotating cache mechanism requires more detail on its computational overhead (SVD cost) and how information loss is managed. The most significant concern is the potentially incorrect formulation of the 'Attention sparsity' term in the hybrid loss function, which slightly undermines the rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating RL, custom sparse attention, and a novel caching mechanism into large foundation models is complex and requires substantial engineering effort and computational resources. Training the RL component effectively can be difficult and resource-intensive. Evaluating on extremely long sequences (16M tokens for passkey retrieval) is technically demanding and may require specialized infrastructure. While the datasets and baselines are appropriate, the overall complexity and resource requirements make successful execution challenging, introducing moderate risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and timely problem in machine learning: enabling efficient long-context understanding and adaptation for foundation models. If successful, the proposed DSRAM framework could lead to major advancements in deploying LLMs for real-time applications like news analysis and knowledge-intensive tasks, offering substantial improvements in latency and memory efficiency. The research directly tackles key challenges highlighted by the workshop and has the potential for high impact, both theoretically (end-to-end sparse retrieval framework, compressive state theory) and practically (enabling scalable, adaptive LLMs). The plan to open-source further enhances its potential significance."
