    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of efficient long context understanding, sub-quadratic models, RAG for efficiency, and adaptive models. The methodology clearly implements the research idea's core concepts (dynamic sparse retrieval, sparse attention, compressive KV cache). It effectively synthesizes challenges and techniques highlighted in the literature review (e.g., context pruning, KV cache compression, efficient attention) into a unified framework. All components work towards the stated goal of efficient long-context adaptation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly written. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section breaks down the complex system into understandable components (DSR, SQA, RCKV, HOF). Key concepts are explained, and mathematical formulations are provided for core mechanisms like retrieval scoring, RL optimization, and compression loss. The system architecture diagram aids understanding. While generally clear, some implementation details (e.g., the exact nature of the 'lightweight query analyzer' or the 'importance function' for RCKV) could be more specific, but the overall research plan is well-articulated and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality by proposing a *unified framework* that integrates three distinct techniques: 1) RL-optimized dynamic sparse *token-level* retrieval, 2) cluster-based sparse attention operating *only* on retrieved tokens, and 3) a *rotating* compressive KV cache using low-rank projections and importance weighting. While individual components draw inspiration from existing work (sparse attention, KV compression, RL for optimization), their specific combination and end-to-end co-optimization strategy appear novel. It moves beyond addressing single bottlenecks (like just KV cache or just retrieval) to tackle the problem holistically, distinguishing it from many papers in the literature review that focus on one aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established principles (RAG, sparse attention, RL, low-rank approximation). The proposed methods for each component (bi-encoder retrieval, PPO for RL, cluster-based attention, low-rank compression) are technically plausible. The hybrid optimization framework with a multi-objective loss and curriculum learning is a reasonable approach for tackling the complex training dynamics. However, the soundness relies on the successful integration and tuning of these complex parts. Potential weaknesses include the stability of RL training for the retriever, the effectiveness of the RCKV importance weighting and reconstruction, and the potential for error accumulation. The technical formulations are mostly correct but high-level in places."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating RL-based retrieval, custom sparse attention, and a novel rotating compressive KV cache into a large foundation model, and then training it end-to-end with a complex hybrid loss, is technically demanding. It requires substantial computational resources, deep expertise in multiple ML areas (transformers, RL, optimization), and careful engineering. Tuning the numerous hyperparameters (RL rewards, loss weights, compression rates, buffer rotation strategy) will be complex and time-consuming. While conceptually feasible, the practical hurdles and risks associated with getting all components to work synergistically are considerable, making the feasibility only satisfactory."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research addresses a critical bottleneck in current AI: the efficient processing of long contexts by foundation models. Successfully achieving sub-quadratic complexity and constant memory usage for long sequences, especially in an adaptive RAG setting, would be highly impactful. It could enable new real-time applications (streaming data analysis), make powerful models more accessible in resource-constrained environments, and significantly advance the field of efficient AI. The proposal directly targets key limitations discussed in the task description and literature, and its potential contributions are substantial and transformative."
