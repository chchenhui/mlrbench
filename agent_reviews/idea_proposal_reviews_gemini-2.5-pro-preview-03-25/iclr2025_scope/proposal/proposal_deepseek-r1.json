    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of scalable optimization, efficient adaptation, long context understanding, RAG, sub-quadratic models, and KV cache management. The methodology clearly elaborates on the research idea's components (dynamic sparse retrieval, sub-quadratic attention, compressive caching). Furthermore, it explicitly references and positions itself relative to key papers from the literature review (e.g., AttentionRAG, PyramidKV, GCA, LongRAG), showing a deep understanding of prior work and addressing the identified challenges."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The architecture components (retriever, attention, cache) are explained with sufficient detail, including technical aspects like the RL formulation and loss function. The experimental design is thorough and easy to understand. While minor details like the specific low-rank projection method or the exact 'rotation' mechanism beyond FIFO could be elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality by integrating three distinct techniques—dynamic sparse retrieval guided by RL, a modified sub-quadratic attention mechanism (GCA) for retrieved tokens, and a rotating compressive KV cache—into a unified, co-optimized framework. While individual components build upon existing concepts (RAG, sparse attention, KV compression cited in the literature), the specific combination and particularly the use of RL to dynamically adjust retrieval sparsity (k) based on accuracy and cost trade-offs represent a fresh perspective distinct from prior work like static retrieval or simpler pruning methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (transformers, RAG, RL, sparse attention, cache compression) and cites relevant, recent literature. The proposed methodology, including the architecture design, RL formulation for the retriever, and end-to-end training strategy, is generally well-justified and technically plausible. The experimental plan is comprehensive, featuring appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Minor weaknesses include a lack of specific detail on the GCA modification and the low-rank projection technique used for cache compression, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires significant computational resources (A100 GPUs), large datasets, and expertise in multiple areas (LLMs, RAG, RL). The core technical components are based on existing work, making implementation plausible. However, the successful integration and co-optimization of the dynamic retriever (especially the RL component, which can be tricky to tune), sparse attention, and compressive cache represent a complex engineering task. Achieving the ambitious efficiency targets (e.g., 60% memory reduction with 95% accuracy) carries risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: enabling efficient long-context processing and real-time adaptation for foundation models. This is a critical bottleneck for many real-world applications. If successful, the research could lead to major advancements in deploying FMs on resource-constrained devices or for applications requiring continuous updates (e.g., news analysis, financial modeling). The potential impact on latency, memory usage, and adaptability is substantial. The planned contributions (architecture, benchmarks, code) would be valuable to the community."
