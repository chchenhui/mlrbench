        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task calls for submissions on preference-based learning, specifically mentioning 'Multi-objective optimization' and 'Robotics' as key topics. The research idea directly proposes a method for preference-guided multi-objective optimization and plans to evaluate it on a robotics task. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bringing together communities working on preference learning and connecting theory (active learning, GPs, evolutionary algorithms) to practice (robotics, decision support)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem with traditional MOO and the rationale for using preferences. The main idea (AP-MOO) is broken down into four distinct, understandable steps involving evolutionary search, GP surrogates, active learning for preference elicitation, and biasing the search. The evaluation plan and expected outcomes are explicitly mentioned. It is concise and leaves little room for ambiguity, making it immediately understandable to researchers in the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While preference-based multi-objective optimization (PbMOO) is an existing area, and techniques like GPs for utility modeling and active learning for preference elicitation have been explored individually or in different combinations, the specific proposed architecture (AP-MOO) integrating an evolutionary Pareto search, a GP surrogate over the objective-weight simplex, and an active learning strategy based on expected information gain for pairwise comparisons seems to offer a novel synthesis and refinement. It's not groundbreaking in inventing a completely new paradigm but offers a fresh and potentially more efficient combination of existing concepts tailored for active preference guidance."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core components – evolutionary algorithms, Gaussian Processes, and active learning techniques – are well-established methods in machine learning and optimization. Implementing these components and integrating them is achievable with current knowledge and tools. Evaluation on benchmark functions is standard, and while the robotic grasp planning task adds complexity (requiring simulation or hardware access and careful objective definition), it is a common and feasible application area for MOO research. Potential challenges might involve computational scaling or tuning the active learning component, but these seem like engineering challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the important practical problem of navigating complex trade-offs in multi-objective scenarios, which are prevalent in many real-world applications (engineering design, robotics, finance, etc.). By aiming to reduce user burden (fewer queries) and converge faster to personally relevant solutions, the proposed AP-MOO method could lead to more efficient and effective decision-support tools. Success in the robotic grasp planning task would demonstrate tangible benefits in a complex domain, potentially leading to meaningful contributions in robotics and personalized optimization."
