        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task calls for research connecting preference-based learning theory to practice, identifying real-world systems that benefit from preference feedback. This idea proposes applying preference-based RL (a core PbL technique) combined with multi-objective optimization (a listed topic) to a significant real-world system (healthcare decision support). It directly addresses the workshop's goals of bringing communities together (RL, MOO, Healthcare) and connecting theory to practice."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation effectively explains the limitations of traditional RL and single-objective PbRL in healthcare. The proposed approach (combining MOO Pareto fronts with PbRL using trajectory preferences to learn objective weight distributions) is clearly articulated. The target application (medication dosing) and overall goal (transparent, personalized decision support) are explicit and understandable. Minor details about specific algorithms are omitted, which is appropriate for a high-level idea description."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While multi-objective RL and preference-based RL exist independently, the proposed combination specifically for healthcare decision support, focusing on learning a *distribution* over objective weights from preferences on *entire trajectories* to navigate a Pareto front, offers a fresh perspective. It directly tackles the challenge of multi-objective preference elicitation in a complex domain where prior work often simplifies the problem (e.g., single objective, direct weight specification). Applying this specific framework to chronic disease management appears innovative."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Key hurdles include: 1) Eliciting preferences from busy clinicians over complex treatment trajectories, which is time-consuming and requires careful interface design. 2) The computational complexity of maintaining Pareto fronts and learning weight distributions in potentially high-dimensional state-action spaces typical of healthcare. 3) Acquiring sufficient and appropriate data (realistic simulators or anonymized patient data) for training and validation. 4) Robustly evaluating the system's safety and efficacy, which is challenging in healthcare. While feasible as a research project (likely starting with simulators), practical deployment faces considerable obstacles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical problem in healthcare: making complex treatment decisions involving multiple conflicting objectives where numerical rewards are hard to define. Improving decision support for chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension could lead to substantial improvements in patient outcomes and quality of life. The approach aims for more transparent and personalized systems aligned with clinician reasoning, representing a potential major advancement over existing methods. It also contributes methodologically to PbRL and MORL."
