        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task calls for research on preference-based learning, particularly connecting theory to practice in real-world systems. This idea focuses explicitly on using preference feedback (human trajectory comparisons) for a real-world application (robotic manipulation). It directly involves listed topics like Reinforcement Learning and Robotics, and addresses the core motivation of the workshop: leveraging the ease of collecting relative human feedback for complex tasks where other forms of supervision are difficult."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main technical approach (hybrid preference-based IL + active learning + RL), key innovations (diversity-driven sampling, offline RL integration), validation plan (real robots, baselines), and expected outcomes are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. Minor details about specific algorithms are omitted, which is appropriate for a summary, but the overall concept and research direction are immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by proposing a specific synthesis of several existing techniques (preference learning, imitation learning, active learning, offline RL) applied to robotic manipulation. While individual components are known, their combination – particularly using active learning for preference queries in an IL context and integrating the resulting reward model with offline RL for robotics – offers a fresh perspective. The specific innovations like diversity-driven trajectory sampling for preferences add to the novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but presents moderate implementation challenges. Access to robotic hardware and expertise in manipulation is required. Collecting sufficient informative human preferences, even with active learning, can be time-consuming. Integrating preference-based reward models with offline RL requires careful implementation, as offline RL itself can be sensitive to data distribution and hyperparameters. While achievable within a research context, it requires significant engineering effort and careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a critical challenge in robotics: reducing the reliance on costly expert demonstrations for teaching complex manipulation tasks. Success could lead to more scalable and adaptable robot learning, enabling deployment in complex, dynamic environments like healthcare or logistics where traditional programming or IL is difficult. It contributes meaningfully to both robotics and the practical application of preference-based learning."
