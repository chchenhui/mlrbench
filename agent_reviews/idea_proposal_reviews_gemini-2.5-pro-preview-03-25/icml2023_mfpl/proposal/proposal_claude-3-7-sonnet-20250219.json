        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme by focusing on preference-based learning, reinforcement learning, and multi-objective optimization within a real-world healthcare context. The proposal meticulously expands on the core research idea, detailing the motivation and proposed methodology. It also situates the work within the recent literature provided, acknowledging related approaches (e.g., MOPBRL, fairness, human-in-the-loop) and explicitly aiming to address key challenges identified in the review, such as balancing multiple objectives and eliciting preferences in healthcare."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes). The problem statement is compelling, and the proposed methodology is broken down into understandable components (MOMDP formulation, preference learning, Pareto computation, personalization). Mathematical notations are used appropriately and explained. The experimental design is detailed. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the variational inference implementation and the exact mechanism for patient preference elicitation, but overall, the proposal is well-articulated and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While combining multi-objective RL and preference-based learning isn't entirely new (as shown in the literature review), the specific approach of learning a *distribution* over objective weights using Bayesian variational inference (with a Dirichlet prior/posterior) to capture clinician heterogeneity and uncertainty, and subsequently using this distribution to guide Pareto front exploration and personalized recommendations, represents a significant and novel contribution. This distinguishes it from approaches using fixed weights or point estimates, offering a more nuanced model of clinical decision-making. The integration with patient-specific preferences for final recommendation further enhances the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations, including MOMDPs, Bradley-Terry preference models, Bayesian inference, variational inference, and Pareto optimality concepts. The mathematical formulations presented are correct and clearly laid out. The proposed methodology, integrating these components, is logically coherent and technically well-justified. The use of variational inference for approximating the posterior distribution of weights is appropriate given the likely intractability of the exact posterior. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and evaluation metrics, demonstrating methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Accessing suitable de-identified EHR data and recruiting a sufficient number of clinical experts (20-30) for preference elicitation requires significant effort and institutional collaboration. Implementing the integrated framework, particularly the combination of variational inference for weight distribution learning and multi-objective RL for Pareto front computation (e.g., adapting CHVI or similar methods), is technically complex and computationally intensive. Defining accurate reward functions for multiple clinical objectives is non-trivial. However, these challenges are common in healthcare AI research and appear manageable with adequate resources, expertise, and planning. The experimental plan is detailed and realistic."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current AI in healthcare: effectively handling multiple competing objectives and aligning with complex clinical reasoning and patient values. Developing a system that learns from clinician preferences to balance trade-offs and provides personalized recommendations has the potential for major advancements in clinical decision support, personalized medicine, and AI trustworthiness in healthcare. The explicit modeling of multiple objectives also contributes to addressing fairness concerns. The potential impact on clinical practice, patient outcomes, and the broader field of healthcare AI is substantial."
