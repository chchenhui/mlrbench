        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core research idea of combining multi-objective optimization and preference-based RL for healthcare. It fits perfectly within the workshop's scope (preference-based learning, multi-objective optimization, RL, real-world systems like healthcare). The proposal explicitly incorporates concepts and challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as using preference learning to handle multiple objectives, leveraging recent architectures like Preference Transformers, and addressing issues like interpretability and personalization in healthcare."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The background, objectives, and significance are well-articulated. The methodology outlines logical steps for research design and algorithms. However, some areas could be more precise. The mathematical formulation for multi-objective optimization (maximizing a weighted sum) seems inconsistent with the stated goal of maintaining a Pareto front using NSGA-II; the connection between the learned weight distribution and Pareto front navigation/selection needs clearer formalization. Additionally, the proposed evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) are not standard for evaluating RL policies or decision support quality and require clarification or replacement with more appropriate metrics."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the components (MORL, PbRL, Preference Transformers, healthcare applications) exist individually, their specific combination into a framework that learns a *distribution* over objective weights from preferences to navigate a Pareto front for personalized clinical decision support appears novel. It directly tackles the challenge of implicit, multi-objective trade-offs in clinical reasoning, offering a fresh perspective compared to traditional RL or single-objective PbRL. The literature review confirms that while related work exists, this specific synthesis and application focus is innovative."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, based on established concepts in RL, MORL, and PbRL. The motivation is strong and grounded in real-world challenges. However, there are weaknesses. The mathematical formulation for the multi-objective optimization part is imprecise and potentially contradicts the use of Pareto methods like NSGA-II. The proposed evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, etc.) are inappropriate for the task and suggest a lack of rigor in the evaluation plan. While using Preference Transformers and NSGA-II is sound, the details of their integration and how the learned preference distribution guides policy selection from the Pareto front require more rigorous definition to ensure technical soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible from a technical standpoint, as the core algorithms (Preference Transformers, NSGA-II) exist and can be implemented. However, significant practical challenges exist. Collecting high-quality preference data from clinicians is resource-intensive and requires careful experimental design and access. Accessing or simulating realistic patient trajectory data for chronic diseases also presents hurdles (privacy, complexity). Conducting meaningful user studies with healthcare professionals requires substantial effort and collaboration. While achievable for a well-resourced team, data acquisition and clinical evaluation pose moderate risks to successful execution within a typical project timeframe."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in healthcare AI: developing clinical decision support systems that can handle multiple conflicting objectives and align with complex clinical reasoning and patient preferences. Successfully developing such a framework could lead to more personalized, transparent, and trustworthy AI tools, potentially improving treatment decisions, patient outcomes, and clinician acceptance. It tackles key limitations of current RL approaches in healthcare and contributes to both ML methodology (MOPBRL) and practical healthcare applications."
