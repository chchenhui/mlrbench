    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the task (MoEs, quantization, hardware, inference) and the specific goal of bridging these areas. The methodology clearly implements the research idea of dynamic mixed-precision quantization using RL and hardware feedback. It acknowledges and builds upon the cited literature (MiLo, MC-MoE, MoQa), positioning itself within the current research landscape and aiming to tackle identified challenges like adaptive allocation and hardware efficiency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, three-stage methodology, and experimental design are presented logically and with sufficient detail. Mathematical formulations are included to clarify parts of the methodology. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact implementation details of the RL state/reward or the complexity of the differentiable hardware proxies, but the overall proposal is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While mixed-precision quantization for MoEs exists (MC-MoE, MoQa), the specific combination of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for dynamic bit-width allocation, incorporating direct hardware-in-the-loop feedback into the RL reward, and proposing joint optimization (co-design) of the MoE architecture and quantization scheme during training offers a fresh perspective. This synthesis of RL, hardware feedback, and co-design distinguishes it from prior work cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established principles of MoEs, quantization, RL (PPO), and hardware modeling. The rationale for linking precision to expert usage/importance is logical. The methodology stages are well-conceived. However, the reliance on potentially simplified differentiable proxies for hardware metrics (like the basic latency model shown) might be a minor weakness in rigor. The successful implementation of hardware-in-the-loop RL and stable co-design requires careful execution but is theoretically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating RL with hardware-in-the-loop (simulated or real) is complex and requires substantial engineering effort. Training the RL policy effectively and ensuring the stability of the co-design process (jointly optimizing architecture and quantization) are non-trivial. Access to diverse hardware/simulators (Jetson, TPU, Gem5) is required. While achievable for a well-resourced team, the technical complexity and ambitious integration pose considerable risks to achieving the stated goals within a typical project timeframe."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of efficient inference for large MoE models, a major bottleneck for their widespread deployment. Achieving the targeted 2-3x speedup and 40% memory reduction with minimal accuracy loss would be a substantial contribution, enabling MoE usage in resource-constrained environments (edge) and reducing costs in the cloud. The focus on hardware-algorithm co-design also aligns with important trends in sustainable and efficient AI."
