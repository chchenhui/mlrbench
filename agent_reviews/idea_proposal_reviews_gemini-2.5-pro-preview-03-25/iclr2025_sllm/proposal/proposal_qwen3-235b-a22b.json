    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on MoEs, quantization, hardware efficiency, and inference by proposing a method that integrates these aspects. It elaborates clearly on the research idea of dynamic mixed-precision quantization for MoEs. Furthermore, it positions itself effectively within the context of the provided literature, citing relevant recent works (MiLo, MC-MoE, MoQa, MoQE) and identifying key challenges (accuracy degradation, adaptive allocation, hardware issues) that it aims to tackle. The proposed methodology directly targets the synergy between sparsity (MoE), quantization, and hardware awareness called for in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, challenges, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically. The core idea of dynamic mixed-precision quantization driven by RL and hardware awareness is explained well. The methodology section breaks down the approach into understandable components (Expert Importance, RL Allocation, QAT, Hardware Co-Design). Mathematical formulations are provided for key concepts. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of 'gradient-based sensitivity' and a potentially confusing/simplified presentation of the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) gradient formula. However, these do not significantly detract from the overall understanding of the proposed work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While mixed-precision quantization and MoE optimization exist (as shown in the literature review with MC-MoE and MoQa), the specific combination of *dynamic*, *per-expert* bit-width allocation driven by a *reinforcement learning* policy trained with *hardware-in-the-loop* simulation appears novel. This contrasts with cited works focusing on static allocation (MoQa), training-free LP-based allocation (MC-MoE), uniform low-bit quantization (MoQE), or low-rank compensation for uniform quantization (MiLo). The integration of RL for hardware-aware, expert-specific quantization policy learning is a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established concepts like MoEs, quantization (including QAT), RL, and hardware performance modeling. The rationale for using expert importance metrics (frequency, sensitivity) and RL for optimization is logical. The use of QAT to maintain accuracy is appropriate. Hardware simulation for co-design is a valid approach. However, the technical formulation for the STE gradient seems potentially inaccurate or at least unclearly presented (`gradient = dL/dW_quant if |W| <= scale else 0` is not the standard STE definition). While the overall methodology is robust, this specific technical detail requires clarification or correction, slightly impacting the perceived rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial expertise across MoEs, quantization, RL, and hardware modeling. Training large MoEs with QAT is computationally expensive. Training an RL agent, especially with hardware simulation potentially in the loop for reward calculation, adds significant complexity and computational overhead. Convergence and stability of the RL training are potential risks. Access to large datasets, powerful compute resources (GPUs/TPUs), and target hardware for evaluation (A100, M2) is necessary. While conceptually implementable with existing tools (PyTorch, Ax, simulators), the integration and scale pose considerable practical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of deploying extremely large MoE models efficiently, which is a major bottleneck for their widespread adoption. Achieving the projected 2-3x speedup and 40% memory reduction with minimal accuracy loss would represent a major advancement in hardware-efficient AI. The work has strong potential to enable the use of powerful MoE models on resource-constrained edge devices and reduce the operational costs and environmental impact of large models in the cloud. Its focus on co-designing algorithms and hardware considerations aligns well with future trends in efficient deep learning."
