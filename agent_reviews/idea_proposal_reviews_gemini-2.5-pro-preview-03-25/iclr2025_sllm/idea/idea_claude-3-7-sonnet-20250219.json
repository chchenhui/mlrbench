        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses key topics mentioned, including Mixture of Experts (MoEs), Quantization, and LLM Inference efficiency. It explores the interaction between MoE structure (a form of sparsity) and quantization, fitting the workshop's goal of fostering connections between related research areas. The focus on reducing computational demands during inference for large models like MoEs is central to the workshop's theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (high cost of MoEs, limitations of uniform quantization) is explicitly stated. The proposed solution (dynamic, factor-based per-expert quantization) is clearly articulated, including the factors considered (utilization, importance, resources) and the mechanism (meta-controller, varying precision levels). The inclusion of quantization-aware router training further clarifies the approach. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While quantization for MoEs exists, the proposed dynamic, adaptive approach where precision is assigned per expert based on real-time utilization, task importance, and system resources is innovative. Standard methods often apply static or uniform quantization. The concept of a meta-controller adjusting quantization levels during inference and the specific quantization-aware router training tailored for this dynamic setup represent fresh perspectives in MoE optimization."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Core techniques like quantization (various bit levels) and activation monitoring are established. However, implementing a lightweight, low-overhead meta-controller and efficiently switching quantization levels dynamically during inference could require significant engineering effort and potentially specialized hardware/software support. Determining 'task-specific expert importance' robustly also needs careful design. The quantization-aware training adds complexity. While preliminary results suggest viability, practical deployment requires overcoming these hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. MoE architectures are crucial for scaling state-of-the-art LLMs, but their inference cost is a major barrier. Achieving substantial memory reduction (claimed 60-70%) with minimal performance degradation (claimed 98% retention) would be a major advancement, significantly improving the deployability and accessibility of large MoE models. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the practical application of cutting-edge AI models."
