        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task focuses on sparsity in deep learning, specifically mentioning Mixture of Experts (MoEs), Quantization, LLM inference, and the interaction between these areas as key topics. The research idea directly addresses the intersection of MoEs and Quantization to improve LLM inference efficiency, fitting squarely within the workshop's scope and aims, particularly the goal of fostering connections between related research areas like MoEs and quantization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of uniform quantization for MoEs), the core proposal (dynamic quantization based on router confidence), the mechanism (high confidence -> low precision, low confidence -> high precision), and the evaluation plan (comparison against static baselines on standard MoEs/benchmarks). The concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While dynamic quantization and MoEs exist independently, the specific approach of using the MoE router's confidence score (or entropy) as the dynamic criterion to adjust quantization precision for selected experts appears novel. It proposes a specific synergy between the routing mechanism and the quantization strategy, going beyond standard static or generic dynamic quantization methods applied to MoEs. It offers a fresh perspective on optimizing MoE models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. Accessing router confidence scores is straightforward. Quantizing models to different bit-widths is standard. However, implementing the *dynamic* switching of precision based on token-level router confidence during inference requires careful engineering. It might necessitate custom compute kernels or modifications to existing inference frameworks to handle variable precision efficiently without introducing significant latency overhead. While conceptually sound and achievable in a research context, optimizing it for practical, low-latency deployment could be moderately complex."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. MoE models are increasingly important for scaling LLMs, but their large parameter count remains a challenge. Improving the efficiency-accuracy trade-off for MoE quantization directly addresses this critical bottleneck. If successful, this approach could enable the deployment of larger or more accurate MoE models under resource constraints, or reduce the operational cost of existing ones, representing a meaningful contribution to efficient AI."
