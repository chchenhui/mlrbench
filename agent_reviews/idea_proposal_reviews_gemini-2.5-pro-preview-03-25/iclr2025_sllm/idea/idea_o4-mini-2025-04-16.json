        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed: Mixture of Experts (MoEs), Parameter Sparsity/Pruning, and Interaction with Quantization and Distillation. It focuses on improving LLM inference efficiency, a central theme of the workshop. Furthermore, it aims to unlock synergies between quantization and sparsity, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of fostering connections between related research areas. The mention of potential benefits for modularity also fits the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (MoE memory/bandwidth issues), the core proposal (jointly learned per-expert quantization and sparsity), the methods (differentiable relaxations, resource penalty, gating dispatch, KD), and the expected outcomes (3x speed, 5x memory, <1% accuracy loss) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It provides a strong understanding of the proposed research direction."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While quantization and sparsity are individually applied to MoEs, the proposed *joint* optimization of *per-expert learnable* bitwidths and sparsity masks using differentiable techniques (Gumbel-softmax for bits, L0 for sparsity) represents a novel approach. Integrating this with the gating mechanism to dispatch configurations during inference adds another layer of innovation. It's a fresh combination and refinement of existing concepts tailored specifically for MoE efficiency."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using existing deep learning frameworks and optimization techniques (differentiable relaxations, KD). However, achieving the claimed performance gains (3x speed, 5x memory) heavily relies on the successful implementation of efficient 'mixed-precision sparse kernels' that can handle dynamically dispatched bit-width and sparsity configurations per expert. This low-level kernel optimization might pose significant engineering challenges or depend on specific hardware capabilities, making the practical realization potentially difficult, though the core algorithmic concepts are sound."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. MoEs are a key architecture for scaling large models, but their memory and inference costs are major bottlenecks. This research directly addresses this critical problem by proposing a method to substantially reduce both memory footprint and latency. If successful, it could significantly enhance the deployability of large MoE models, especially on resource-constrained hardware (edge) and reduce operational costs in the cloud, representing a major advancement in efficient AI."
