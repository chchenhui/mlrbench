        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed: Mixture of Experts (MoEs), Quantization, Hardware Innovation for Sparsity, and implicitly LLM Inference (as MoEs are common in large models). It explicitly aims to bridge MoE sparsity with adaptive quantization for hardware efficiency, fulfilling the workshop's goal of fostering connections between related areas (sparsity, quantization, hardware). The focus on inference efficiency and enabling deployment on resource-constrained hardware fits perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (MoE inference bottlenecks, limitations of static quantization). The core proposal (dynamic mixed-precision quantization per expert based on activation frequency/contribution, using hardware-aware RL, and co-design) is explained concisely. The expected outcomes are specific and measurable. Minor details about the RL policy specifics or the co-design process could be elaborated, but the overall concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While mixed-precision quantization, hardware-aware optimization, and RL for optimization exist independently, their specific combination and application here are novel. Applying dynamic, per-expert quantization based on activation frequency/contribution, optimized via hardware-in-the-loop RL specifically for MoE inference efficiency, represents a fresh approach compared to standard static or layer-wise quantization methods often applied to dense models or MoEs uniformly. The co-design aspect further adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Training MoEs, implementing mixed-precision quantization, and using RL are established techniques. However, integrating hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) optimization significantly increases complexity, requiring access to target hardware or accurate simulators within the training loop, potentially slowing down development and requiring specialized infrastructure. Efficiently implementing runtime selection and execution of variable bit-width operations per expert might also require custom kernels depending on the hardware target. Co-designing the architecture adds another layer of complexity. While achievable, it requires significant engineering effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. MoEs are a key technique for scaling state-of-the-art large models, but their inference cost (memory, latency, energy) is a major barrier to deployment. This research directly targets this critical bottleneck. Achieving the projected 2-3x speedup and 40% memory reduction with minimal accuracy loss would be a major advancement, enabling wider deployment of large MoEs, including on edge devices or more cost-effective cloud platforms. It strongly connects algorithmic innovation (sparsity-aware quantization) with practical hardware efficiency concerns."
