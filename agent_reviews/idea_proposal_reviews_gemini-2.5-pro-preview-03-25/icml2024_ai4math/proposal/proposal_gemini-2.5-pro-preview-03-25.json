    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Automated theorem generation' and the goal of human-AI collaboration in mathematics. The methodology precisely implements the core research idea (neural-symbolic RL with ATP feedback and KG guidance). Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review (validity, creativity vs. correctness, neural-symbolic integration, evaluation metrics). The objectives, significance, and methodology sections consistently build upon the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific, the components of the proposed NeuSyT-RL framework are well-defined (Generator, Validator, Constraints, KG), and the RL formulation (state, action, reward, algorithm) is explained. The overall algorithm flow is presented logically. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise implementation details of the KG integration and the novelty/interestingness metrics, but this level of detail is often refined during research execution. The structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components (neural generators, RL for proving, ATPs, KGs) exist, their synthesis into a framework specifically for *theorem generation* using RL with direct ATP validation as the reward signal, augmented by KG guidance for novelty and symbolic pre-filtering, is innovative. It moves beyond existing work focused primarily on theorem proving or generation without strong validity guarantees integrated into the learning loop. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work cited ([6, 10] on generation, [1-4, 7, 9] on proving) by combining these elements in a novel configuration aimed at generating formally verified *and* novel theorems."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (Transformers, RL, ATPs, KGs) and established methods. The core idea of using ATP verification outcomes as an RL reward signal to guide the generator towards producing valid theorems is logically sound. The inclusion of symbolic constraints as a pre-filter is a practical and sound optimization. The RL formulation is appropriate. Potential challenges like sparse rewards from ATP validation and the difficulty of defining 'interestingness' are implicitly or explicitly acknowledged. The technical approach is well-justified, though the practical effectiveness of KG guidance and novelty rewards needs empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating a neural generator, an ATP (like Lean's or Coq's), an RL framework (PPO), and a KG requires substantial engineering effort and expertise across multiple domains (ML, formal methods, graph ML). Training the RL agent might be difficult due to potentially sparse rewards (valid theorems might be rare initially) and the large action space (generating sequences). ATP calls can be computationally expensive, potentially slowing down the RL loop significantly, even with pre-filtering. Constructing a useful KG and defining effective novelty metrics are non-trivial research tasks in themselves. While the components exist, their seamless and efficient integration poses considerable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Successfully developing a system that can generate novel, formally verified theorems would be a major advancement in AI for mathematics, directly addressing a key challenge highlighted in the workshop description. It has the potential to accelerate mathematical discovery, foster human-AI collaboration, advance neural-symbolic AI, and potentially impact related fields like formal verification. The research tackles fundamental questions about machine creativity within rigorous logical frameworks. The potential contributions are substantial and clearly articulated."
