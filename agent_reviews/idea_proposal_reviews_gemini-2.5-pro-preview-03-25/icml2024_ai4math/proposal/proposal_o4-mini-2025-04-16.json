    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Automated theorem generation' topic highlighted in the task description, aiming to generate 'new and practically valid theorems'. It elaborates significantly on the core research idea, detailing the neural-symbolic RL approach. Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant recent works (e.g., Green & White 2024, QEDCartographer 2024) and explicitly aiming to tackle key challenges identified in the review, such as ensuring logical validity, balancing creativity and correctness, integrating symbolic/neural methods, and evaluation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It has a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes), well-defined objectives, and a detailed methodology broken down into stages and specific steps. Technical components like the transformer, GNN, RL formulation, and reward function are described, including some mathematical notation. The evaluation plan is specific and comprehensive. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise integration of grammar constraints during generation versus post-hoc filtering, the exact nature of the 'Symbolic Refinement' step (C.4 seems to conflate proof pruning with theorem filtering), and the specifics of reward weight tuning beyond 'grid search'. However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several existing techniques (Transformers, GNNs, RL, ATPs, grammar constraints) in a specific configuration for automated theorem generation. While RL for theorem *proving* and neural models for *conjecture generation* exist (as noted in the literature review), the application of RL (specifically PPO) with a composite reward (validity, novelty, complexity) informed by ATP feedback and GNN-based contextual information for *generating* formally valid theorems appears novel. It builds upon, but extends, prior neural-symbolic generation work (Green & White 2024) by incorporating GNN context and a detailed RL framework. The novelty lies more in the specific integration and application than in fundamentally new components."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid theoretical foundations (Transformers, GNNs, RL/PPO, ATPs, CFGs). The methodology is well-structured and logical, employing appropriate data sources (Lean, Coq, Mizar) and a relevant evaluation strategy including baselines and human assessment. The technical formulations provided (GNN context, RL objective, reward function) are standard and appear correct. Potential weaknesses include the practical challenge of efficiently integrating slow ATP calls into the RL loop, the potential superficiality of the cosine-similarity-based novelty metric, and the complexity of tuning the reward weights. The description of 'Symbolic Refinement' (C.4) could be more precise regarding its role with theorem candidates versus proofs."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the core technologies exist, integrating them efficiently poses difficulties. The primary concern is the computational cost and time required for frequent ATP calls within the RL training loop, which could make training prohibitively slow. Efficiently implementing grammar-constrained decoding and tuning the complex RL system (including the reward function) are also non-trivial. The project requires substantial computational resources and expertise across deep learning, RL, and formal methods. While ambitious, the plan is detailed, but the proposal doesn't explicitly address mitigation strategies for the likely bottleneck of ATP calls."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Automated generation of novel, formally verified mathematical theorems is a major goal in AI for mathematics and aligns perfectly with the workshop's themes. Success would represent a substantial advancement, potentially accelerating mathematical discovery by providing researchers with reliable conjectures (enhancing human-AI collaboration). The work also promises methodological contributions to neurosymbolic AI and RL for constrained generation tasks. The plan to release code and models further enhances its potential impact."
