        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key areas highlighted in the workshop summary: 'Autoformalization and the reversed auto-informalization' (core focus), 'Automated theorem generation' (through self-supervised generation from formal libraries), and implicitly 'Code augmentation and auxiliary for mathematical reasoning' (by leveraging formal libraries which are code-like). The goal of facilitating human-AI collaboration in mathematical discovery also resonates strongly with the workshop's vision."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (data scarcity, alignment), the core mechanism (dual Transformers, cycle-consistency), the data generation process (perturbing formal theorems, generating informal descriptions), and expected outcomes are well-explained. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the theorem perturbation process, the exact nature of the self-critical learning objective, and how 'plausibility' of generated informal statements is ensured, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While autoformalization, Transformers, and cycle-consistency are existing concepts, their combination in this specific manner for math formalization is innovative. Particularly novel is the self-supervised loop where formal theorems are perturbed to generate *new* informal statements, which are then used to train the autoformalizer via cycle-consistency. This approach to data augmentation and consistency enforcement in the autoformalization domain offers a fresh perspective compared to standard supervised methods or simpler back-translation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology (Transformers, large formal libraries like Lean/Coq) and methods (cycle-consistency training). However, there are moderate challenges. Ensuring the perturbed formal theorems remain meaningful and that the generated informal descriptions are plausible and semantically aligned requires careful design and validation. Training a dual-Transformer system with cycle-consistency and potentially reinforcement learning (self-critical) can be computationally expensive and complex to tune. Data availability (large formal libraries) is a plus, but the success hinges on the quality achievable in the self-supervised generation loop."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical bottleneck in AI for Math: the scarcity of parallel informal/formal data for training autoformalization systems. Successfully implementing this could substantially improve autoformalization accuracy, lowering the barrier for formalizing mathematics and potentially accelerating mathematical discovery. The generation of new conjectures, even if simple, is also a valuable contribution. It directly contributes to the goal of building AI systems that can collaborate with humans on complex mathematical tasks."
