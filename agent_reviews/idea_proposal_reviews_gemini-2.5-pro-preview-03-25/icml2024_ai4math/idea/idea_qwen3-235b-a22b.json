        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly lists 'Automated theorem generation' as a key focus area, specifically asking 'Can neural models generate new and practically valid theorems?'. This proposal directly addresses this question by outlining a method using neural models, symbolic validation (ATP), and RL to generate novel, valid theorems. It also aligns with the broader workshop goals of human-AI collaboration in mathematical discovery and touches upon related areas like neurosymbolic reasoning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly outlines the motivation, the core components of the proposed hybrid system (neural generator, ATP validator, RL framework, symbolic constraints, knowledge graph), the intended training data (formal corpora), and the evaluation strategy (metrics, human assessment). While the high-level concept is very understandable, some specific details (e.g., the exact RL formulation, the precise nature of symbolic constraints, the structure/use of the knowledge graph) could benefit from further elaboration for complete precision."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using neural networks for mathematical tasks and combining neural/symbolic approaches are existing research directions, the specific proposed synthesis is innovative. Using an ATP as an RL reward signal for *theorem generation* (as opposed to just proving), integrating symbolic constraints directly into the generation loop, and employing a knowledge graph to explicitly steer towards *novelty* represent fresh perspectives and a non-trivial combination of existing concepts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Required components like transformer models, ATPs, RL frameworks, and formal math corpora exist. However, training large models on complex formal languages is resource-intensive. Integrating the ATP efficiently into the RL loop (ATP calls can be slow) is a technical hurdle. Defining effective reward functions that capture not just validity but also novelty and 'interestingness' is difficult. Building and effectively utilizing the knowledge graph adds complexity. Evaluation involving human experts can be costly and time-consuming. Considerable engineering effort and potential algorithmic refinements would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully generating novel, formally valid mathematical theorems automatically would represent a major advancement in AI for mathematics and automated reasoning. It directly tackles a grand challenge in the field. Such a system could significantly accelerate mathematical discovery, aid mathematicians in formulating new hypotheses, and provide a powerful tool for human-AI collaboration in research, fulfilling a key vision mentioned in the task description."
