        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 theme of 'Scaling up optimization' by investigating model size-dependent hyperparameters and their relationship with optimizers, as requested in the task. The objectives and methodology perfectly reflect the research idea of deriving 'optimization-aware scaling laws'. Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to build upon key papers from the literature review (e.g., Kaplan et al., Xie et al., Fetterman et al.), positioning the work clearly within the current research landscape and addressing the identified challenges like hyperparameter transferability and computational cost."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The algorithmic steps are broken down clearly, specifying models, datasets, optimizers, and hyperparameters to be investigated. The use of mathematical notation for proposed scaling laws and SDEs adds precision. The structure is easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by aiming to synthesize empirical analysis and theoretical modeling (SDEs) to create comprehensive optimization-aware scaling laws across multiple hyperparameters and optimizers. While building directly on very recent work cited in the literature review (Xie et al. 2024 on Opt-Laws, Li et al. 2025 on empirical scaling), the proposed scope (multiple HPs like learning rate, batch size, momentum, weight decay; multiple optimizers like Adam, SGD) and the combination of empirical fitting with SDE-based theoretical grounding offer a distinct and more holistic approach than presented in individual prior works. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as the field is actively exploring this, but the proposed comprehensive investigation and synthesis represent a valuable, novel contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established concepts (scaling laws, optimization algorithms) and relevant recent theoretical work (SDEs for optimizer dynamics via Xie et al.). The methodology combines standard empirical techniques (hyperparameter sweeps) with theoretical modeling (power laws, SDEs) and robust validation plans (baselines, metrics, generalization checks). The technical formulations presented are appropriate. While the assumption of simple power-law relationships might be a simplification, the overall approach is well-justified and methodologically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant computational challenges. Conducting extensive hyperparameter sweeps for models up to 1B parameters across multiple optimizers requires substantial compute resources. However, the methods themselves (empirical sweeps, power-law fitting, SDE modeling based on prior work, regression modeling) are technically achievable with current knowledge and tools. The use of standard datasets and model architectures (Transformers) adds to feasibility. The primary risk is the availability and cost of computation, but the plan itself is realistic assuming adequate resources are secured."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in large-scale ML: the prohibitive cost and inefficiency of hyperparameter tuning during scaling. Successfully deriving optimization-aware scaling laws and providing a practical tool would lead to substantial computational savings, reduced energy consumption, and faster model development cycles. This directly aligns with the OPT 2024 focus and has the potential to democratize large model training. Furthermore, it promises valuable theoretical insights into the interplay between optimization and scaling."
