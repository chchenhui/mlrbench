    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on 'Scaling up optimization' by proposing 'optimization-aware scaling laws', explicitly tackling questions about model size-dependent hyperparameters, the influence of optimization algorithms, and the goal of reducing training costs and environmental impact. The proposal accurately reflects the research idea's motivation and main concept. It also positions itself well within the context of recent work highlighted in the literature review, aiming to extend existing scaling law research by incorporating optimizer choice more explicitly."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, significance, and overall methodology are articulated clearly. The algorithmic steps and experimental design are logical and easy to follow. The evaluation metrics are specific. Minor areas for refinement include specifying the 'fixed dataset' and potentially elaborating slightly on the expected functional form or complexity of the scaling law model f(M, θ), although acknowledging this might be part of the research discovery is reasonable. Overall, the proposal is well-structured and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has some originality but shares significant overlap with existing, very recent work identified in the literature review (e.g., Opt-Laws by Xie et al., 2024; Predictable Scale by Li et al., 2025; Efficient Hyperparameter Transfer by Green et al., 2024). These papers already explore scaling laws for hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size. The proposal's novelty seems to lie primarily in the explicit aim to *jointly* model the interactions between model size, multiple hyperparameters, *and* the choice of optimizer (Adam vs. SGD vs. RMSprop) within a unified framework, potentially offering a more comprehensive empirical study across different optimizers. However, it's more of an extension and systematic comparison rather than a groundbreaking new concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established concepts like scaling laws and empirical ML research methodology. The plan for systematic experiments, data collection, analysis using statistical/ML methods, and validation on fine-tuning tasks is rigorous. The mathematical formulation L(M, θ) = f(M, θ) + ε provides a clear starting point. However, a potential weakness is the proposed model size range (1M-100M parameters), which might be insufficient to capture scaling behavior relevant to state-of-the-art billion-parameter models, potentially limiting the soundness of extrapolating the derived laws. The complexity of interactions might also challenge the derivation of simple, robust laws."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with standard computational resources for the specified model size range (1M-100M parameters). The experimental methodology involves standard model training and analysis techniques. The main risks are practical: the potential difficulty in finding clear, generalizable scaling laws due to complex interactions, and the significant increase in resource requirements if validation or extension to much larger models (billions of parameters) is needed, which might stretch feasibility depending on available resources. Developing the 'lightweight framework' is also contingent on successfully deriving useful laws."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in modern machine learning: the immense cost and inefficiency of hyperparameter tuning for large models. Successfully deriving optimization-aware scaling laws and a framework for hyperparameter recommendation would have a substantial impact by reducing computational costs, saving researcher time, and lowering the environmental footprint of AI training. This aligns perfectly with the motivations stated in the task description and addresses a critical bottleneck in the field."
