    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 theme of 'Scaling up optimization' by investigating how optimizer hyperparameters scale with model size and optimizer type, aiming to facilitate extrapolation and reduce tuning costs, as prompted by the task description. It faithfully elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature (e.g., Xie et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025; Fetterman et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2025), positioning the work clearly within the current research landscape and aiming to extend previous findings by considering optimizer choice and multiple hyperparameters jointly."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, the methodology is broken down into logical phases with specific steps (experimental setup, scaling law derivation, validation), and the significance is well-argued. The mathematical formulations for the proposed scaling laws and the regression procedure are clearly presented. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of the 'fixed compute budget' for baseline tuning or the specifics of the 'synthetic datasets', but these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity and understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing work on scaling laws for hyperparameters (like Li et al. 2025 for LR/BS and Brown et al. 2025 for momentum), its novelty lies in proposing a *unified framework* that simultaneously models scaling for multiple key hyperparameters (LR, BS, momentum) and explicitly incorporates the *optimizer class* (AdamW vs. SGD vs. LAMB) as a factor influencing the scaling exponents. The approach of using systematic experiments and regression to derive these optimizer-specific, multi-hyperparameter laws offers a fresh perspective compared to works focusing on single hyperparameters or using different modeling techniques (like SDEs in Xie et al. 2024). It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it uses established power-law concepts, but the synthesis and specific focus are innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on established methodologies: empirical scaling law analysis (common in large model research), systematic experimentation, and standard regression techniques (nonlinear least squares with Bayesian priors for regularization). The experimental design includes varying model architectures, sizes, optimizers, and datasets. The validation plan is comprehensive, incorporating relevant baselines (including grid search and CARBS), multiple evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. The assumption of specific functional forms (power-law, log-linear) is a potential simplification but a reasonable starting point grounded in prior empirical work. The technical formulations appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but requires significant computational resources. Deriving initial hyperparameters via grid search on smaller models (e.g., 125M) is standard. However, validating the extrapolation on larger models (1.3B, 10B) necessitates access to substantial GPU compute, even without performing full grid searches at that scale. The methodology relies on standard ML libraries and techniques (PyTorch, Transformers, regression), posing no fundamental technical barriers. The main risks are the potential inaccuracy of the simple scaling law assumptions over large extrapolation ranges and the high compute cost for thorough validation. Overall, it's feasible within a well-resourced research setting typical for LLM research."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and costly bottleneck in large-scale ML: hyperparameter optimization. Developing reliable 'optimization-aware' scaling laws that allow transferring hyperparameters from small to large models would drastically reduce computational costs, training time, and the associated environmental impact. This could democratize large model training and fine-tuning. Scientifically, it promises valuable insights into the interplay between optimization algorithms, hyperparameters, and model scale in complex, high-dimensional optimization landscapes. The research directly aligns with the goals of the OPT workshop and addresses a pressing need in the ML community."
