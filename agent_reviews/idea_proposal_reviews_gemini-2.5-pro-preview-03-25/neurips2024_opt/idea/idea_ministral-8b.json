        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly focuses on 'Scaling up optimization' for LLMs and asks the specific question: 'Are there natural model size dependent learning rates that allow extrapolation from smaller models to large ones, and therefore facilitating fine-tuning?'. The proposed research directly aims to answer this question by developing model size-dependent learning rates for efficient LLM fine-tuning. It addresses the key themes of scaling laws, optimization for large models, efficiency (saving time/cost), and environmental impact mentioned in the task description. It also fits well within the listed topics like 'Adaptive Stochastic Methods', 'Deep learning optimization', and 'Scaling laws'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main idea (adaptive LR scaling with model size), methodology (data collection, analysis, algorithm development, validation), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The title accurately reflects the content. There are no significant ambiguities, making the proposal immediately understandable. Minor details, such as the specific types of statistical analyses or the exact form of the adaptive algorithm, could be further specified, but the overall concept is excellently presented."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adaptive learning rates and scaling laws are established concepts, the specific focus on creating learning rates that explicitly scale with model size *for the purpose of extrapolating fine-tuning settings* from smaller to larger models is a relatively novel approach. Much existing work focuses on pre-training scaling or finding optimal hyperparameters for fixed model sizes. This proposal combines these areas in a fresh way to address the practical challenge of efficient fine-tuning across model scales. It's not a completely new paradigm but offers a novel perspective and application within optimization for LLMs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods, but presents moderate implementation challenges. Accessing or training a diverse set of LLMs of varying sizes (Step 1) and conducting extensive fine-tuning experiments for validation (Step 4) requires significant computational resources. However, the analytical techniques (Step 2) and algorithm development (Step 3) rely on standard ML and optimization practices. Open-source models and existing deep learning frameworks can be leveraged. The primary constraint is the computational cost associated with large-scale experimentation, making it challenging but achievable for a well-resourced team."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Efficiently fine-tuning LLMs is a critical bottleneck in deploying these models widely. Finding methods to extrapolate optimal settings (like learning rates) from smaller, cheaper-to-train models to large ones could lead to substantial savings in computational cost, time, and energy consumption, directly addressing the environmental concerns mentioned in the task description. Success would provide a valuable practical tool for ML practitioners and contribute fundamental insights into optimization scaling laws for deep learning models."
