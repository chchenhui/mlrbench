    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for ML applications in compute sustainability, specifically energy/carbon-aware job scheduling. The methodology closely follows the research idea, elaborating on the state, action, reward, and algorithm. It effectively positions itself against the cited literature (CarbonClipper, PCAPS, CarbonScaler, multi-agent RL), highlighting its DRL-based holistic optimization approach as a key differentiator from heuristic or rule-based methods. It acknowledges the challenges identified in the literature review and proposes a framework to tackle them."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The state representation, action space, reward function, and choice of algorithm (PPO) are clearly specified, including relevant mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including baselines and metrics, is well-described. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the core research plan."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While RL for scheduling exists, the novelty lies in applying a specific DRL algorithm (PPO) to holistically optimize for energy cost, carbon emissions, and SLA adherence simultaneously, integrating dynamic pricing/carbon data and multiple control actions (assignment, power capping, migration, delay). This contrasts with the cited heuristic/rule-based approaches (CarbonClipper, PCAPS, CarbonScaler) and potentially different setups in other RL work (e.g., multi-agent focus). The integration of these specific elements within a single DRL agent framework for sustainability is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages a well-established DRL algorithm (PPO) suitable for the problem type. The state, action, and reward formulation is logical for the stated objectives. The methodology includes simulation-based training and real-world validation, which is standard practice in ML for Systems. Using real workload traces and energy/carbon data adds rigor. Minor weaknesses include the lack of detail on tuning the reward weights (\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) and the inherent challenge of ensuring high simulator fidelity, but the overall technical approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate challenges. Implementing and training a DRL agent in a complex, high-fidelity data center simulator requires significant computational resources and expertise. Ensuring the simulator accurately captures real-world dynamics (power, thermal, network) is non-trivial. Integrating the trained agent into a real Kubernetes cluster involves considerable engineering effort. While the plan (simulate then deploy) is standard, the scale (10k simulated nodes) and complexity require careful execution. The risks associated with training convergence and sim-to-real transfer are present but manageable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical and timely problem of reducing the substantial energy consumption and carbon footprint of cloud data centers, which has major environmental and economic implications. The potential for 20-40% carbon reduction and 15-30% energy cost savings is impactful. Furthermore, it advances the ML for Systems field by demonstrating a sophisticated DRL application and contributes an open-source framework, directly aligning with the workshop's goals of reproducibility and advancing methodology."
