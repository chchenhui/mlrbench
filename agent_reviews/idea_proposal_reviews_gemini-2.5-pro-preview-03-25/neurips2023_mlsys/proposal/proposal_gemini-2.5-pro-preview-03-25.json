    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for ML applications in compute sustainability (energy/carbon optimization) and handling systems issues from large-scale training/serving (mentioning LLM workloads). It faithfully elaborates on the core 'GreenSched' idea, detailing the DRL approach, state/action/reward components, and evaluation strategy outlined. Furthermore, it explicitly references the provided literature, positioning itself by aiming to address the identified challenges (balancing objectives, dynamic factors, scalability, integration) through a holistic DRL framework, thus showing a deep understanding of the context and prior work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, motivation, and research objectives are explicitly stated and easy to understand. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the MDP formulation (state, action, reward), the choice of DRL algorithms, data sources, simulation environment design, and the experimental validation plan (including baselines, scenarios, metrics, and testbed validation). The structure is logical, and the language is precise, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the project's goals and approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using DRL for scheduling and considering carbon/energy are not entirely new concepts individually (as shown in the literature review), the novelty lies in the proposed *holistic integration* within a single DRL framework. Specifically, it aims to simultaneously consider dynamic energy pricing, dynamic carbon intensity forecasts, heterogeneous hardware, diverse workloads (including LLMs), and multiple control actions (placement, delay, power capping, potentially migration) for continuous online adaptation. This comprehensive approach, particularly the combination of real-time environmental factors and fine-grained power control within the DRL loop for general job scheduling including LLMs, distinguishes it from the cited works which might focus on specific aspects (e.g., spatiotemporal movement, precedence constraints, elasticity alone). The proposal clearly articulates this integrative novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. Framing the problem as an MDP and applying DRL (specifically Actor-Critic methods like PPO/SAC) is a well-established and appropriate approach for this type of sequential decision-making task in systems. The proposed state representation captures key system and environmental variables, and the action space includes relevant control levers. The reward function directly encodes the multi-objective optimization goal. The methodology includes both simulation for training/evaluation and testbed validation for assessing real-world viability, which is a rigorous approach. Minor areas like the specifics of power modeling or handling the hybrid action space could be further detailed, but the overall technical foundation is solid and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard DRL libraries, simulation techniques (discrete-event simulation), and existing technologies like Kubernetes and system monitoring tools. Publicly available data sources for workloads, energy prices, and carbon intensity are identified. The plan to start with simulation and then move to a small-scale testbed is practical. Potential challenges like DRL training complexity, sim-to-real transfer, and Kubernetes integration effort are implicitly or explicitly acknowledged (e.g., migration as optional/advanced). While ambitious, the project scope appears manageable within a typical research context, and the risks seem manageable with careful engineering and experimentation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and growing problem of energy consumption and carbon emissions in cloud datacenters, a major concern highlighted by the workshop's focus on compute sustainability. Successfully developing GreenSched could lead to substantial environmental benefits (reduced carbon footprint) and economic savings (lower energy costs) for datacenter operators. Furthermore, it advances the state-of-the-art in ML for Systems by applying DRL to a complex, dynamic, multi-objective resource management problem. The commitment to releasing an open-source framework significantly enhances its potential impact on the research community, fostering reproducibility and further innovation in sustainable computing."
