    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for ML applications in compute sustainability (energy/carbon optimization in scheduling), unifying benchmarks, and reproducibility. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the DRL approach, state/action/reward, simulator, and integration plans. Furthermore, it explicitly references and positions itself against the provided literature (CarbonClipper, PCAPS, CarbonScaler, MARL scheduling), addressing the identified challenges and proposing advancements like integrated multi-action control (scheduling, power capping, migration) driven by DRL."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, motivation, and objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology is broken down into logical phases (Formalization, Simulator, DRL, Deployment) with clear descriptions of the MDP, simulator components, DRL architecture (PPO), training protocol, and evaluation plan. The technical formulations (MDP state/action/reward) are presented clearly. The expected outcomes and impact are well-articulated. Minor points like the exact details of 'hashed state representations' could be elaborated further in a full paper, but for a proposal, the clarity is excellent."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using RL for scheduling exists (e.g., Ref [4]), the novelty lies in the proposed *unified* DRL framework that integrates job assignment, power capping, *and* VM migration, driven by dynamic energy pricing *and* spatiotemporal carbon intensity data, while optimizing a combined cost-carbon-SLA objective. This specific combination of control levers and objectives within a single adaptive DRL agent appears distinct from the cited works (CarbonClipper, PCAPS, CarbonScaler), which focus on subsets of these aspects or use different methodologies. The proposal clearly articulates this distinction. It's not introducing a fundamentally new RL algorithm but offers an innovative system design and application."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. The MDP formulation is appropriate for the problem. The choice of PPO is suitable for the complex control task. The methodology relies on established practices: simulation-based training using real-world data (traces, energy prices, carbon intensity), validation against benchmarks, and integration with standard infrastructure (Kubernetes). The DRL architecture choices (twin networks, multi-discrete heads, reward shaping) are reasonable. The evaluation metrics are relevant. Minor points include a potential typo ('Pacer [3]' likely meant CarbonScaler or PCAPS) and the need for more detail on the 'hashed state representations' and the O(N) complexity claim (presumably inference time) in a full paper. The reward weights are stated as derived from sensitivity analysis, which is a sound approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant engineering challenges. The required technologies (DRL libraries, CloudSim, Kubernetes, NVML, P-states) exist. Accessing the specified datasets seems plausible. However, building and calibrating a high-fidelity simulator, training a complex DRL agent (requiring substantial compute resources, e.g., 512 actors), and integrating the system reliably into Kubernetes with hardware control (power capping, migration) requires considerable effort and expertise. The A/B testing phase also requires access to a suitable cluster. While ambitious, the plan is generally realistic for a well-equipped research team, with manageable risks typical of complex systems projects."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of reducing the substantial energy consumption and carbon footprint of cloud datacenters, a major concern for the industry and society. The potential for significant cost savings (20-30%) and carbon reduction (35-45%) while maintaining SLAs would represent a major advancement. The project directly aligns with the workshop's focus on compute sustainability and ML for Systems. Furthermore, the commitment to releasing an open-source simulator and framework provides a valuable contribution to the research community, potentially catalyzing further work and establishing a reproducible benchmark."
