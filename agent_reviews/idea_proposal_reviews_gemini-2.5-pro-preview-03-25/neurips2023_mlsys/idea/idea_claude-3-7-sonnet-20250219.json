        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions applying ML to systems issues in large-scale training (like compiler partitioning for LLMs across many devices) and ML for compute sustainability (energy optimization), both of which are central themes of the LLMCompiler proposal. It directly addresses the key emerging areas mentioned in the workshop direction."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly. It outlines the motivation (inefficiency of current heuristics), the core concept (RL framework for partitioning), the objectives (throughput, memory, communication, energy), the learning mechanism (feedback loop from real runs), and even preliminary results. While specific RL algorithm details are omitted, the overall research direction and approach are crystal clear and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While using ML/RL for compiler optimizations isn't entirely new, applying it specifically to the complex, large-scale partitioning problem for LLM training across thousands of accelerators, with multi-objective optimization including energy, and incorporating a feedback loop from actual training runs, represents a novel and timely approach. It combines existing concepts in a new and challenging domain, offering fresh perspectives compared to traditional static heuristics."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Implementing an RL environment for massive computational graphs, defining effective state/action spaces, integrating with compiler backends, and efficiently collecting feedback from large-scale distributed runs require substantial engineering effort, computational resources (large clusters), and expertise. The mention of preliminary results suggests initial viability, but scaling and robust implementation remain challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Optimizing LLM training is a critical bottleneck in AI development, impacting cost, time, and environmental footprint. Achieving the claimed 15-25% reduction in training time and 20-30% energy savings would be a major advancement. Success would have substantial practical impact and contribute significantly to the ML for Systems field, particularly in sustainable computing and large-scale system optimization."
