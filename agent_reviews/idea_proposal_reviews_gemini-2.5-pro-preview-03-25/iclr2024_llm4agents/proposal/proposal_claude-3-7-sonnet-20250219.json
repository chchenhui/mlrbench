    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on LLM agent memory mechanisms and cognitive frameworks by proposing a biologically-inspired semantic memory architecture. The proposal fully embodies the research idea, detailing the dual-pathway memory, forgetting mechanisms, and RL optimization. It effectively situates itself within the provided literature, acknowledging related works (RecallM, MemoryBank) as baselines and addressing key challenges like balancing retention/forgetting and efficient management, which are highlighted in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the objectives. The methodology section is highly detailed, breaking down the system architecture, algorithms (including mathematical formulations for key parts like importance scoring and RL), and experimental design logically. The components, evaluation metrics, and baselines are explicitly listed. The expected outcomes are articulated concisely. There are minimal ambiguities, making the research plan immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While components like semantic networks, forgetting curves (inspired by Ebbinghaus, similar to MemoryBank), and RL exist, the novelty lies in their specific integration: a dual-pathway (episodic/semantic) architecture combined with adaptive, biologically-inspired forgetting (recency, frequency, centrality, consolidation/compression) that is dynamically optimized via reinforcement learning based on task performance and memory efficiency. This integrated approach to creating a cognitive memory architecture with learned forgetting parameters distinguishes it significantly from standard RAG, simple context extension, or the specific unlearning techniques discussed in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established concepts in cognitive science (dual-pathway memory, consolidation) and machine learning (LLM embeddings, graph networks, RL - PPO). The methodology is well-defined, with clear technical formulations for the core mechanisms (importance scoring, decay, RL objective). The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines (RecallM, MemoryBank cited in the literature), diverse metrics, ablation studies, and human evaluation. Minor potential weaknesses include the complexity of integrating all components and the potential difficulty in precisely defining and balancing the RL reward function, but the overall technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology (SOTA LLMs, graph libraries, RL frameworks) and methods. It outlines necessary resources (GPU clusters, specific software libraries). However, the integration of multiple complex systems (LLM inference/embedding, dynamic graph management, RL training loop) presents significant engineering challenges. Optimizing the RL component effectively might require substantial experimentation and tuning. The scale of the semantic network could pose computational challenges in very long interactions. While ambitious, the plan is generally realistic for a well-equipped research team, albeit with moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental limitation of current LLM agents – effective long-term memory management – which is crucial for enabling more complex, coherent, and human-like interactions over extended periods. Success would represent a major advancement in AI cognitive architectures, potentially leading to more capable personal assistants, research tools, and educational agents. The biologically-inspired approach could also offer insights relevant to cognitive science. The potential contributions to both AI capabilities and scientific understanding are substantial."
