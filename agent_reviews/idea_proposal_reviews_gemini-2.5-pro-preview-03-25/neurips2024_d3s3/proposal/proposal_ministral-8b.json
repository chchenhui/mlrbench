        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key themes of the workshop task, such as differentiable surrogates (FNO), probabilistic inverse problems, uncertainty quantification, and speeding up simulations in a relevant scientific domain (turbulent flows). The proposal meticulously expands on the provided research idea, detailing the CNO architecture, training, and evaluation. Furthermore, it tackles the core challenges identified in the literature review (high-dimensional inverse problems, UQ, efficiency) using methods related to those discussed in the reviewed papers (Neural Operators, conditional modeling)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (FNO, conditional NF, amortized VI), experimental design, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The structure is coherent. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise formulation and explanation of the conditional normalizing flow density equation, but these do not significantly hinder the overall comprehension of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the core components (FNO, Normalizing Flows, Variational Inference) are existing techniques, their specific combination into a Conditional Neural Operator (CNO) framework for probabilistic inverse modeling *in turbulent flows* represents a novel approach. The literature review highlights related work using diffusion models or neural fields, positioning this NF-based conditional operator approach as a distinct and innovative contribution within the field of ML for PDE-based inverse problems, particularly for complex systems like turbulence."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (Neural Operators, Normalizing Flows, Variational Inference) and proposes a methodologically valid approach (FNO surrogate + NF posterior + Amortized VI) for the target problem. The use of synthetic Navier-Stokes data for training is a standard and justified practice in this area. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are appropriate. The technical formulations presented are standard, although brief."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant computational demands. Generating sufficient high-quality Navier-Stokes simulation data and training the combined FNO and conditional normalizing flow models will require substantial HPC resources. The required technologies (FNO, NF, VI libraries) are available, but successful implementation demands considerable expertise in both ML and fluid dynamics. While the plan is realistic, the computational cost and potential challenges in training stability and generalization from synthetic data represent manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical challenges in turbulent flow modeling: efficient and accurate inverse problem solving and uncertainty quantification. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in fields relying on turbulence simulation, such as aerodynamics, climate science, and engineering design, by providing a fast, differentiable, and uncertainty-aware tool. The potential contributions are substantial and align perfectly with the goals of applying advanced ML to scientific discovery."
