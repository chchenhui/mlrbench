    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric ML, specifically 'model-assisted dataset construction', 'quality signals', and 'ethical considerations' for foundation models in new domains (biomedical, climate science). It faithfully translates the core research idea (iterative, diversity-aware feedback loops) into a concrete plan. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as bias amplification in feedback loops (Wyllie et al., Taori et al.) and the need for fairness-aware data generation (Erfanian et al.). The methodology directly incorporates concepts like feedback loops and synthetic data generation discussed in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific and measurable (e.g., reduce annotation costs by 30-50%). The methodology section provides a logical flow with a framework overview and detailed algorithmic steps, including relevant mathematical formulations. The experimental design is well-defined with specified datasets, baselines, and metrics. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact nature and origin of the 'reference model' (f_{\\\\text{ref}}) used for the quality score and the precise mechanism for translating ethical monitoring into actionable changes within the loop. However, these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity and understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts (model-assisted construction, active learning, synthetic data generation, feedback loop analysis, fairness metrics) into a novel, cohesive framework focused on *diversity-aware* dataset construction. While individual components are not entirely new, their specific combination within an iterative loop that uses latent space diversity to guide generation and active learning is innovative. It moves beyond simply identifying bias in feedback loops (as in Wyllie et al., Taori et al.) or general fairness augmentation (Erfanian et al.) by proposing a proactive, adaptive system for building diverse datasets from the ground up. The novelty lies in the specific architecture and objective of the feedback loop."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established machine learning techniques like contrastive learning, k-means clustering, diffusion models for generation, and active learning (uncertainty/diversity sampling). The mathematical formulations presented are appropriate for the described steps. The rationale for using latent space analysis for diversity and combining uncertainty/diversity for sampling is logical. The proposed metrics (entropy, consistency, demographic parity) are relevant. A minor weakness is the lack of detail regarding the 'reference model' for the quality score, which requires further specification for full rigor. The assumption that latent space clusters effectively capture all relevant diversity aspects might need domain-specific validation, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing and accessible technologies (foundation models like ViT/Transformers, diffusion models, standard clustering/active learning algorithms). The plan is concrete, outlining iterative cycles and target datasets (CheXpert, ERA5) that are available. The goal of reducing annotation costs acknowledges resource constraints. Potential challenges include ensuring the quality and diversity of synthetic data, the effectiveness of the active learning strategy in practice, and the potential for unforeseen bias amplification despite monitoring. However, these are standard research risks in ML, and the proposed methodology appears implementable with appropriate computational resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in modern machine learning: the creation of large-scale, high-quality, diverse, and ethically sound datasets, particularly for specialized domains lacking abundant labeled data. Success would lead to more efficient dataset construction, potentially enabling the use of powerful foundation models in crucial areas like climate science and healthcare. By explicitly incorporating diversity and bias mitigation into the construction process, it contributes directly to the development of more robust and equitable AI systems. The plan to open-source the framework further enhances its potential impact on the research community, aligning well with data-centric AI initiatives."
