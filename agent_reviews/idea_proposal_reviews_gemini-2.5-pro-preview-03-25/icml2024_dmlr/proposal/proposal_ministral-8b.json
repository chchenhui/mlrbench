        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric ML, specifically model-assisted dataset construction, quality signals, and ethical considerations for foundation models in new domains. The methodology precisely follows the research idea, detailing the iterative framework with diversity-aware feedback loops. Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as bias amplification in feedback loops (Wyllie et al., Taori & Hashimoto) and the need for quality in synthetic data (Erfanian et al.), positioning the work effectively within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is broken down into logical stages with detailed steps. The evaluation plan, including metrics and experimental design, is outlined. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details (e.g., exact clustering algorithms, specific generative models, precise formulation of diversity metrics), but this level of detail is often acceptable for a proposal. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like model-assisted data generation, active learning, and diversity metrics exist, the novelty lies in their integration into a cohesive, adaptive framework specifically driven by *diversity-aware* feedback loops. Using foundation models to identify underrepresented patterns via latent embeddings and then iteratively refining the dataset based on continuous diversity and quality metrics, coupled with active learning for validation, presents a fresh perspective compared to prior work focusing mainly on bias amplification or fairness augmentation alone. The emphasis on proactively enhancing diversity through this specific loop mechanism is a key innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established ML concepts (foundation models, generative models, active learning, clustering). The proposed iterative methodology is logical. It demonstrates awareness of related work and challenges like bias amplification. However, some technical details lack full specification (e.g., choice of specific algorithms/metrics), which slightly limits the assessment of full technical rigor at this stage. The crucial step of ensuring that clustering latent embeddings reliably identifies *meaningful* underrepresented patterns needs strong empirical validation. The claimed 30-50% cost reduction is ambitious and requires robust justification through experiments."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current technology and methods. Foundation models, generative techniques, and active learning frameworks are accessible. However, implementation requires significant computational resources and access to human annotators for the validation loop, which could be a bottleneck or increase costs despite the aim for reduction. Potential challenges include ensuring the quality of synthetic data, the effectiveness of the active learning strategy in reducing annotation effort significantly, and the difficulty in defining and optimizing robust diversity metrics. The risks are manageable but require careful planning and execution."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely challenge of constructing high-quality, diverse datasets efficiently, which is a major bottleneck for training robust and fair foundation models, especially in new or niche domains as highlighted by the workshop scope. Success would lead to substantial contributions by improving model robustness, reducing annotation costs, and promoting ethical data practices through explicit bias monitoring. The focus on data-centric AI aligns perfectly with current research trends and practical needs in the field."
