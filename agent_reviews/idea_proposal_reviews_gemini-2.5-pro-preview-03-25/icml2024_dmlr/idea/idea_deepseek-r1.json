    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea aligns excellently with the workshop's scope and topics. It directly addresses 'Model-assisted dataset construction', incorporates 'Quality signals' (diversity, consistency), targets 'Datasets for specific applications' (emerging domains like climate science, robotics, biomedical imaging), and touches upon 'Ethical considerations' (bias monitoring). The focus on improving dataset diversity and quality for foundation models in new domains is central to the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (initial training, synthetic generation via embeddings, active learning validation, continuous metrics), and expected outcomes are well-defined. The concept of 'diversity-aware feedback loops' is central and understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific algorithms for clustering or active learning, but the overall framework is presented clearly."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like model-assisted construction, active learning, and synthetic data exist, the proposed integration into an iterative framework specifically driven by *adaptive diversity metrics* (identified via latent space clustering and continuously monitored) offers a fresh perspective. The emphasis on a continuous feedback loop explicitly optimizing for diversity distinguishes it from methods focusing solely on scale or basic quality checks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current ML techniques. It leverages existing concepts like foundation models, clustering, active learning, and synthetic data generation. However, implementation requires significant engineering effort, access to potentially large models and compute resources, and human annotators for validation. Defining robust and generalizable diversity metrics, especially across different domains, presents a notable challenge. The iterative nature could also be computationally intensive."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. It addresses the critical challenge of creating high-quality, diverse datasets efficiently, particularly for emerging domains where data is often a bottleneck. Improving dataset diversity can lead to more robust, fair, and generalizable foundation models. The potential for substantial annotation cost reduction (30-50%) and the explicit inclusion of bias monitoring during construction further enhance its significance."
