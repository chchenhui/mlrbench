        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The ACDE idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on data-centric machine learning for foundation models. It directly addresses several listed topics, including 'Model-assisted dataset construction', 'Quality signals for large-scale datasets', 'Data curation and HCI', and implicitly touches upon 'Ethical considerations' through its goal of reducing bias. The motivation and proposed solution focus squarely on improving dataset quality and curation efficiency for large models, which is the core theme of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented clearly. The motivation is well-defined, outlining the problems with existing data curation methods. The main idea, combining active learning and human-AI collaboration, is stated upfront. The core steps of the process are listed, and the concept of 'diversity probing' is introduced. While the overall concept is clear, the specific mechanism of 'diversity probing' could benefit from slightly more detail on how underrepresented patterns are identified and prioritized. However, the idea is generally well-articulated and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea integrates several existing concepts (active learning, human-in-the-loop, collaborative interfaces) in the context of foundation model dataset curation. While these individual components are not entirely new, their specific combination and application to foundation models, particularly with the introduction of 'diversity probing' focused on underrepresented patterns beyond simple uncertainty, offers notable originality. It represents a thoughtful refinement and extension of current data-centric AI practices rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed ACDE system appears largely feasible. Active learning frameworks exist, human-AI interfaces for annotation/curation are common, and feedback loops for data quality signals are implementable. The main components rely on established techniques. Potential challenges include developing a truly intuitive interface for domain experts, effectively implementing the 'diversity probing' mechanism, and ensuring access to domain experts for the collaborative part, although the system aims to minimize this dependency compared to full manual curation. Overall, it is practical with current technology and ML expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a highly significant problem in modern machine learning: the efficient creation of high-quality, diverse, and unbiased datasets for large foundation models. If ACDE can deliver on its claims (comparable performance with significantly less labeled data, reduced bias, better edge case representation), the impact would be substantial. It directly contributes to building more robust, reliable, and ethical AI systems, aligning perfectly with the goals of data-centric AI research and the workshop's emphasis on practical data challenges."
