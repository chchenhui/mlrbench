        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly lists 'Impact of dataset drifts in large-scale models' as a key topic, which this idea directly addresses. It focuses on foundation models and data-centric aspects like provenance and temporal signals, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope of data challenges for large models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of reactive drift detection) and the core proposal (proactive prediction using metadata/temporal signals, triggering adaptation) are well-explained. While specific details on the prediction models or adaptation mechanisms could be further elaborated, the overall concept is understandable and precise enough for a research proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While data drift detection and model adaptation are existing areas, the core novelty lies in the *proactive* prediction of future drifts *before* they significantly impact the model, specifically using auxiliary signals like metadata, provenance, and temporal data streams associated with incoming data. This predictive approach, rather than purely reactive detection, offers a fresh perspective on managing drift in foundation models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology. Analyzing metadata and temporal signals is practical, and developing lightweight predictive models is achievable. However, identifying truly predictive signals for future drift poses a challenge. Implementing the full loop (prediction, triggering adaptation, potential data synthesis, fine-tuning) requires significant engineering and careful validation, but it doesn't rely on fundamentally unavailable technology or methods. Moderate refinement and experimentation would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Data drift is a critical bottleneck for the reliable long-term deployment of foundation models in dynamic real-world environments. A successful proactive approach could substantially improve model robustness, reduce performance degradation, optimize maintenance efforts (e.g., targeted fine-tuning), and enhance the overall trustworthiness and utility of these powerful models, representing a major advancement."
