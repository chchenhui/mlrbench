        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea aligns excellently with the workshop's scope and topics. It directly addresses 'Model-assisted dataset construction', 'Quality signals for large-scale datasets', and 'Data curation and HCI' through its interactive dashboard. The motivation explicitly targets the need for scalable curation for foundation models, a central theme of the workshop. It also mentions fostering robust models for 'new domains', aligning with the workshop's interest beyond standard vision/language tasks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. It outlines the motivation, the core components of the MetaCurate pipeline (ensemble models, quality signals, metrics, scoring, LLM module, dashboard), and the validation strategy. The overall goal is unambiguous. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details (e.g., exact models in the ensemble, weighting function specifics), but the concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using models for data assessment isn't entirely new, MetaCurate proposes a novel integration of multiple, nuanced quality signals (semantic novelty, agreement, bias, multimodal alignment) derived from *ensembles* of foundation models. Combining this with an LLM-driven categorization suggestion and an interactive human-in-the-loop dashboard for refinement represents a fresh and comprehensive approach to automated curation, going beyond simpler heuristics or single-signal methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires access to and computation with multiple foundation models (potentially expensive), significant engineering effort to build the integrated pipeline and dashboard, and substantial resources for validation on large-scale corpora. However, the underlying techniques (model inference, metric computation, dashboard development) are within the realm of current ML and software engineering capabilities, making it achievable for a well-resourced research team."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical bottleneck of scalable, high-quality data curation, which is increasingly recognized as crucial for developing robust and reliable foundation models. By automating the integration of rich quality signals and enabling human oversight, MetaCurate could lead to substantial improvements in dataset quality, diversity, and safety (reduced bias/harmful content), ultimately advancing foundation model capabilities across various domains."
