    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for efficient, scalable fine-tuning methods, theoretical understanding, and new methodologies, particularly for resource-constrained environments. The proposal faithfully elaborates on the research idea, detailing the RGFT mechanism, objectives, and expected outcomes. It also situates the work within the context provided by the literature review, aiming to tackle the identified challenges like identifying error-prone components and dynamic resource allocation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-structured and clearly written, outlining the motivation, objectives, methodology, and expected impact. However, significant ambiguity exists in the core technical details of the methodology. Specifically, the definition of component-level residual r_i = y_i - \\\\hat{y}_i is unclear for internal components (how are y_i, \\\\hat{y}_i defined for a layer or attention head?). The construction of the error map E and the derivation/meaning of the component error contribution E_i used in the learning rate formula also lack precision. These ambiguities hinder a complete understanding of how the method works mathematically."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal's novelty appears limited based on the provided literature review. Several cited papers (e.g., 5, 7, 9) describe highly similar concepts: adaptive fine-tuning based on residual error analysis, using error maps, and focusing resources on problematic regions for efficiency. Paper 5, in particular, seems almost identical in its core idea ('Adaptive Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Residual Error Analysis'). While the specific implementation details or theoretical treatment might differ slightly, the proposal does not sufficiently articulate its unique contribution or differentiation from this existing work. The core idea of error-guided adaptive fine-tuning is presented as novel but seems well-explored in the provided recent literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal's soundness is questionable due to the lack of rigor in the technical formulation. The definition of component-level residuals (r_i) and the error map (E) is vague and potentially problematic (e.g., summing signed residuals). The derivation and meaning of E_i (component error contribution) are unclear, yet crucial for the dynamic learning rate adjustment. While the proposal mentions theoretical guarantees for convergence, it doesn't provide any details or proofs, making it difficult to assess their validity. The reliance on potentially ill-defined metrics (r_i, E_i) weakens the foundation of the proposed method. The experimental design is standard but lacks specifics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed method appears largely feasible to implement. Accessing intermediate activations or gradients for residual tracking is possible in standard frameworks. Implementing component-specific learning rates is also achievable. The main uncertainty lies in the practical effectiveness: defining 'components' and their 'error contributions' robustly, ensuring the computational overhead of tracking doesn't negate the efficiency gains, and achieving stable training with dynamic rates. While challenges exist in tuning and robust implementation, the core technical steps seem implementable with current technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research addresses a highly significant problem: improving the efficiency and scalability of fine-tuning large machine learning models. Reducing computational costs (potentially by 70% as claimed) while maintaining performance would have a substantial impact, especially for deployment on edge devices and in resource-limited settings. Success in this area would make advanced AI models more accessible and sustainable. The proposal aligns well with critical needs in the field, making the potential impact considerable."
