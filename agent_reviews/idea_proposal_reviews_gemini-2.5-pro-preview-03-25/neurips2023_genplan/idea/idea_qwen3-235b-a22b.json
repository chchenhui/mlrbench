        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (Workshop on Generalization in Planning). It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of generalization, transfer, and learning in sequential decision-making (SDM). It explicitly aims to bridge the gap between DRL and AI planning, a central motivation mentioned in the task description. Furthermore, the proposed methods (neuro-symbolic approaches, meta-learning, hierarchical policies, few-shot learning, transfer learning) map directly onto multiple specific topics listed in the call for papers, such as 'Neuro-symbolic approaches for generalization and transfer in SDM', 'Meta-learning for generalizable policies', 'Learning and representing hierarchical policies', and 'Learning for transfer and generalization in reinforcement learning'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem space (limitations of DRL and symbolic planning). The main idea concisely describes the proposed hierarchical framework, specifying the roles of the high-level symbolic planner (subtask discovery via program induction/HTN) and the low-level meta-learned policy (adaptation, task-agnostic representations). The interaction mechanism (symbolic hierarchy providing priors) and expected outcomes (sample efficiency, few-shot adaptation, cross-domain transfer) are clearly stated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like neuro-symbolic methods, meta-learning, and hierarchical RL exist, their specific integration within this framework is novel. Combining a high-level symbolic planner (potentially using program induction for abstract, composable subtasks) with a low-level *meta-learned* policy specifically designed for *cross-domain transfer* by leveraging symbolic priors represents a fresh approach. It synthesizes concepts from AI planning, DRL, meta-learning, and potentially program synthesis in a unique configuration aimed at tackling hierarchical transfer in SDM."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating symbolic planning (especially program induction or complex HTN generation) with meta-learning and neural policies is technically demanding. Challenges include: 1) Scalability and robustness of the symbolic planner/subtask discovery. 2) Designing an effective neuro-symbolic interface for passing priors and grounding abstract actions. 3) The inherent complexity and data requirements of meta-learning across diverse tasks. 4) Defining and evaluating meaningful cross-domain transfer scenarios. While based on existing research areas, the combination requires considerable engineering effort and careful experimental design, making implementation non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical open problems in AI: sample efficiency, generalization, and transferability in sequential decision-making, particularly for long-horizon tasks. Successfully bridging symbolic reasoning and deep meta-learning could lead to major advancements in creating AI agents that can learn reusable skills hierarchically and adapt rapidly to new tasks and domains with limited experience. This has profound implications for real-world applications like robotics, autonomous systems, and complex planning, where adaptability and efficiency are crucial."
