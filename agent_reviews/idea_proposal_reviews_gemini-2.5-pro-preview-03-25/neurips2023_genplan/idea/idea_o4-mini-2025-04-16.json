        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's theme. It directly addresses the core challenge of generalization, transfer, and sample efficiency in Sequential Decision Making (SDM), explicitly aiming to bridge deep reinforcement learning and symbolic AI planning approaches, which is a central goal stated in the task description. The proposal touches upon multiple specific topics listed in the call, including neuro-symbolic approaches, few-shot learning, meta-learning, learning heuristics for generalization, and representations for generalized policies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main components (symbolic graphs, meta-learned GNN, symbolic planner, MAML), their interaction, evaluation metrics, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The core concept of using a meta-learned GNN to predict heuristics for a symbolic planner to achieve few-shot generalization is immediately understandable. Minor details about the specific planner or graph construction could be elaborated, but the overall research direction is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like neuro-symbolic methods, GNNs for planning, meta-learning (MAML), and learning heuristics exist, their specific integration here is novel. Using meta-learning specifically to train a GNN to generate abstract heuristics/subgoals from symbolic task representations, which then guide a symbolic planner for few-shot adaptation across diverse SDM tasks, represents a fresh and innovative combination of existing concepts aimed squarely at the generalization problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, but presents moderate implementation challenges. GNNs, MAML, and symbolic planners are established tools. However, integrating them effectively (ensuring the GNN output is useful for the planner, managing the computational cost of meta-learning with potentially complex inner loops involving planning) requires significant expertise and computational resources. Generating sufficiently diverse task distributions representable as symbolic graphs for effective meta-learning is also a non-trivial requirement. The feasibility hinges on careful engineering and potentially significant compute power."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles fundamental and long-standing open problems in AI: sample efficiency, generalization, and transfer learning in decision-making, as highlighted in the task description. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially leading to AI agents that can learn complex behaviors much faster and adapt robustly to novel situations, with broad implications for robotics, autonomous systems, and other areas requiring intelligent control. The neuro-symbolic approach also contributes to understanding how to combine learning and reasoning."
