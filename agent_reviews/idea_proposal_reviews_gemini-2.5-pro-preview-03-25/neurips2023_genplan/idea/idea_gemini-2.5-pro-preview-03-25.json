    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of bridging deep RL (for control) and symbolic planning (for generalization and long-horizon reasoning) in sequential decision-making (SDM). It explicitly targets generalization, transfer, few-shot learning, hierarchical policies, meta-learning, and neuro-symbolic approaches, all of which are listed as key topics for the workshop. The motivation clearly echoes the workshop's preamble regarding the complementary strengths and weaknesses of RL and AI planning communities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the motivation (limitations of current RL), the proposed hierarchical structure (symbolic planner + low-level policy), the core mechanism (meta-RL for low-level policy conditioned on symbolic subgoals), and the expected outcome (few-shot generalization to new subgoals/tasks). The use of an example predicate `On(BlockA, BlockB)` aids understanding. The concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While hierarchical RL, symbolic planning integration, and meta-RL are existing concepts, the specific combination and focus are innovative. Using meta-RL specifically to train a low-level policy to rapidly adapt to *symbolic* subgoal representations for few-shot generalization is a fresh perspective. It's not proposing a fundamentally new algorithm type but rather a novel synthesis and application of existing techniques aimed squarely at the challenging intersection of symbolic reasoning, meta-learning, and few-shot transfer in SDM."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Meta-RL algorithms, deep RL policies, and symbolic planners are available tools. However, implementation poses moderate challenges: effectively conditioning neural policies on symbolic predicates, designing a suitable meta-training task distribution, ensuring robust communication between the symbolic planner and the meta-learned policy, and potentially scaling the approach. These are significant research challenges but appear tractable within the scope of current ML research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It tackles major open problems in AI: sample efficiency, generalization, transfer learning, and long-horizon planning in RL. Successfully combining the strengths of symbolic reasoning (generalizability, planning) with deep RL (robust control, learning from raw input) via meta-learning could lead to substantial advancements in creating more adaptable and capable agents, particularly in robotics and complex planning domains. It directly addresses critical limitations highlighted in the workshop description."
