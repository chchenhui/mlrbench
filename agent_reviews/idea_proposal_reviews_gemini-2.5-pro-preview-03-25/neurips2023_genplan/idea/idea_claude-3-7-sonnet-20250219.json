        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea 'Meta-CRAFT' aligns excellently with the workshop's theme of 'Generalization in Planning'. It directly addresses key topics mentioned in the task description, including generalization and transfer in sequential decision-making (SDM), few-shot learning, meta-learning for generalizable policies, learning hierarchical policies (via compositional reasoning), bridging reinforcement learning (sample efficiency issues) and planning (generalizability focus), and potential application in robot planning. The motivation explicitly mentions the limitations of current RL and planning approaches, mirroring the workshop's background description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the main idea is explained concisely. It outlines the core concept (meta-learning for compositional reasoning in few-shot SDM) and the proposed architecture's components (skill encoder, compositional reasoning module, meta-adaptation). The distinction between learning compositional structures versus just parameter initialization is highlighted. While specific algorithmic details of the components are not provided (which is acceptable for a research idea summary), the overall concept and goal are easily understandable with only minor ambiguities regarding the exact mechanisms."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While meta-learning and compositional reasoning are existing research areas within SDM, Meta-CRAFT proposes a specific integration: using meta-learning explicitly to learn *how* to compose skills for few-shot adaptation. This focus on learning the compositional *process* via meta-learning, rather than solely focusing on fast parameter adaptation (like MAML) or context inference, offers a fresh perspective. It combines existing concepts (meta-learning, skill extraction, compositional reasoning) in a potentially innovative way tailored for few-shot generalization in SDM."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible with current machine learning techniques. Meta-learning frameworks, methods for learning skill embeddings from demonstrations, and architectures for compositional reasoning (e.g., graph neural networks, attention mechanisms) exist. However, integrating these components effectively and designing the specific meta-learning objective to optimize for compositional structure learning might pose moderate research and engineering challenges. Generating or finding suitable task distributions for meta-training could also require significant effort. Overall, it's feasible but likely requires non-trivial implementation effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance. It targets critical open problems in AI: sample efficiency, generalization, and transfer learning in sequential decision-making. Achieving few-shot adaptation (3-5 examples) through compositional reasoning would represent a major advancement, making AI agents significantly more adaptable and data-efficient. Success could have a substantial impact on fields like robotics, automated systems, and potentially program synthesis, aligning well with the workshop's goal of fostering impactful research."
