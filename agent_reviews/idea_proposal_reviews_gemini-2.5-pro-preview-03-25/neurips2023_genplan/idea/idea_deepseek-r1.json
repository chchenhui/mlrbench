        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's theme of Generalization in Planning and Sequential Decision Making (SDM). It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the task description: bridging the gap between data-driven RL and symbolic planning to achieve generalization and transfer. The proposal explicitly incorporates multiple topics listed in the call, including neuro-symbolic approaches, meta-learning for generalizable policies, hierarchical policies, learning high-level models, generalization/transfer in robot planning, and representations for generalized plans/policies. The motivation and proposed solution directly target the synthesis of ideas from RL and planning communities sought by the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main components (symbolic planner, meta-learned neural sub-policies, formal verification), key innovations (bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, LLM-guided repair), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The use of specific terms like PDDL, meta-RL, ProcTHOR, and cross-domain robotics benchmarks adds precision. While the exact implementation details of the novel components (e.g., bi-level optimization formulation, LLM integration) are not fully specified, the overall concept and architecture are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced concepts in a unique way. While neuro-symbolic methods, hierarchical planning, and meta-learning exist individually, their proposed synthesis is innovative. Specifically, the combination of a symbolic planner with *meta-learned* sub-policies trained via *contrastive* methods for disentanglement, the *bi-level optimization* for aligning symbolic abstractions with learned capabilities, and the use of *LLMs for neuro-symbolic plan repair* represent fresh perspectives. It builds upon existing research lines but proposes a distinct architecture and learning paradigm aimed specifically at robust cross-domain generalization."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires integrating diverse techniques: symbolic planning (PDDL), deep reinforcement learning (meta-RL), formal verification, and large language models. Each component requires expertise. Key challenges include: (1) Designing and implementing the complex bi-level optimization process. (2) The computational cost and data requirements for training meta-RL policies across sufficiently diverse environments. (3) Ensuring the scalability and effective integration of the formal verification module. (4) Developing a robust mechanism for LLM-guided plan repair. While ambitious and requiring substantial resources and multi-disciplinary expertise, the approach relies on existing methods and technologies, making it plausible to implement within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant as it tackles a fundamental and critical challenge in AI: achieving robust generalization and transfer in long-horizon sequential decision-making. Success would represent a major advancement towards creating AI agents capable of adapting learned skills to new tasks and domains with minimal data, which is crucial for real-world applications like robotics and autonomous systems. By aiming to unify strengths from symbolic planning and reinforcement learning, the work could have a substantial impact on both fields and contribute to the development of more capable, adaptable, and deployable AI systems."
