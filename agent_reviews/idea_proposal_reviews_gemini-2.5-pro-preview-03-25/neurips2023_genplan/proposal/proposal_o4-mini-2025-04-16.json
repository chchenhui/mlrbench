        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of generalization, transfer, neuro-symbolic methods, hierarchical policies, and meta-learning in sequential decision-making (SDM). It faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the NSHP-Meta framework. Furthermore, it explicitly incorporates and positions itself against recent relevant works cited in the literature review (NeSyC, Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic DT, VisualPredicator) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified therein (sample efficiency, alignment, generalization, verification)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It presents a logical structure with well-defined objectives, a breakdown of the methodology into distinct components (Symbolic Planner, Neural Sub-Policies, Repair/Verification), a formal problem statement, and a detailed experimental plan. The core concepts like bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, LLM repair, and formal verification are explained conceptually. Minor ambiguities exist regarding specific implementation details (e.g., exact loss formulations for \\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{task}}, LLM fine-tuning specifics, gradient estimation for bi-level optimization), but these are acceptable at the proposal stage. The mention of a conceptual Figure 1 without its inclusion slightly detracts from full clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While neuro-symbolic methods, hierarchical planning, and meta-learning are existing areas, the specific combination and integration proposed here are novel. Key innovative aspects include: 1) The bi-level optimization scheme specifically designed to align learnable symbolic abstractions (\\phi) with meta-learned neural sub-policy capabilities (\\theta). 2) The application of contrastive meta-learning within this neuro-symbolic hierarchy to explicitly disentangle task-invariant and task-specific features for improved zero-shot transfer. 3) The integration of an LLM-guided plan repair mechanism coupled with formal verification (SMT) within the execution loop. This synthesis of techniques, particularly the optimization and learning strategies, distinguishes it from the cited recent works."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations from symbolic planning (PDDL), reinforcement learning (meta-RL), representation learning (contrastive methods), formal methods (SMT solvers), and large language models. The proposed methodology, combining these elements to leverage their complementary strengths, is logically coherent. The problem formulation is mathematically defined. The core mechanisms (bi-level optimization, contrastive loss, SMT checks) are conceptually sound approaches for their intended purposes (alignment, disentanglement, safety). Some technical details regarding the practical implementation and stability of the bi-level optimization or the reliability of LLM repair require further elaboration, but the overall approach is well-justified and technically plausible."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While individual components (symbolic planner, meta-RL agents, contrastive learning modules, LLMs, SMT solvers) are achievable with current technology, their integration into a cohesive and efficient system is complex. Bi-level optimization is known to be computationally expensive and potentially difficult to stabilize. Meta-training across diverse domains requires substantial computational resources and data. Fine-tuning and reliably integrating an LLM for plan repair adds another layer of complexity. The experimental plan involving multiple simulators (ProcTHOR, RLBench) and real-robot trials is ambitious. Success requires significant expertise across multiple AI subfields and considerable engineering effort, posing moderate risks to timely completion."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of generalization and transfer in sequential decision-making, a major bottleneck for deploying AI agents in complex, dynamic real-world environments like robotics and logistics. By aiming to unify symbolic planning's structure with deep RL's adaptability via meta-learning and ensuring safety through formal verification, the research has the potential to lead to major advancements. Success would yield agents capable of zero-shot or few-shot adaptation to unseen tasks, improve sample efficiency, and enhance safety, making substantial contributions to AI planning, RL, and robotics. The expected outcomes, if achieved, represent a significant step forward."
