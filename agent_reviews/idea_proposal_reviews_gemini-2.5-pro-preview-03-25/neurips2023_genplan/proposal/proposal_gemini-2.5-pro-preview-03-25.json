        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on generalization in planning, the synthesis of RL and symbolic methods, sample efficiency, long-horizon tasks, neuro-symbolic approaches, and meta-learning. The proposal meticulously expands on the core research idea, detailing the neuro-symbolic hierarchy, meta-learned sub-policies, bi-level optimization, contrastive learning, and LLM repair concepts. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the provided literature review (sample efficiency, alignment, cross-domain generalization, verification, computational complexity), often referencing the cited works (NeSyC, Baheri & Alm, VisualPredicator) appropriately. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all tightly linked back to these initial inputs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and evaluation plan are presented logically. Key concepts like the MeNeSyH framework, contrastive meta-RL, bi-level optimization, and plan repair are explained. The interaction flow is clearly described. However, some technical details, particularly regarding the precise implementation of the bi-level optimization solver and the exact architecture or regularization method for achieving representation disentanglement (z_{inv}, z_{spec}), remain somewhat high-level, which is common in proposals but leaves minor room for ambiguity. The LLM interaction for plan repair is also described conceptually but lacks specific prompting details. Overall, the proposal is easily understandable for an expert in the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the high-level idea of combining symbolic planning with neural policies (NeSy) exists in the literature (e.g., cited works like Baheri & Alm, NeSyC), this proposal introduces several novel elements. The core novelty lies in the specific combination and formulation: (1) Using *meta-RL* specifically for the sub-policies to enable rapid adaptation and cross-domain generalization within the NeSy hierarchy. (2) The proposed *contrastive meta-learning objective* designed explicitly to disentangle task-invariant and task-specific representations for improved generalization in this context. (3) The *bi-level optimization* formulation aimed at co-adapting the symbolic action schemas and the meta-learned sub-policies for better alignment. (4) The exploration of *LLMs specifically for neuro-symbolic plan repair* based on execution failures. These specific mechanisms, particularly their integration, offer fresh perspectives distinct from prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in symbolic planning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and neuro-symbolic AI. The proposed methodology integrates established techniques (PDDL, heuristic search, meta-RL algorithms like MAML/ProMP, contrastive loss like InfoNCE) in a principled manner. The mathematical formulation for the contrastive loss is provided, and the concept of bi-level optimization for alignment is well-motivated. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges, such as the computational cost of bi-level optimization and the need for empirical validation of the contrastive learning hypothesis, which demonstrates rigor. The inclusion of lightweight formal verification at the symbolic level is appropriate. Minor weaknesses include the inherent difficulty of guaranteeing the effectiveness of the novel contrastive objective and the practical challenges of solving the bi-level optimization problem robustly."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the required components (simulators like AI2-THOR, meta-RL algorithms, symbolic planners, LLMs) are available, integrating them into a cohesive and functional system is complex. The bi-level optimization aspect is particularly challenging; finding stable and efficient solutions is non-trivial and computationally expensive, potentially limiting scalability. Training the contrastive meta-RL objective effectively requires careful tuning and substantial diverse data. Integrating LLM-based repair reliably also poses practical hurdles. While the plan is generally realistic on paper and uses existing tools, the sheer complexity of integrating and optimizing all moving parts makes successful execution demanding and carries considerable risk. It requires significant engineering effort and expertise across multiple domains."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in AI: achieving robust generalization and sample efficiency in complex sequential decision-making tasks, particularly across different domains. This is a central challenge highlighted by the workshop description and a major goal for creating more capable and adaptable AI systems, especially in robotics and autonomous agents. Successfully bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and data-driven learning with the proposed methods (meta-learning, alignment, repair) would represent a major advancement. The potential contributions include not only improved performance on challenging benchmarks but also novel methodologies (contrastive meta-RL for NeSy, bi-level alignment) relevant to the broader AI/ML community. The focus on interpretability and robustness further enhances its significance."
