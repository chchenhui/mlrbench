    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop on Generalization in Planning), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses key workshop themes like generalization, transfer, sequential decision-making, bridging RL and planning, neuro-symbolic methods, meta-learning, and hierarchical policies. It faithfully expands on the core research idea, detailing the neuro-symbolic hierarchy, meta-learned sub-policies, bi-level optimization, contrastive learning, and formal verification. It also acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review (sample efficiency, alignment, generalization, verification). The only minor inconsistency is the omission of the 'LLM-guided refinement' mentioned briefly in the research idea summary, but this doesn't significantly detract from the overall strong consistency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The research objectives are explicitly listed and easy to understand. The hierarchical architecture, bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, and formal verification components are explained with reasonable detail, including mathematical formulations. The experimental design is well-structured with clear metrics, benchmarks, baselines, and ablation studies. The overall structure is logical. Minor areas for refinement could include more specific details on the implementation of the formal verification module (e.g., types of LTL properties, runtime monitor specifics) and the exact nature of state/sub-goal representations for policies, but the core concepts are conveyed effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like neuro-symbolic architectures, meta-RL, contrastive learning, and formal verification exist, their specific integration within the proposed SYMERA framework is novel. Key innovative aspects include: 1) The combination of a symbolic planner with meta-learned sub-policies specifically trained for fast adaptation. 2) The proposed bi-level optimization scheme to explicitly align symbolic action schemas with neural policy capabilities. 3) The use of contrastive meta-learning to disentangle task-invariant and task-specific representations within the hierarchical policy structure. 4) The integration of a formal verification layer with meta-learned policies for safety. This combination distinguishes it from the cited recent works (NeSyC, Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer, VisualPredicator) which have different focuses or technical approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established foundations in symbolic planning, meta-RL (MAML), contrastive learning, and formal methods. The hierarchical architecture is a logical approach for complex tasks. The mathematical formulations for the optimization and learning objectives appear correct. The methodology addresses key challenges like alignment and generalization in a principled way. However, the practical realization of the bi-level optimization (potential for instability or high computational cost, as noted in the literature review) and the effective integration and scalability of the formal verification module with adaptive neural policies present potential weaknesses that prevent a higher score. The assumption that symbolic schemas can be effectively optimized based purely on empirical policy performance needs strong empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires expertise across multiple complex domains (planning, meta-RL, contrastive learning, formal methods). The integration of these components into a single cohesive system is non-trivial. The bi-level optimization and meta-learning aspects are computationally intensive. While relying on existing technologies, the overall complexity raises concerns about the practicality of implementing and debugging the full system within a typical project timeframe. There are considerable risks associated with the stability of the optimization, the effectiveness of the alignment and disentanglement, and the scalability of the verification module. Successful execution requires substantial resources and a highly skilled team."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical and long-standing problem of cross-domain generalization in sequential decision-making, a major bottleneck for deploying AI systems in the real world. Successfully developing SYMERA could lead to major advancements by bridging symbolic planning and RL, improving sample efficiency and generalization, and enhancing AI safety through verification. The potential contributions to neuro-symbolic AI, meta-learning theory, and verified AI are substantial. Practical applications in robotics, personal assistants, and other domains are clearly articulated and highly relevant."
