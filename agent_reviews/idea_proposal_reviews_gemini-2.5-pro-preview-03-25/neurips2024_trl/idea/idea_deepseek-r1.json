        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes, specifically 'Multimodal Learning' by proposing joint embedding of tables and text, 'Representation Learning for (semi-)Structured Data' through its contrastive learning framework and transformer-based encoders, and 'Applications of TRL models' by targeting tasks like text-to-SQL, table QA, and data cataloging. The focus on bridging the gap between structured data (tables) and unstructured context (text) using pre-training techniques fits squarely within the workshop's scope."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, core concept (cross-modal contrastive learning), proposed architecture components (table/text encoders), training data sources (web-scale pairs), learning objective (contrastive loss), and evaluation plan (downstream tasks, baselines) are explicitly stated and easy to understand. There are no significant ambiguities in the proposal's description."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. While cross-modal contrastive learning is a well-established technique (e.g., CLIP) and its application to table-text data has been explored in prior work (e.g., TURL, UniTabE, StrcutBERT), the proposal suggests applying it at web-scale with specific architectural choices (transformer for tables, LM for text). The novelty lies more in the potential scale, specific implementation details, and the combination of elements rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm. It builds upon existing concepts in the table representation learning field."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Transformer architectures for tables and text, as well as contrastive learning frameworks, are well-understood and widely used. Web-scale table-text data exists, although collection, cleaning, and processing present significant engineering challenges. Pre-training such models requires substantial computational resources (GPU time, memory), which is standard for large-scale representation learning but needs to be acknowledged. Evaluation benchmarks for the mentioned downstream tasks are available. Overall, implementation is practical with adequate resources and engineering effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Effectively aligning table representations with natural language text addresses a critical bottleneck in many data-intensive applications, including semantic search over databases, data discovery, question answering over tables, and data integration. Improvements in these areas could lead to meaningful advancements in how users interact with and leverage structured data in enterprise, scientific, and web domains. Success would represent a valuable contribution to the field."
