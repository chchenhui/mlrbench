    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key workshop topics like 'Generative Models and LLMs for Structured Data' (LLM generation, multi-agent systems, RAG), 'Applications' (synthetic data generation, validation), and 'Challenges' (privacy, domain-specific issues). It faithfully expands on the core research idea of SynthTab, detailing the multi-agent architecture, constraint focus, and privacy integration. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself within the provided literature, citing relevant works (HARMONIC, TabuLa, DP papers, etc.) and aiming to address identified gaps like constraint ignorance and the privacy-utility trade-off. The methodology directly tackles the key challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as schema compliance and privacy preservation."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed and easy to understand. The methodology is broken down into logical stages (RAG LLM, Schema Validation, Quality Assessment, DP) with specific techniques, algorithms (LLaMA-3 fine-tuning, permutation strategy, JSD, DP mechanisms), and even prompt examples provided. The experimental design is detailed, outlining datasets, baselines, metrics, and validation procedures. The significance and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. While the referenced Figure 1 is missing, the textual description is sufficient for understanding the workflow. Minor technical details (e.g., exact feedback mechanism) could be slightly more elaborated, but overall the proposal is exceptionally clear and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several recent advancements (LLMs for tabular data, RAG, multi-agent systems, DP) into a cohesive framework specifically designed for *constraint-aware* synthetic tabular data generation. While individual components exist in the cited literature (e.g., LLMs for synthesis like HARMONIC/TabuLa, RAG for tables, multi-agent systems, DP methods, schema-constraint models), the specific combination and application focus on enforcing complex schema/business rules via dedicated agents within an iterative refinement loop appears novel. It distinguishes itself from prior LLM synthesis work by emphasizing rigorous, multi-faceted constraint validation and integrating quality assessment feedback directly into the generation loop."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and methodologically rigorous. It builds upon established principles like LLM fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, differential privacy mechanisms (Laplace, Exponential), and standard statistical evaluation metrics (JSD, Wasserstein distance, downstream task performance). The proposed multi-agent architecture is logical, assigning specific, well-defined roles (generation, validation, assessment). The inclusion of various constraint types (data type, uniqueness, referential integrity, business rules, statistical bounds) is comprehensive. The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines, multiple evaluation dimensions (fidelity, compliance, privacy, utility), and appropriate validation techniques (cross-validation, statistical tests, ablation studies). Potential challenges exist in the practical effectiveness of the feedback loop and achieving the ambitious privacy-utility target, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current technology and resources available in a standard ML research setting (open-source LLMs, public datasets, standard libraries). However, it presents moderate implementation challenges. Integrating the multiple components (RAG, LLM, validator agent, assessor agent, DP) into a smoothly functioning pipeline requires significant engineering effort. Fine-tuning the LLM effectively for tabular data, designing robust chain-of-thought validation for complex constraints (especially business rules), implementing an effective feedback loop, and carefully calibrating DP mechanisms to meet the privacy-utility goals (\\epsilon \\leq 1.0 with <5% utility loss) are non-trivial tasks. Scalability to very large datasets or highly complex schemas might also pose challenges. While achievable, the complexity and tuning required suggest moderate risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses highly significant and practical problems: data scarcity and privacy restrictions, which are major bottlenecks in applying ML to real-world tabular data, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Generating high-fidelity synthetic data that respects complex constraints and provides privacy guarantees would be a major contribution. Success would enable safer data sharing, improve model robustness in low-data regimes, and potentially influence standards for data governance and federated learning. The work aims to advance the state-of-the-art in synthetic data generation by tackling the critical but often overlooked aspect of constraint compliance alongside fidelity and privacy, thus having high potential impact."
