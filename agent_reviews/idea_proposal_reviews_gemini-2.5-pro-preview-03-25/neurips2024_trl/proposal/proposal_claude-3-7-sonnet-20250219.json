    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key workshop topics like 'Generative Models and LLMs for Structured Data', 'multi-agent systems', 'retrieval-augmented generation', 'tabular data generation', and 'handling data privacy'. The methodology comprehensively expands on the core concepts outlined in the research idea (LLM, multi-agent, schema validation, quality assessment, privacy, RAG). Furthermore, it explicitly aims to tackle the challenges identified in the literature review, such as schema compliance, privacy preservation, and capturing complex dependencies, by integrating relevant techniques discussed in the reviewed papers (e.g., LLMs for tables, DP, schema constraints, multi-agent systems, RAG)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Research objectives are explicitly listed. The multi-agent architecture, individual agent responsibilities, data processing steps, generation strategy, validation checks, quality metrics, privacy mechanisms, and experimental design are all articulated with high precision. The inclusion of mathematical formulations and references to specific techniques (e.g., KS tests, DP-SGD, RAG prompts) enhances clarity. While minor details could always be added, the proposal is immediately understandable and leaves little room for ambiguity regarding the core plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several recent advancements into a cohesive framework. While individual components like using LLMs for tabular data, schema validation, differential privacy, RAG, and multi-agent systems exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the specific *synthesis* within the SynthTab architecture is novel. The combination of a fine-tuned LLM generator with specialized agents for schema validation, quality assessment (with feedback loops), and privacy, all augmented by retrieval, represents a fresh approach. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it builds upon existing ideas, but the proposed multi-agent coordination and the emphasis on rigorous, multi-faceted validation within this structure offer clear distinctions from prior individual works."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (LLMs, multi-agent systems, differential privacy, statistical testing) and leverages established methods referenced implicitly or explicitly through the literature review. The methodology is well-defined, with a logical separation of concerns in the multi-agent architecture. The inclusion of specific metrics (KS divergence, correlation distance), validation types (type, range, uniqueness, referential integrity), privacy mechanisms (DP noise, DP-SGD), and evaluation protocols (TSTR, TRTS) demonstrates rigor. Technical formulations are standard and appear correctly applied. Minor gaps might exist in detailing the exact agent interaction protocols or the complexity of ensuring DP across the entire pipeline, but the overall approach is technically robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. It requires access to significant computational resources (for fine-tuning/running large LLMs like Llama-3-70B) and diverse datasets. The necessary technologies (LLMs, DP libraries, RAG frameworks) are available. However, successfully fine-tuning an LLM for complex tabular structures, coordinating the multi-agent system effectively (especially the feedback loops), ensuring rigorous schema validation for complex rules, and balancing the DP/utility trade-off present moderate technical risks. Scalability to very large datasets could also be a concern. While achievable within a dedicated research effort, it requires substantial resources and expertise, and some aspects might need refinement during implementation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of generating high-fidelity, privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data, which currently limits ML applications in many domains due to data scarcity or sensitivity. By aiming to produce realistic data that respects complex schema constraints and offers privacy guarantees, SynthTab has the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art. The expected contributions—enabling better data augmentation, facilitating safe data sharing, improving testing, and potentially creating production-ready systems—are substantial. Success would have a broad impact across various fields relying on tabular data, aligning well with the workshop's goals."
