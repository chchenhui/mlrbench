        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop on Open Science for Foundation Models), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of open science, accessibility, compute efficiency, and open training protocols for FMs. It faithfully expands on the research idea of using federated distillation with a public proxy dataset. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and cites relevant works from the literature review (e.g., Federated Foundation Models, Federated Distillation surveys, methods addressing heterogeneity/efficiency), clearly positioning the proposed work within the existing landscape and explicitly stating how it aims to tackle identified challenges like communication cost and data heterogeneity."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, problem statement, and proposed solution (FedDistill-FM) are articulated concisely and logically. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides a detailed algorithmic description, including mathematical formulations for key steps like aggregation and distillation loss. The experimental design is comprehensive and easy to follow, outlining datasets, models, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The structure is logical, making the entire proposal immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Federated Learning and Knowledge Distillation are established fields, and the use of public datasets in FL/FD has been explored (e.g., HierarchyFL), the specific application of federated distillation *using a public proxy dataset for logit exchange* explicitly aimed at the *collaborative and efficient training of open foundation models* to enhance accessibility presents a novel synthesis. It distinguishes itself from standard FL (weight sharing), standard KD (requires teacher/original data), and other FD variants by its specific mechanism and focus on democratizing FM development. The novelty lies more in the targeted application and specific framework design rather than inventing a fundamentally new technique, but it's a well-motivated and distinct approach within the context of open FM training."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations of Federated Learning and Knowledge Distillation. The proposed FedDistill-FM algorithm is technically well-described, and the use of standard techniques like KL divergence for distillation is appropriate. The rationale for addressing challenges like heterogeneity and communication cost through the proposed mechanism is logical. The experimental design is particularly strong, featuring relevant datasets, appropriate model choices (student/specialist), comprehensive baselines (including theoretical upper bounds and standard FL), clear evaluation metrics covering performance and efficiency, and planned ablation studies to investigate key parameters (e.g., public dataset impact). Technical formulations appear correct and are clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. The core technical components (model training, inference, logit aggregation, distillation) rely on standard machine learning operations and libraries (PyTorch/JAX, FL frameworks). Simulating the federated environment is a standard research practice and achievable with typical academic compute resources. The required datasets (public corpora subsets, benchmarks) are accessible. While real-world deployment poses coordination challenges, the proposed research focuses on simulation, which is entirely feasible. The reliance on finding a suitable public proxy dataset is a key factor but manageable within the scope of the research."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely challenge of extreme resource requirements for training foundation models, which currently limits access and hinders open science â€“ a core concern of the target workshop. By proposing a method to democratize FM development, enhance efficiency, and maintain privacy, the research has the potential to make substantial contributions. Successful implementation could lower barriers for academic and smaller institutions, foster greater openness and reproducibility, and advance research in distributed AI. The alignment with the open science movement in AI further boosts its significance."
