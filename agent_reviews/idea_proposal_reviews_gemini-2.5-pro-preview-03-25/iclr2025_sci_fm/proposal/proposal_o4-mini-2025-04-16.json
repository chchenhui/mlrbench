    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop on Open Science for Foundation Models), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses key workshop themes like open training protocols, open compute efficiency techniques, and democratizing FM access. The methodology follows the core research idea precisely. It acknowledges and builds upon the cited literature on federated learning, federated distillation, and challenges like communication cost and heterogeneity, positioning itself clearly within the existing research landscape."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly written. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides a good level of detail, including mathematical notation and algorithmic steps. The experimental design is comprehensive and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact handling if specialist models initially have different output structures before distillation on the common proxy dataset, but overall, the proposal is very understandable and well-articulated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While federated distillation itself is an existing concept (as shown in the literature review), the specific application to collaboratively train a compact Foundation Model from potentially heterogeneous, large-scale specialist FMs using only logit exchange over a small public proxy dataset is innovative. It offers a distinct approach compared to standard FedAvg for FMs or other FD techniques focusing on different aspects (e.g., feature distillation, prompt distillation). The emphasis on democratizing FM training through this specific mechanism adds to its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is methodologically sound and rigorous. It builds on established principles of knowledge distillation (KL divergence) and federated learning. The mathematical formulations are clearly presented and appear correct. The approach for handling model heterogeneity via logit distillation is plausible. The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines, diverse datasets/tasks, and comprehensive metrics (performance, cost, privacy, scalability). The inclusion of differential privacy considerations adds to the rigor, although detailed analysis would be part of the research itself."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It leverages standard ML frameworks (PyTorch, HuggingFace, Flower) and accessible datasets. The proposed model sizes and experimental scale (simulation + potential real-world test) are ambitious but realistic for well-equipped research settings. The core mechanism (logit exchange) is computationally less demanding than weight exchange, supporting the feasibility of the communication efficiency claims. Potential challenges like proxy dataset selection are acknowledged implicitly via future work, but the core research plan is straightforward."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the resource barrier and lack of openness in foundation model training. By proposing a communication-efficient, privacy-preserving, and collaborative framework, it has the potential to democratize access to FM development, fostering open science and reproducibility. Successful execution could lead to substantial contributions in efficient AI training, privacy-preserving ML, and enabling research in sensitive domains. The alignment with open science principles further boosts its significance."
