    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (SCI-FM workshop goals of open science, innovative training, efficiency), the research idea (Federated Distillation for open FMs using a proxy dataset), and the literature review (building upon existing work in FFMs, FD, efficiency, heterogeneity). It directly addresses the workshop's call for open training protocols and compute efficiency techniques for foundation models, explicitly linking its goals to democratizing FM development and fostering open science. The methodology directly implements the core research idea, and the problem statement reflects challenges highlighted in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (FD framework steps), and experimental design are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The use of mathematical notation for algorithmic steps aids clarity. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of the confidence function `conf()` used in aggregation or the specific mechanisms beyond Dirichlet splits to handle heterogeneity, but these do not significantly detract from the overall comprehensibility. The structure is logical and follows standard research proposal format."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While Federated Learning, Knowledge Distillation, and the use of proxy datasets are existing concepts (as shown in the literature review), the specific application and system design – using Federated Distillation with a public proxy dataset to collaboratively train a central *student* Foundation Model from distributed *specialist* models, explicitly aiming for *open* and *democratized* FM development – offers a novel approach. It's not inventing a fundamentally new algorithm but rather a novel synthesis and application tailored to address the unique challenges of open FM training. The distinction from prior work (e.g., focusing on training the FM itself via FD rather than just using FMs within FL) is reasonably clear."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in well-established techniques (FL, KD) and relevant literature. The proposed FD methodology is logical, and the steps are well-defined. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse metrics (accuracy, efficiency, robustness, privacy), appropriate datasets/models for FM research, and standard simulation tools. The mathematical formulations are generally correct, although minor details like the `conf()` function lack explicit definition, slightly reducing full rigor. Overall, the approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible, particularly within a simulation environment using tools like PyTorch Federated and Flower. Accessing public proxy datasets (C4, ImageNet) is straightforward. However, training and simulating even moderately sized FMs (like FLAN-T5 or GPT-3 architectures) across potentially 100+ clients requires significant computational resources. Simulating diverse, private datasets (especially specialized ones like medical data) might require using partitioned standard datasets as proxies. While technically complex, the implementation is achievable with current ML expertise. The main challenges relate to computational scale rather than fundamental technical barriers, making it reasonably feasible for a well-resourced research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of the high cost and centralization of foundation model development, which is a major barrier to open science and broader participation in AI research. By proposing a method to democratize FM training, it directly aligns with the SCI-FM workshop's core mission. Success would lower resource barriers, enable wider collaboration, and promote reproducibility. The potential contributions (validated framework, open-source benchmarks, models, protocols) would be highly valuable to the research community, particularly for resource-constrained institutions."
