    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the task description's focus on open science, efficiency, and foundation models for the SCI-FM workshop. It directly addresses themes like 'Open Foundation Models', 'Open Training Protocols', and 'Open Compute Efficiency Techniques'. It accurately reflects the core research idea of using federated distillation for efficient, open FM training, emphasizing collaboration, privacy, and democratization. It is also consistent with the themes and challenges (privacy, communication, scalability) identified in the literature review. A minor point preventing a higher score is that the proposal's methodology section doesn't explicitly incorporate the 'shared, public dataset proxy' detail mentioned in the research idea for the distillation aggregation step, slightly reducing the fidelity to the original idea."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally understandable with a logical structure and clearly stated objectives and significance. However, it lacks clarity in crucial methodological details. The specific knowledge distillation techniques (e.g., output-based, feature-based) and aggregation methods (beyond naming possibilities like FedAvg) are not specified. How distilled knowledge (outputs vs. gradients) is precisely used to train the student model is unclear. The approach to ensuring and evaluating data privacy is mentioned as an objective but not detailed. The experimental design lacks specifics on datasets, benchmarks, baselines, and partitioning strategies. The mentioned Figure 1 is also missing. These ambiguities require further elaboration for full comprehension and reproducibility."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal applies the established concept of Federated Distillation (FD), well-documented in the provided literature review, to the training of Foundation Models (FMs). While combining FL and KD isn't new, its specific application to democratize the training of *open* FMs and address resource constraints in this context holds relevance and some novelty. However, the proposal does not articulate a fundamentally new FD algorithm or mechanism distinct from existing work surveyed. The novelty appears primarily application-driven (FD for open FMs) rather than methodological. The potentially novel aspect mentioned in the idea (using a public dataset proxy for aggregation) is not clearly described or leveraged in the proposal's methodology, limiting the demonstrated innovation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is based on sound underlying concepts: Federated Learning and Knowledge Distillation. The motivation and high-level approach (client specialists, server student) are reasonable. However, the proposal lacks technical rigor and depth. There is no formal problem definition or mathematical formulation. Key methodological choices (specific distillation algorithm, aggregation function) are left unspecified. The mechanisms for ensuring data privacy are not detailed or analyzed. Potential critical issues identified in the literature review, such as data heterogeneity and its impact on FD, are not explicitly addressed with specific mitigation strategies within the proposed framework. The lack of technical detail significantly weakens the soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Implementing a Federated Distillation framework for smaller FMs is generally feasible using existing FL/KD libraries and techniques. Public datasets are available, and simulation environments can be set up. However, the proposal overlooks several practical challenges. Training even smaller FMs federatedly requires substantial computational resources. Achieving good performance with the distilled student model, especially under data heterogeneity (a common FL challenge not addressed here), can be difficult. The communication cost reduction depends heavily on the unspecified distillation details (e.g., size of distilled knowledge). The lack of a detailed plan for handling these aspects introduces moderate risks regarding the successful implementation and achievement of stated goals."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses highly significant and timely challenges in the AI field: the extreme resource requirements for training foundation models, the resulting centralization, the lack of transparency hindering open science, and data privacy concerns. By aiming to create a framework for collaborative, efficient, and privacy-preserving training of open FMs, the research has the potential for substantial impact. It could democratize access to FM development, foster reproducibility and open science (aligning perfectly with the workshop theme), and lead to more resource-friendly models. The potential contributions are substantial and clearly articulated."
