        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of learning robust models against spurious correlations without group annotations, a key challenge highlighted. The methodology meticulously expands on the research idea (ACA framework: identification -> generation -> robust training). It positions itself clearly within the recent literature provided, acknowledging similar goals but proposing a distinct approach (attribution-guided counterfactual generation) compared to methods like subnetwork extraction or ERM loss weighting. The objectives and planned experiments directly target the solicited topics like discovery, learning robust models, and evaluation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from motivation to methodology, experiments, and impact. Key concepts like ACA and its components are explained, and the overall workflow is understandable. Mathematical formulations for influence functions, integrated gradients, diffusion models, and loss functions are provided. The experimental design is detailed. Minor ambiguities exist in the specifics of feature clustering/ranking, the precise conditioning mechanism for the diffusion model mask 'm', and the exact interplay/necessity of the consistency vs. adversarial losses, but these do not significantly hinder overall comprehension. The proposal is generally well-defined and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components (influence functions, gradient attribution, diffusion models, consistency loss, adversarial training) exist, their specific integration within the ACA framework is innovative. The core novelty lies in using a combination of attribution techniques (influence + gradients) to explicitly identify potential spurious features and then using these identifications to guide a conditional generative model (diffusion model) to create targeted counterfactuals for robustness training, specifically *without* requiring group labels. This approach differs significantly from existing methods mentioned in the literature review that rely on group labels, multiple environments, subnetwork extraction, or re-weighting based on ERM loss."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (influence functions, attribution methods, generative modeling, consistency regularization). The proposed methodology is technically plausible, outlining a step-by-step approach. The use of state-of-the-art techniques like integrated gradients and diffusion models is appropriate. The mathematical formulations are generally correct, although the feature modification loss (L2 norm) might be simplistic and require refinement. Key assumptions (accurate identification of spurious features, effective counterfactual generation preserving semantics, consistency loss enforcing invariance) are reasonable research hypotheses to investigate. The inclusion of ablation studies strengthens the rigor by planning to test the contribution of each component."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating influence functions (computationally expensive), gradient attribution, conditional diffusion models (complex to train and tune), and adversarial training requires substantial technical expertise and significant computational resources (GPU time). The process of identifying, masking, generating, and retraining involves multiple complex stages that need careful engineering and hyperparameter tuning. While the datasets proposed are standard (except potentially medical data requiring specific access/validation), the overall complexity makes successful implementation demanding and carries considerable risk regarding the quality of identification/generation and training stability. The medical expert validation adds another potential bottleneck."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and pervasive problem of spurious correlations, which severely limits the reliability and fairness of ML models in real-world, high-stakes applications (as emphasized by the workshop call). Developing a method that improves robustness *without* requiring expensive group annotations would be a major advancement, making robust ML more practical and accessible. Success would lead to more reliable models in areas like healthcare and NLP, potentially improving fairness and trustworthiness. The interpretability aspect (visualizing identified features) adds further value. The research directly aligns with the goal of producing foundational research with real-world impact."
