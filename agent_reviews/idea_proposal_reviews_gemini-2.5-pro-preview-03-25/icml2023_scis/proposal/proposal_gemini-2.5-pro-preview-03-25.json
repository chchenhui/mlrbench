        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of spurious correlations and the need for robust models without group annotations, as highlighted in the workshop call. The methodology clearly operationalizes the research idea (ACA framework using attribution, generation, consistency loss). It effectively situates itself within the recent literature provided, acknowledging prior work (group-based, group-free, counterfactual methods) and addressing key challenges identified (feature identification, counterfactual generation quality). The proposed experiments and baselines reflect an understanding of the current SOTA and evaluation practices in the field. It comprehensively covers the solicited topics like learning robust models, diagnosing correlations (via attribution), and touching upon causal concepts (counterfactuals)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and evaluation plan. Key concepts like ACA, spurious features, counterfactual generation, and consistency loss are explained well. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology breaks down the approach into distinct, understandable stages with concrete techniques suggested for each. The experimental design is thorough, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Minor points like the precise nature of 'adversarial' could be slightly elaborated, but overall, the proposal is exceptionally clear and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it builds upon existing concepts (attribution methods, generative models, consistency regularization, counterfactual reasoning), its core contribution – the specific pipeline of using model internals (attribution/influence) to automatically guide a conditional generative model to create targeted counterfactuals for mitigating *unknown* spurious correlations without group labels – is novel. This approach differs significantly from standard data augmentation, re-weighting methods (like LfF, EVaLS), pseudo-group inference (like GEORGE, GIC), or subnetwork extraction (Le et al.). It offers a fresh perspective on group-free robustness by actively generating challenging examples based on the model's own potential weaknesses."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of spurious correlations, OOD generalization, attribution methods, and generative modeling. The rationale for using attribution to find potentially spurious features and consistency loss to enforce invariance is logical. The proposed methodology (three stages) is well-structured. Using state-of-the-art techniques like diffusion models for generation is appropriate. Key assumptions (attribution identifies spuriousness, generator modifies correctly, consistency enforces robustness) are inherent to the approach and represent the core research challenges, but the overall framework is technically plausible. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant baselines and metrics. Minor weaknesses include the inherent uncertainty in attribution methods perfectly isolating spurious features and the technical difficulty of perfectly controlled generation, but the proposal acknowledges the need for careful implementation (e.g., label preservation)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Accessing benchmark datasets and standard model architectures is straightforward. However, training high-quality conditional generative models (especially diffusion models) capable of targeted modification based on attribution masks while preserving labels and semantics is complex and computationally intensive. Tuning the interplay between the three stages (identification, generation, retraining) and balancing the loss terms (\\lambda) will require careful experimentation. While the plan uses standard tools (PyTorch), successful implementation demands significant expertise in both generative modeling and robustness evaluation. The risks associated with the quality of generated counterfactuals and the effectiveness of attribution methods are non-trivial, making the project ambitious but achievable for a well-resourced team."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: the lack of robustness due to spurious correlations, particularly in the common scenario where group labels are unavailable. Developing effective group-free methods is critical for deploying reliable AI in real-world applications (healthcare, autonomous systems, fairness). If successful, the ACA framework could provide a powerful and practical tool for practitioners, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in robust ML. It aligns perfectly with the workshop themes and has the potential for broad impact across various domains. The contribution to bridging causality (counterfactuals) and deep learning for robustness is also noteworthy."
