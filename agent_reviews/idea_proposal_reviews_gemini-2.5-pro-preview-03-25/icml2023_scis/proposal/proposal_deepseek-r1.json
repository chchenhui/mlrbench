        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of spurious correlations and the need for robust models, a central theme of the workshop. The proposed method (ACA) specifically targets learning robust models without group annotations, aligning with both the research idea and a key challenge highlighted in the literature review and workshop call (e.g., comparing to EVaLS, Le et al.). It incorporates elements of discovery (feature identification), learning robust models (invariance training), and evaluation, fitting well within the solicited topics. The methodology directly implements the steps outlined in the research idea and positions itself relevantly against the cited recent works."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure with well-defined sections for background, objectives, methodology, outcomes, and challenges. The objectives are specific, and the methodology outlines a step-by-step process including data, identification, generation, training, and validation. Key concepts like influence functions and consistency loss are mentioned, and formulas are provided. Baselines and evaluation metrics are clearly listed. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for combining influence functions and saliency maps to generate the mask 'm' for the generator, and the exact interpretation of 'adversarial' in ACA (seems related to counterfactuals/generator loss, not classifier training). However, these do not significantly impede overall understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components (influence functions, generative models, consistency loss) are known, their combination into the ACA framework for annotation-free spurious correlation robustness appears novel. Specifically, the pipeline involving automated identification of potentially spurious features (using influence/attribution) directly guiding a conditional generative model to create targeted counterfactuals for consistency training is a fresh approach. This distinguishes it from methods requiring group labels (Group DRO), those using different annotation-free techniques like loss weighting (EVaLS) or subnetwork extraction (Le et al.), meta-learning (SPUME), or purely causal graph-based methods. The novelty lies in the specific integration and application of these techniques to tackle spurious correlations without group labels."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established ML techniques. Influence functions, gradient attribution, conditional diffusion models, and consistency regularization are all well-founded concepts. The proposed evaluation plan is comprehensive. However, there are areas needing further justification or detail. The crucial step of translating identification signals (influence scores, saliency maps) into a precise mask or condition ('m') for the generative model lacks specific operational detail ('Features with high influence but low causal relevance' needs clearer definition and implementation). The assumption that these methods can reliably isolate *only* spurious features is strong. Furthermore, ensuring the generator *only* modifies these features while perfectly preserving causal ones is inherently challenging, though acknowledged. Technical formulations presented are correct, but the link between identification and generation needs more rigorous specification."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. Using standard benchmark datasets is straightforward. However, calculating influence functions (especially with Hessian inverses) can be computationally demanding for large models. Training state-of-the-art conditional generative models like diffusion models requires significant computational resources (GPUs, time) and expertise. Generating counterfactuals for a large portion of the training data adds overhead. While the proposal mentions mitigations like latent diffusion, the overall computational cost remains a significant factor. The complexity of tuning the generative model to produce high-quality, targeted counterfactuals is also a non-trivial implementation hurdle. Overall, it's feasible within a well-resourced research setting but requires careful implementation and potentially approximations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and pervasive problem in machine learning – the lack of robustness due to spurious correlations. Failures caused by such correlations undermine trust and hinder deployment, especially in critical areas like healthcare (explicitly mentioned). The key contribution – achieving robustness *without* requiring group annotations – addresses a major practical bottleneck, potentially making robust training methods far more accessible. Success would represent a substantial advancement over annotation-free baselines and contribute valuable insights into the interplay between identification, generation, and invariance. The potential impact spans practical applications (more reliable AI), theoretical understanding, and societal benefits (fairer models)."
