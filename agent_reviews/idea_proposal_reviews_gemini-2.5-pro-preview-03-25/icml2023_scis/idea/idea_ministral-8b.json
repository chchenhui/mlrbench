    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme of spurious correlations, invariance, and stability. It directly addresses the core problem outlined in the task description: models relying on spurious features and failing in real-world scenarios. The proposed method aims at 'Learning robust models in the presence of spurious correlations' and touches upon 'Exploring relationships b/n methods from causal ML, algorithmic fairness, and OOD generalization', both explicitly solicited topics. The motivation and expected outcomes align perfectly with the workshop's goals of finding solutions to spurious correlations and developing more reliable ML models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main components (feature selection, adversarial training, invariance constraints), and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The overall goal of using adversarial methods to enforce invariance against spurious features is understandable. However, the exact mechanism of how 'adversarial invariance constraints' are formulated and implemented, and how they specifically leverage principles from causal inference and fairness beyond the general concept of invariance, could be slightly more detailed for perfect clarity. The distinction and interplay between step 2 (adversarial training) and step 3 (invariance constraints) could also be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing concepts: adversarial training (often used for robustness against input perturbations) and invariance constraints (used in causality, fairness, and OOD generalization, e.g., IRM). Applying adversarial techniques specifically to enforce invariance against identified spurious features is a reasonable direction but may not be entirely groundbreaking. It represents a potentially valuable synthesis and application of known techniques rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and application focus rather than the individual components."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research appears largely feasible. Techniques for feature importance, adversarial training, and implementing constraints in deep learning models are relatively well-established. Combining these elements is technically achievable with standard ML frameworks and compute resources. Potential challenges include accurately identifying spurious features to target (step 1), defining the appropriate invariance transformations (step 3), and designing effective adversarial attacks against these specific features (step 2), but these seem like addressable research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant and timely problem in machine learning â€“ the lack of robustness due to spurious correlations, as emphasized by the workshop call. Developing effective methods to mitigate reliance on spurious features and improve model generalization would be a major contribution with substantial impact across various domains (like healthcare, NLP, etc., mentioned in the task description). Success in this research could lead to more trustworthy, reliable, and equitable AI systems, aligning perfectly with the workshop's interest in foundational research with real-world impact."
