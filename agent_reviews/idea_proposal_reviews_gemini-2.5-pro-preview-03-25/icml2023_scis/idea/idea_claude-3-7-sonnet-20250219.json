        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses two explicitly solicited topics: 'Methods for discovering and diagnosing spurious correlations' and 'Evaluation and stress tests of model stability'. The motivation highlights the exact problem the workshop focuses on â€“ models exploiting spurious correlations and failing in the wild. Furthermore, it explicitly mentions combining methods from Causal ML and stress testing, which aligns with the workshop's interest in exploring relationships between different approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly. The motivation outlines the problem and the gap in existing methods concisely. The main idea is well-defined, proposing a specific framework combining causal graphs and adversarial perturbations. The three core components are listed, giving a good overview of the proposed process. The intended benefits (interpretability, systematic detection) are also clearly stated. While implementation details are not fully specified (as expected for an idea summary), the overall concept is crystal clear and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by proposing a specific synergy between causal inference and adversarial machine learning for stress testing. While causality and adversarial methods are established fields, using a causal graph derived from domain knowledge to *guide* the generation of adversarial perturbations specifically along *non-causal* paths to systematically *detect* spurious correlations appears innovative. It moves beyond generic stress testing or purely data-driven detection methods by incorporating explicit causal reasoning into the vulnerability discovery process."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. The primary hurdles include: 1) Constructing an accurate and sufficiently complete causal graph, which relies heavily on domain expertise and may be difficult for complex systems. 2) Automatically identifying 'potential spurious pathways' from the graph might require specific algorithms or heuristics. 3) Generating targeted adversarial perturbations constrained to specific non-causal pathways is technically non-trivial compared to standard input perturbations. Despite these challenges, the components build on existing techniques in causality and adversarial ML, suggesting it is achievable with careful research and development, likely requiring moderate effort and refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: the lack of reliability due to spurious correlations, especially in high-stakes applications mentioned in the motivation (healthcare, justice). Providing a systematic, causality-guided method for proactively detecting these vulnerabilities before deployment would be a major advancement. The potential impact is high, leading to more robust and trustworthy models. The interpretability aspect, linking detected weaknesses to specific causal assumptions, further enhances its significance by enabling targeted model improvements."
