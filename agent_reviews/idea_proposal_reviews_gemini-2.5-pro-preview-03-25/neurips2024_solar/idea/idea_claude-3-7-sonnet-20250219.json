        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The SoLaR workshop explicitly lists 'Transparency, explainability, interpretability of LMs' as a key topic. The proposed 'Transparency Ledger' directly addresses the need for transparency and accountability in LLM development and deployment, which are central themes of the workshop focused on socially responsible LM research and addressing risks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation outlines the problem (transparency gap) effectively. The main idea clearly describes the proposed solution (a distributed ledger for the LLM lifecycle), what it aims to record, the technology involved (cryptographic verification, access controls), and its intended benefits (auditing, user understanding). It is articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity, making it immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like AI transparency (e.g., model cards) and the use of distributed ledgers for provenance exist independently, applying a comprehensive, cryptographically secured ledger framework specifically to track the *entire lifecycle* of an LLM (data, training, fine-tuning, deployment) for transparency and auditability is a relatively novel approach within the ML field. It offers a fresh perspective on achieving verifiable transparency for complex models like LLMs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating comprehensive logging across diverse MLOps pipelines, ensuring scalability for massive datasets and computations, balancing transparency with proprietary information protection through effective access controls, achieving standardization on what to log, and managing the computational overhead of the ledger are all considerable hurdles. It requires substantial engineering effort, resources, and potentially industry-wide collaboration, making implementation non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It directly tackles the critical problem of opacity in LLM development and deployment, which undermines trust, accountability, and responsible AI practices. If successfully implemented, a transparency ledger could substantially improve auditability, help verify claims about model behavior and provenance, and foster greater public trust in AI systems, representing a major advancement in responsible AI infrastructure."
