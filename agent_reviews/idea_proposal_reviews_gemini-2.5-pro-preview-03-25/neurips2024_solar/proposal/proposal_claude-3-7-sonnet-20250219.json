    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (SoLaR workshop themes like transparency, low-resource languages, bias, community impact), the research idea (elaborating on adapting methods, co-design, and evaluation), and the literature review (building upon cited works like InkubaLM, Glot500, and specific papers on interpretability, community engagement, and challenges in low-resource settings). It directly addresses the workshop's call for socially responsible LM research, focusing on equity and transparency for marginalized linguistic communities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly outlines the problem and motivation. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology is detailed, broken down into logical components (technical adaptation, community design, evaluation) with specific steps, techniques, and even illustrative technical formulations. The experimental protocol and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using existing methods like SHAP/LIME and participatory design, its novelty lies in the specific technical adaptations proposed for low-resource language features (morpheme-level and hierarchical attribution, cross-lingual normalization for code-switching, cultural relevance scoring) and the deep integration of these technical aspects with culturally-grounded, community-co-designed interfaces and evaluation metrics (Cultural Alignment Score). This synthesis, specifically targeting interpretability for low-resource languages with a strong emphasis on cultural context and community agency, represents a fresh and innovative approach compared to existing work cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established interpretability techniques (SHAP, LIME) and participatory design principles, referencing relevant literature. The methodology is comprehensive, outlining specific technical adaptations, community engagement protocols, and a multi-faceted evaluation framework (technical, user-centric, community impact). The inclusion of technical formulations (though requiring empirical validation) indicates rigor. The evaluation plan covering faithfulness, consistency, user trust, and community impact is robust. Minor gaps exist in detailing how certain parameters (e.g., weights in formulas) would be learned or optimized, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. The technical aspects (adapting SHAP/LIME, building interfaces) are achievable. However, the plan involves deep community engagement (recruitment, 3-5 workshops per community, iterative design) across four diverse low-resource languages within an 18-month timeline, which is highly ambitious and logistically complex. Securing strong community partnerships, recruiting diverse participants, and developing language-specific resources (morphological tools, cultural KBs) might require significant effort and time, potentially exceeding the proposed schedule. There are moderate risks related to community engagement success and resource availability."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical gap in AI ethics and NLP: the lack of transparency and potential for harm of LMs in low-resource language contexts, affecting marginalized communities. By aiming to create culturally-grounded, interpretable models and empowering communities with auditing tools, the research has the potential for major advancements in equitable AI development. The expected outcomes (adapted algorithms, open-source toolkit, benchmarks, community empowerment) could have substantial positive social and research impacts, strongly aligning with the goals of socially responsible AI."
