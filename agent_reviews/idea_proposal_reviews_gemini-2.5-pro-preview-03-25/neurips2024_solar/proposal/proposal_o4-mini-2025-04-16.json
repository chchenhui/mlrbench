        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (SoLaR workshop themes like transparency, interpretability, bias, equity, low-resource languages), the research idea (focus on interpretable LMs for low-resource languages via adapted methods and community co-design), and the literature review (addressing identified challenges like data scarcity, linguistic diversity, code-switching, and building upon recent work in low-resource LMs and interpretability). It comprehensively integrates all requirements and context, showing a deep understanding of the problem space and prior work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology is logically structured into distinct phases with detailed steps (data collection, model training, interpretability adaptation, evaluation). Technical aspects like model architecture and interpretability adaptations (SHAP, LIME) are described, including formulas. The community co-design process is outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for SHAP approximation via morph feature clustering, but overall the proposal is well-articulated and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing interpretability techniques (SHAP, LIME) and LM architectures, its novelty lies in the specific adaptations proposed for handling morphological complexity and code-switching in low-resource settings (e.g., hierarchical kernel for SHAP, morphological distance for LIME). Furthermore, the integration of these technical adaptations with a structured community co-design process for explanation interfaces tailored to low-resource languages represents a fresh and valuable approach. It's not entirely groundbreaking but offers a significant synthesis and advancement over existing work highlighted in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established LM techniques (Transformers, MLM) and interpretability methods (SHAP, LIME). The rationale for adapting these methods to low-resource languages is strong. The methodology includes appropriate steps for data collection (using tools like GlotLID-M), model training, and adaptation. The proposed technical adaptations for SHAP and LIME are plausible, and the plan includes validation steps. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, combining technical metrics (fidelity, stability) with human-centric ones (trust, usability, cultural alignment). A minor weakness might be the relatively small size of the annotated dataset (5k sentences/language), which could limit the robustness of some findings, but the overall approach is methodologically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing technologies and methods, focusing on adaptation rather than invention from scratch. Training a 50M parameter model, adapting SHAP/LIME, and performing the planned evaluations are achievable with standard ML infrastructure and expertise. The data collection relies on existing corpora and planned annotation. The community co-design aspect, while requiring careful planning and resources for workshops and participant engagement, is a recognized methodology. Potential risks (data quality, annotation consistency, community engagement logistics, effectiveness of adaptations) exist but seem manageable within a well-resourced project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical intersection of LM interpretability, low-resource languages, and social responsibility (fairness, equity, bias). Enhancing transparency for LMs used by or about marginalized linguistic communities has major implications for reducing digital inequity and potential harms. The expected outcomes—open-source tools (MorphExplain), annotated datasets, design guidelines, and community empowerment—have substantial potential to benefit both the research community and the specific language communities involved. It directly aligns with the goals of the SoLaR workshop and addresses a pressing need in the field."
