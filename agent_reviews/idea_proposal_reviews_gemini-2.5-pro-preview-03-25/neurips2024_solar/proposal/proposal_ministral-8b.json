        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (SoLaR workshop themes like transparency, equity, bias, interpretability, LMs for low-resource languages), the research idea (interpretable LMs for low-resource languages via adapted methods and community collaboration), and the literature review (building on existing work like Glot500, InkubaLM, GlotLID, and specific papers on XAI for low-resource languages, community-centric design, and trust evaluation). It directly addresses the core concepts and goals outlined in all source materials, ensuring strong coherence."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly written. The objectives are specific and enumerated. The methodology outlines the key steps, data sources, and evaluation metrics logically. The significance and expected outcomes are well-articulated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise technical details of how SHAP/LIME adaptations will handle specific linguistic features (morphology, code-switching), but the overall research plan is understandable and clearly presented."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by synthesizing existing concepts in a new way. While adapting XAI methods (SHAP/LIME) and involving communities are not entirely new ideas in isolation, the proposal's novelty lies in the integrated framework specifically tailored for low-resource languages. This includes adapting methods for *both* morphology and code-switching, the strong emphasis on *co-designing* explanation interfaces based on *cultural communication norms*, and the combined technical/user-trust evaluation strategy within this specific context. It builds clearly on the cited literature but proposes a distinct, combined approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is based on sound theoretical foundations (LMs, XAI, low-resource challenges) and established methods (SHAP, LIME, community-based research). The methodology is generally rigorous, proposing adaptations of known techniques and a comprehensive evaluation plan (technical robustness and user trust). However, the technical soundness is slightly weakened by the lack of specific details on *how* the SHAP/LIME adaptations will be implemented to handle complex linguistic features effectively. While referencing GlotLID for code-switching adds some grounding, more detail on the adaptation mechanisms themselves would strengthen this aspect."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using existing datasets (Glot500, InkubaLM) and baseline methods (SHAP, LIME). However, significant challenges exist. Adapting XAI methods for diverse and complex low-resource linguistic features (morphology, code-switching) could be technically demanding. Furthermore, effective community collaboration (co-design, evaluation) requires substantial logistical effort, time, cultural sensitivity, and potentially resources for participant compensation, which can be complex to manage successfully. The overall scope is ambitious, requiring careful planning and resource allocation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem at the intersection of AI ethics, NLP, and social equity. Enhancing transparency and trustworthiness of LMs for low-resource languages is critical for reducing bias, promoting equitable technology access, and empowering marginalized communities. The potential impact is substantial, contributing to responsible AI practices, advancing NLP for under-represented languages, and potentially leading to widely adopted open-source tools and guidelines. It aligns perfectly with the goals of the SoLaR workshop."
