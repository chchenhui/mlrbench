        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Data Problems x Foundation Models', 'Data Quality, Dataset Curation', 'Data Perspective to Alignment', and 'Data Perspective on Safety and Ethics'. The proposed idea directly addresses data curation for safety and alignment in Foundation Models using a novel RL-based approach, fitting squarely within the workshop's core interests."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core mechanism (RL-guided selection based on safety/alignment rewards), and expected outcomes are clearly presented in a step-by-step manner. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the 'lightweight foundation model' used for evaluation, the nature and scale of 'human-labeled probes' for alignment signals, and the precise dynamics of the closed-loop refinement process. However, the central concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While RL and data curation are established fields, applying RL specifically to dynamically guide data selection for safety alignment *during* the data preparation phase for FMs is innovative. It contrasts with static filtering or post-hoc alignment methods like RLHF. The novelty lies in the proposed closed-loop system where an RL agent learns a data selection policy based on safety/alignment feedback, offering a fresh perspective on data-centric AI for responsible FM development."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. Core components like RL algorithms (PPO), safety classifiers, and foundation models are available. Key challenges include: 1) Designing a robust and non-gameable composite reward function. 2) Managing the computational cost of training the RL agent and periodically fine-tuning/evaluating the FM. 3) Scaling the RL selection process to massive datasets. 4) Ensuring the proxy alignment signals are effective without excessive human effort. While requiring careful engineering and potentially significant compute, it doesn't rely on fundamentally unavailable technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Ensuring the safety and alignment of foundation models is a critical challenge in AI development. Current manual curation methods scale poorly. An automated, data-centric approach like the one proposed, if successful, could lead to major advancements in building safer, more reliable FMs at scale. It addresses a key bottleneck and has the potential for substantial positive impact on the field and deployment of AI."
