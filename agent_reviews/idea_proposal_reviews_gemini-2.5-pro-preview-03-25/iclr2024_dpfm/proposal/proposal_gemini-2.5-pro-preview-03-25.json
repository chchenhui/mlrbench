    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data problems for foundation models, specifically data curation, quality, safety, and alignment from a data perspective. The proposal meticulously expands on the core research idea, detailing the RL-driven curation framework. Furthermore, it explicitly references and differentiates itself from the works mentioned in the literature review (Maini et al., Shi et al., Dong et al.) and directly tackles the key challenges identified (Data Quality, Scalability, Alignment, Evaluation, Safety-Performance Balance). There are no discernible inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It features a logical structure, a precise problem statement, and clearly articulated research objectives. The methodology section is detailed, including a helpful conceptual diagram (Mermaid chart), specific descriptions of data handling, reward function components, RL agent design (state, action, algorithm), FM integration, and a comprehensive experimental plan. The language is academic and precise. Minor ambiguities inherent to early-stage proposals (e.g., exact hyperparameter settings) do not detract from the overall excellent clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. The core idea of using Reinforcement Learning to *dynamically* select *input* data samples from a large corpus *during* the fine-tuning process for safety and alignment is a novel approach in the context of FM data curation. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work like static filtering (Safety Pretraining), output ranking (RAFT), data generation (Safer-Instruct), and post-hoc alignment (RLHF). The adaptive, closed-loop nature of the proposed system represents a significant conceptual advance."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in FMs, data-centric AI, and RL (PPO). The methodology is well-reasoned, leveraging existing tools and datasets for reward signals while proposing a standard RL framework. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The inclusion of a feedback loop for reward model refinement adds to the rigor. The main potential weakness, acknowledged by the authors, is the reliance on automated classifiers for reward signals, which might be imperfect or biased, and the inherent difficulty in defining robust alignment proxies (R_{align}) from unlabeled data. However, the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical and resource challenges. Implementing and training the closed-loop RL system integrated with FM fine-tuning requires substantial computational resources and expertise in both RL and large model training. Debugging and stabilizing such a system can be complex. Defining and tuning the composite reward function effectively, especially the alignment component, will require careful experimentation. The plan to start with moderately sized models (1B-7B) and data subsets makes the initial stages more manageable and demonstrates awareness of feasibility constraints. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable for a well-equipped research group."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of ensuring safety and alignment in foundation models, a major hurdle for their responsible deployment. By proposing a scalable, automated, and adaptive data curation method, it has the potential to significantly advance data-centric AI practices for safety. If successful, DynACurE could provide a valuable tool for developers and researchers, leading to more trustworthy FMs. The research directly contributes to the workshop's themes and tackles key challenges in the field, potentially opening new research avenues."
