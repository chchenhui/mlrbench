        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description's focus on data problems (curation, quality, safety, alignment) for Foundation Models. It directly implements the core research idea of using RL for dynamic data curation. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and positions itself against the provided literature review, citing relevant works (Maini et al., Shi et al., Dong et al.) and explicitly aiming to address the key challenges identified (scalability, alignment, safety-performance balance). The objectives and methodology are tightly coupled with the requirements and context provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure, defines key concepts like the MDP formulation and RL components, and details the methodology and experimental plan. The objectives are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature and calculation of the alignment signal A(x, y) using the 'lightweight probe' and its interaction with the model output y (the expectation notation seems slightly off, likely meaning expectation over model outputs given input x). However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed research."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While RL for alignment (RLHF) and data filtering/ranking (RAFT, Safety Pretraining) exist, the core idea of using RL for *dynamic, closed-loop data curation during the pretraining phase* to optimize a composite safety/alignment reward is innovative. It shifts the focus from post-hoc alignment or static filtering to an adaptive, upstream data selection process integrated with training. This distinguishes it clearly from the cited literature which focuses on static pretraining data, preference data generation for fine-tuning, or reward-ranked fine-tuning."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established methods (RL, PPO, FM pretraining). The MDP formulation is appropriate for the problem. However, there are minor weaknesses. The definition of the alignment reward component A(x, y) and the associated expectation \\\\mathbb{E}_{y \\\\sim \\\\pi_{\\\\theta}}[A(x, y)] needs clarification; the policy \\\\pi_{\\\\theta} selects data, it doesn't generate text y. It likely should involve the FM \\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\phi}. The reliability of a 'lightweight probe' as an accurate proxy for alignment, especially early in training, needs strong justification and validation. The stability and convergence properties of the proposed closed-loop system (RL influencing FM data, FM influencing RL rewards) are complex and not fully addressed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Accessing data and standard tools (Perspective API, PPO libraries) is feasible. However, the computational cost is very high (large dataset, FM pretraining, distributed RL, iterative retraining/evaluation loop). Integrating these components into a stable, efficient system is technically complex. Ensuring the RL agent learns meaningful policies without collapsing or exploiting reward proxies requires careful engineering and tuning. The reliance on 8 A100s and 128 accelerators highlights the resource intensity, making it challenging but achievable for well-resourced labs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: ensuring the safety and alignment of Foundation Models, a critical challenge in contemporary AI. By tackling this via scalable, automated data curation during pretraining, it targets the root cause rather than just downstream fixes. Success would represent a major advancement in data-centric AI for safety, potentially influencing industry best practices and enabling the development of more reliable FMs. The potential impact on automated governance and data economics further underscores its significance."
