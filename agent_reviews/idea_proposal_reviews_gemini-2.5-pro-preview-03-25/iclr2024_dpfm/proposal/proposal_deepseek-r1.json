    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on data problems for FMs, specifically data curation for safety and alignment using a data-centric approach. The methodology clearly implements the core research idea of using RL for guided data selection. It effectively incorporates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself relative to existing methods like Safety Pretraining and RAFT, and aims to tackle the key challenges identified (scalability, alignment, balancing safety/utility)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The four-stage methodology is easy to follow, and the components (reward function, RL algorithm, evaluation plan) are specified clearly. The use of mathematical notation for the reward function and RL objective adds precision. While minor implementation details (e.g., state representation for RL, exact nature of alignment probing) could be further elaborated in a full paper, the proposal is exceptionally clear for its purpose."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by framing the data curation task as a reinforcement learning problem where an agent learns an optimal *policy* for sample selection. While components like reward modeling (similar to RAFT) and safety filtering (similar to Safety Pretraining) exist, the use of RL (specifically PPO) to dynamically learn and adapt this selection policy based on a composite reward (safety, alignment, utility) represents a novel integration and approach compared to static filtering or one-off reward-based ranking. The iterative refinement loop further adds to the dynamic nature of the proposed system."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, based on established RL algorithms (PPO) and standard practices in FM evaluation. The composite reward function is a reasonable approach for multi-objective optimization. However, there are areas needing further justification or detail: 1) The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed `AlignmentScore` (proxy based on similarity metrics on a small dataset) need validation. 2) The `UtilityScore` (perplexity) might be a limited proxy for actual task performance, although downstream tasks are included in the evaluation. 3) Scalability concerns regarding the RL agent training over potentially vast datasets (\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{candidate}}) and the state representation are not fully addressed. 4) Tuning the reward weights (\\lambda_i) can be complex. Despite these points, the overall methodology is logical and technically grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using existing technologies, datasets, and models (LLaMA-7B, PPO implementations, safety classifiers). However, it presents significant engineering and computational challenges. Training an RL agent over a massive data pool, repeatedly fine-tuning FMs, and evaluating them requires substantial compute resources. Designing and tuning the composite reward function, especially balancing the \\lambda weights, will likely require considerable experimentation. The iterative refinement loop adds complexity. While achievable in a well-resourced research environment, it's not straightforward and carries moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: ensuring the safety and alignment of foundation models, which is critical for their responsible deployment. Current data curation methods struggle with scalability and adaptability. An effective RL-guided framework would represent a major advancement in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, dynamic, and potentially more nuanced approach to safety alignment than static filtering or manual annotation. Success would have substantial technical, societal (reducing harmful AI outputs), and economic (lowering curation costs) impact."
