    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Data Problems for Foundation Models', specifically focusing on data curation for safety and alignment, which are key areas mentioned in the task description. The methodology precisely follows the steps outlined in the research idea. Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as scalability of data curation, alignment with human values, and balancing safety with performance, positioning itself well within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the overall structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes) is logical. The core components of the RL framework (candidate pool, reward model, RL agent, fine-tuning loop) are described. However, some details could be slightly more elaborated, such as the precise mechanism for refining the reward model based on fine-tuning evaluations and the specific nature and generation process of the 'small human-labeled probes' for proxy alignment signals. Despite these minor points, the proposal is generally easy to understand."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using reward models and data filtering/selection for alignment exists (e.g., RAFT, Safety Pretraining), the core idea of training an RL agent to learn a *dynamic policy* for selecting and weighting data samples within a closed-loop system (including periodic model fine-tuning and potential reward model refinement) appears innovative. It differs from static pre-filtering or one-off ranking for fine-tuning by introducing an adaptive learning component for the data curation process itself. The novelty is clearly distinguished from the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established concepts (RL, PPO, reward models for alignment, data-centric AI). Using off-the-shelf safety detectors and standard RL algorithms is appropriate. The composite reward function is a reasonable starting point. However, the soundness could be improved by providing more detail on the reward model refinement process and justifying the reliability and scalability of using 'small human-labeled probes' as proxy alignment signals. The potential for the RL agent to exploit the reward function or converge to suboptimal data selection policies is a risk inherent in RL approaches that needs careful consideration during implementation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training RL agents and periodically fine-tuning even lightweight foundation models requires substantial computational resources. Integrating the RL training loop with the model fine-tuning and evaluation cycle introduces considerable engineering complexity. Ensuring the stability and effective learning of the RL agent in this complex environment is non-trivial. While the components exist (RL libraries, FM models, APIs), orchestrating them effectively and scaling the process, especially the candidate pool sampling and periodic fine-tuning, poses practical hurdles. Access to APIs and human labeling also adds constraints."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem in AI: ensuring the safety and alignment of foundation models through scalable data curation. Improving FM reliability and reducing harmful outputs without manual labor or sacrificing performance would be a major advancement. Success would directly contribute to the development of more trustworthy AI systems and provide a valuable tool for the research community, aligning perfectly with the goals of data-centric AI safety."
