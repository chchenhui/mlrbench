    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on 'Data Problems x Foundation Models', specifically 'Data Quality, Dataset Curation', and 'Data Perspective on Safety and Ethics'. It precisely implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea (RL-guided curation, composite reward, PPO, closed-loop). Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, referencing key papers on data-centric safety (Maini et al., Shi et al., Dong et al.) and explicitly tackling the challenges identified (scalability, balancing safety/performance, alignment)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (including MDP formulation, reward, PPO algorithm), experimental design, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The use of equations and a step-by-step description of the closed-loop process enhances clarity. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise features used for the policy network and the exact nature of the state representation in the MDP, but these do not significantly hinder comprehension."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While RL for alignment (RLHF) and data filtering/ranking (RAFT, Safety Pretraining) exist, the core idea of using an online RL agent to dynamically learn a *data selection policy* for curating raw training data *before* fine-tuning, specifically optimizing for safety/alignment proxies in a closed loop, is innovative. It differs significantly from RLHF (acting on model outputs) and static filtering methods by introducing an adaptive, learned data selection mechanism integrated with model training feedback. The novelty is well-articulated against the backdrop of related work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on established foundations (data-centric AI, FM safety challenges) and employs standard, robust methods (MDP formulation, PPO algorithm). The methodology, including the composite reward function and the closed-loop iteration, is technically well-defined. The technical formulations (equations) are correct. Potential weaknesses include the heavy reliance on the quality and potential biases of the off-the-shelf toxicity detectors and the proxy alignment classifiers trained on a relatively small probe set (5K samples), and potential stability challenges in the closed-loop system. However, the overall approach is methodologically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant computational demands. It requires substantial GPU resources (16xA100s) and expertise in both RL and FM training. The core challenge lies in the closed-loop nature, specifically the need to fine-tune an FM (even with adapters) within the RL loop, which could be time-consuming and limit scalability compared to offline methods. Data requirements (large corpus access, 5K labeled probes) are standard for this type of research. While complex, the plan is generally realistic with adequate resources and skilled personnel, placing it in the 'Good' feasibility range."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It tackles the critical and challenging problem of ensuring the safety and alignment of foundation models, focusing on the scalable curation of training data â€“ a major bottleneck. If successful, the proposed automated, RL-guided framework could dramatically reduce manual effort, provide a principled way to balance safety and utility, and offer an adaptable solution for evolving safety needs. It has the potential to make substantial contributions to data-centric AI and the development of safer AI systems, representing a potentially impactful advancement."
