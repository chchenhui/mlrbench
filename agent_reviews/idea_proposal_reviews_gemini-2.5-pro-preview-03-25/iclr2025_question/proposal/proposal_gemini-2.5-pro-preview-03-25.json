    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the task (UQ, hallucination mitigation, scalability, benchmarks, safer deployment) by proposing the Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) mechanism outlined in the research idea. The methodology explicitly incorporates UQ techniques (entropy, MC dropout, ensembles) and intervention strategies mentioned in the idea. Furthermore, it acknowledges and plans to investigate key challenges identified in the literature review, such as computational overhead, threshold calibration, and evaluation metrics. The objectives, methods, and expected impact all tie back directly to the initial requirements and context provided."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The background, problem statement, proposed solution (UAD), and research objectives are articulated precisely and logically. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the UQ metrics, the UAD algorithm steps, intervention strategies, datasets, experimental design, and evaluation metrics, including relevant mathematical formulations. The structure is coherent and easy to follow, leaving minimal room for ambiguity regarding the research plan."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the specific implementation details, the combination of different UQ methods and intervention strategies within a unified framework, and the rigorous comparative evaluation plan offer value, the core concept of using uncertainty estimation during decoding to mitigate hallucinations is not fundamentally new. The provided literature review itself lists numerous 2023 papers with highly similar titles and concepts (e.g., 'Uncertainty-Aware Decoding for Mitigating Hallucinations', 'Uncertainty-Driven Decoding Strategies'). The proposal builds heavily on these existing ideas rather than introducing a groundbreaking approach. Its novelty lies more in the systematic comparison, integration, and detailed evaluation plan rather than conceptual originality."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in established UQ principles (entropy, MC dropout, ensembles) and standard LLM practices. The proposed UAD framework is logically constructed. The methodology is robust, featuring appropriate UQ metrics, plausible intervention strategies, standard benchmark datasets relevant to the problem, a comprehensive experimental design (including baselines, comparative analyses, ablations, sensitivity analysis), and a well-chosen suite of evaluation metrics covering factuality, quality, cost, and calibration. Technical formulations are presented correctly. The plan demonstrates a strong understanding of the technical challenges involved."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing pre-trained models (Llama 2, Mistral), standard datasets, and established UQ techniques. Implementation requires modifying decoding loops, which is achievable with standard ML engineering skills (e.g., using libraries like Hugging Face Transformers). The main challenges are the computational cost associated with some UQ methods (MC dropout, ensembles), which the proposal acknowledges and plans to investigate (e.g., lightweight ensembles), and the potential complexity of tuning intervention parameters and thresholds. Access to sufficient computational resources (GPUs) is necessary but standard for this type of research. Overall, the plan is realistic with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem in contemporary AI: the lack of reliability and prevalence of hallucinations in LLMs. Improving factual accuracy and providing mechanisms for uncertainty awareness is crucial for trustworthy AI deployment, especially in high-stakes domains mentioned in the task description (healthcare, law). A successful UAD framework would represent a substantial contribution, offering a proactive approach to mitigation, potentially leading to safer and more dependable LLM applications. The research directly contributes to the goals outlined in the workshop task description and addresses a key bottleneck in the field."
