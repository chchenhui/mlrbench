    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core task of mitigating hallucinations in LLMs using uncertainty quantification, as outlined in the task description and research idea. The proposed methods (UQ metrics like entropy, MC dropout, ensembles; decode-time intervention) are consistent with the research idea and reflect techniques discussed in the literature review. The proposal explicitly aims to create scalable methods, evaluate them on benchmarks, and consider computational overhead, all points mentioned in the task description and literature review challenges. It also correctly positions itself relative to existing work cited (Smith et al. 2023, Kim & O'Connor 2023)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed and structured overview of the UAD framework, including specific mathematical formulations for uncertainty metrics and the dynamic threshold. The intervention strategies are clearly explained, and the experimental design is comprehensive, outlining datasets, baselines, metrics, ablations, and implementation details. The structure is logical, making it easy to follow the proposed research plan. Minor details, like the exact reward shaping for RL, could be elaborated further, but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core concept of using uncertainty quantification at decoding time to mitigate hallucinations is well-represented in the very recent literature provided (all papers from 2023), including specific methods like MC dropout and ensembles. The proposal acknowledges this existing work. The novelty lies primarily in the specific *integration* of components into the UAD framework: the proposed dynamic thresholding mechanism based on moving averages, the combination of three distinct intervention strategies (evidence-constrained sampling, uncertainty-reweighted reranking, unreliability token injection), and the use of reinforcement learning to select interventions. While it builds heavily on recent advancements, this specific synthesis and the adaptive intervention selection offer a novel contribution, albeit more incremental than groundbreaking."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established uncertainty quantification techniques (entropy, MC dropout, ensembles) and standard LLM decoding practices. The proposed UAD framework is logically constructed. The mathematical formulations for UQ metrics and dynamic thresholding are correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant benchmarks, baselines (including prior art), comprehensive metrics (covering accuracy, quality, diversity, and overhead), ablation studies, and statistical analysis. Minor weaknesses include the inherent assumption that token-level uncertainty reliably predicts higher-level semantic hallucinations (which needs strong empirical validation) and the potential complexity/instability of training the RL policy for intervention selection."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The required resources (LLMs, compute for MC dropout/ensembles, datasets) are standard for ML research. The proposed techniques are based on existing methods. However, implementing MC dropout or ensembles at inference time significantly increases latency and computational cost, which is acknowledged but needs careful management and evaluation. Integrating the retriever for evidence-constrained sampling adds system complexity. Training the RL policy effectively requires careful reward engineering and tuning. While the plan is well-defined, achieving the target low latency overhead (<15%) while maintaining effectiveness, especially with ensembles or multiple MC passes, might be challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of hallucinations in LLMs, a major barrier to their trustworthy deployment in high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, finance), directly aligning with the task description's emphasis. Developing a proactive, decode-time mitigation strategy like UAD could represent a substantial advancement over purely post-hoc methods. The expected outcomes (reduced hallucination rates, practical algorithms, benchmarks, guidelines) would be valuable contributions. The plan to release an open-source toolkit and benchmark suite further enhances its potential impact on the research community and practitioners aiming for more reliable AI systems."
