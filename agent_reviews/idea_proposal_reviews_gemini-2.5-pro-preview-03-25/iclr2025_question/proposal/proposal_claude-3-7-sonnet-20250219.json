    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for scalable UQ methods, hallucination mitigation, and benchmarks for LLMs. It meticulously expands on the research idea, detailing the Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) mechanism, uncertainty metrics, and intervention strategies. Furthermore, it explicitly incorporates methods (entropy, MC dropout, ensembles) and addresses challenges (overhead, calibration, evaluation) highlighted in the provided literature review, citing relevant concepts and prior work mentioned in the background."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a strong motivation and clear objectives, followed by a detailed methodology broken down into distinct components (uncertainty estimation, thresholding, interventions, evaluation), and concluding with expected outcomes and impact. Key concepts are defined precisely, mathematical formulations are included where appropriate, and the evaluation plan is comprehensive and unambiguous. The language is academic and concise, making the proposal easy to understand."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the core idea of using uncertainty estimation during decoding to mitigate hallucinations is present in recent literature (as indicated by the provided 2023 review), the proposal offers novelty in its specific integrated framework. It combines multiple UQ techniques, proposes specific intervention strategies (evidence-constrained sampling, reranking, signaling), and introduces a potentially novel dynamic threshold calibration mechanism based on context and moving windows. The use of lightweight ensembles (LoRA) for this specific purpose also adds an element of practical novelty. However, it's more an innovative integration and refinement of existing ideas than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in uncertainty quantification (entropy, MC dropout, ensembles) and LLM decoding. The proposed methodology is well-justified, linking established UQ techniques to hallucination risk. The mathematical formulations appear correct. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, using standard datasets, metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. Minor weaknesses include the need for empirical validation of the dynamic thresholding approach and some implementation details (e.g., the evidence compatibility score C(xi, E)) requiring further specification, but the overall technical approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It requires standard LLM research resources (models, compute like A100s, datasets) which are typically available in research settings. The technical plan is ambitious but well-structured. The proposal acknowledges the computational overhead challenge and proposes mitigation strategies (lightweight ensembles). While implementing and tuning the integrated system (UQ, dynamic thresholds, interventions) presents engineering challenges and risks (e.g., threshold tuning, impact on quality), these appear manageable within a dedicated research project. The use of established techniques like LoRA enhances feasibility."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It tackles the critical and widely recognized problem of LLM hallucination, a major barrier to trustworthy AI deployment in high-stakes domains, directly aligning with the task description's emphasis. Successfully developing an effective UAD framework would represent a major advancement in reliable AI, potentially enabling safer use of LLMs in areas like healthcare, law, and education. The research contributes to both practical hallucination mitigation and theoretical understanding of uncertainty in generative models, with substantial potential impact."
