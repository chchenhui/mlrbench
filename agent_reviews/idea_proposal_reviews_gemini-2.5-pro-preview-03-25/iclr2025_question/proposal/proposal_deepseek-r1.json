    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description's focus on UQ for hallucination mitigation in LLMs, scalable methods, and benchmarks. It directly implements the research idea of Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD) by detailing the proposed uncertainty metrics, dynamic thresholds, and intervention strategies. Furthermore, it clearly builds upon the concepts presented in the literature review (UQ methods like entropy, MC dropout, ensembles; decoding interventions) and explicitly addresses the key challenges identified therein (computational overhead, threshold calibration, evaluation)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides substantial detail on data, uncertainty estimation techniques (including formulas), intervention strategies, and the experimental setup (baselines, metrics, ablations). The rationale is clear, and the language is precise. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact architecture of lightweight ensembles or the specifics of retrieval integration, but overall the proposal is very understandable and logically presented."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal integrates several existing or emerging techniques (token-level uncertainty metrics like entropy/MC dropout/ensembles, decoding-time interventions, evidence retrieval). While the specific combination, the dynamic threshold mechanism, and the systematic evaluation framework offer value, the core concept of using uncertainty signals during decoding to mitigate hallucinations is well-represented in the provided 2023 literature review (e.g., papers 1, 3, 4, 8, 10). The novelty is therefore more incremental, focusing on a specific implementation and empirical validation rather than introducing a fundamentally new approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on solid theoretical foundations in uncertainty quantification (entropy, Bayesian approximation via dropout/ensembles) and standard LLM practices. The methodology is rigorous, outlining specific UQ calculations, intervention mechanisms, and a comprehensive evaluation plan with appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Technical formulations (e.g., entropy) are correctly presented. Potential weaknesses, like the heuristic nature of the dynamic threshold or the indirect link between token uncertainty and factuality, are acknowledged implicitly or explicitly (e.g., evaluation subjectivity challenge), but the overall research design is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on accessible LLMs (GPT-3, LLaMA-2, Mistral) and standard benchmark datasets. The proposed techniques (UQ estimation, decoding modifications, retrieval integration) are technically complex but within the capabilities of current ML research environments. The proposal realistically identifies key challenges like computational overhead and threshold calibration and suggests plausible mitigation strategies (optimization, RL, expert annotation). While resource-intensive, the plan appears practical and implementable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and high-impact problem: hallucination in LLMs, which severely limits their trustworthiness and deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law, as highlighted in the task description. Developing a proactive mechanism to mitigate hallucinations during generation, as proposed, would be a major advancement. The potential impact is substantial, contributing valuable techniques, empirical insights, benchmarks, and potentially an open-source tool to enhance LLM reliability and safety."
