        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key questions posed in the workshop call, including scalable uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs, detecting and mitigating hallucinations, communicating uncertainty, and establishing benchmarks. The motivation explicitly highlights the need for UQ in foundation models for trustworthy AI, mirroring the task's central theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It outlines a specific framework (UAGM) with three distinct components (Uncertainty Estimation via Bayesian NNs, Adversarial Training for robustness, Uncertainty Communication). The motivation, expected outcomes, and potential impact are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While Bayesian methods for UQ and adversarial training for robustness are established concepts, their proposed integration within a unified framework specifically targeting UQ and hallucination mitigation in large-scale generative models (LLMs) is innovative. The combination aims to address these intertwined challenges simultaneously, offering a fresh perspective compared to tackling them in isolation. The emphasis on integrating technical UQ with user-centric communication further adds to its originality."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Applying Bayesian methods (like Bayesian NNs) and adversarial training to state-of-the-art LLMs is computationally extremely expensive and technically challenging to scale effectively. The proposal acknowledges the need for 'scalable and computationally efficient methods' as an *outcome*, indicating this is a major hurdle to overcome rather than a solved aspect. Integrating both complex techniques adds another layer of difficulty. While conceptually sound, achieving practical, scalable implementation requires substantial research effort and potentially new algorithmic breakthroughs."

Addressing uncertainty and hallucinations in foundation models is a critical bottleneck for their reliable deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law. Developing robust methods for UQ and mitigation, along with effective communication strategies, would represent a major advancement towards trustworthy AI, directly tackling pressing safety and reliability concerns in the field."
