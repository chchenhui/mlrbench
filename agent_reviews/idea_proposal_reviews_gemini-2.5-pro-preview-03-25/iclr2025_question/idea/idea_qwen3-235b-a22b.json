        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task focuses on uncertainty quantification (UQ) and hallucination mitigation in foundation models. The idea directly proposes a novel method for UQ (auxiliary network predicting per-token uncertainty) and uses it explicitly to mitigate hallucinations ('Uncertainty-Guided Knowledge Disengagement'). It addresses key workshop questions like creating scalable UQ methods ('lightweight design ensures scalability'), mitigating hallucinations while preserving creativity ('without sacrificing performance on creative tasks'), and using uncertainty for safer deployment ('Impacting safe deployment in legal/medical domains'). It directly tackles the core themes of the workshop call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem and the gap in existing solutions. The main idea is broken down into understandable components: the auxiliary uncertainty prediction network, the gating mechanism based on uncertainty, the concept of a 'fact-free generative mode', and the hybrid training objective. The expected outcomes and potential impact are explicitly stated. While specific implementation details (e.g., exact architecture, perturbation types) are omitted, the overall concept and mechanism are articulated with high precision and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While UQ and hallucination mitigation are active research areas, the proposed mechanism of *dynamically disengaging internal knowledge retrieval* based on *internally predicted uncertainty* during the decoding process itself appears novel. Most methods focus on post-hoc detection or rely on external knowledge. The concept of a model self-limiting its factual recall based on its own uncertainty estimate, transitioning to a 'fact-free' mode, is an innovative approach. The combination of contrastive perturbations for uncertainty, gating, and RL for factuality within this framework offers a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current machine learning techniques but presents moderate implementation challenges. Training an auxiliary network, using contrastive methods, implementing gating, and employing hybrid LM/RL objectives are all established practices. However, effectively calibrating the uncertainty prediction, setting appropriate context-adaptive thresholds, ensuring the 'fact-free' mode maintains coherence, and successfully tuning the complex hybrid objective will require significant experimentation and careful engineering. The claim of minimal inference overhead is plausible if the auxiliary network is truly lightweight, but the overall training complexity might be substantial. Empirical validation across diverse tasks (factual vs. creative) will be crucial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Hallucination is a critical barrier to the trustworthy deployment of large autoregressive models in high-stakes applications, a central theme of the task description. Developing methods to mitigate hallucinations intrinsically during generation, without heavy reliance on external resources or post-hoc checks, would represent a major advancement. If successful, this approach could substantially improve the reliability and safety of LLMs, directly addressing the core concerns highlighted in the workshop call regarding reliable AI and safer deployment."
