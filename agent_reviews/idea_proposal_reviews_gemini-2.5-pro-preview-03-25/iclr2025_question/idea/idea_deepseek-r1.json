        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for 'scalable and computationally efficient methods for estimating uncertainty in large language models,' which is the core focus of this idea (real-time UQ without multiple forward passes). It targets autoregressive models (LLMs), addresses uncertainty quantification directly, and mentions validation against hallucination rates, touching upon another key topic. The goal of enabling 'safer LLM deployment' also aligns with the task's emphasis on reliability and decision-making under risk."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly states the motivation (need for efficient UQ), the core mechanism (token-level aggregation of probabilities/hidden states via a learned function), the training approach (self-supervision), and the expected outcome (low-latency UQ). Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architecture of the aggregation function or the exact nature of the perturbations for self-supervision, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While UQ for LLMs is an active field, this proposal focuses on a lightweight, real-time approach by leveraging inherent model signals (token probabilities, hidden states) without requiring multiple forward passes, contrasting with slower methods like ensembles or MC dropout. The specific combination of aggregating token-level signals using a *learned* function trained via self-supervision on prediction inconsistencies appears innovative and offers a fresh perspective on efficient UQ."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Accessing token probabilities and hidden states during generation is standard in transformer models. Designing and implementing a lightweight aggregation function (e.g., a small neural network) is practical. The self-supervised training approach, while requiring careful design of perturbations and inconsistency measures, is technically achievable with current ML techniques. The main challenge lies in empirically demonstrating that this lightweight approach effectively captures meaningful uncertainty, but the core components are implementable with existing technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical bottleneck of computational cost in existing UQ methods for LLMs, which hinders their application in real-time, high-stakes domains. Providing a reliable, low-latency UQ score could significantly enhance trust, safety, and responsible deployment of LLMs in areas like healthcare, finance, and legal advice. Success would represent a major advancement towards making powerful generative models more dependable."
