        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses the core problem outlined in the task description: the need for scalable and computationally efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for large foundation models to detect issues like hallucination. It specifically targets the computational bottleneck of existing methods (ensembles, multiple forward passes) and proposes a solution tailored for large models, aligning perfectly with the workshop's key questions on scalable UQ and hallucination detection."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (high-confidence errors, computational cost of existing UQ) is well-defined. The core concept of a 'Calibrated Pseudo-Ensemble' using an uncertainty head trained on synthetic variability is understandable. Key aspects like parameter-efficient fine-tuning are mentioned. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact nature of the 'synthetic ensemble variability' techniques beyond examples like dropout, and the specifics of the calibration process, but the overall proposal is well-defined and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While approximating ensembles for UQ isn't entirely new (e.g., MC Dropout, some forms of pseudo-ensembles), the specific approach of training a dedicated uncertainty head to predict calibrated ensemble variance using synthetic variability, combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for large foundation models, offers a novel configuration. It's more of an innovative combination and practical adaptation of existing concepts rather than a fundamentally groundbreaking approach. The novelty lies in the specific training and calibration strategy tailored for efficiency in large models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. Adding specialized heads to models, using techniques like dropout/augmentation/perturbation for variability, and employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) are all established practices. Calibrating against a true ensemble on a subset of data is computationally possible, although potentially intensive depending on scale. The reliance on PEFT makes application to existing large models practical. The main challenge lies in empirically demonstrating that the synthetic variability and calibration effectively capture meaningful uncertainty related to hallucinations, but the technical components are generally implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Reliable and computationally efficient UQ for foundation models is a critical bottleneck for their safe deployment in high-stakes applications. Hallucination detection is a major challenge. If CPE proves effective, it could provide a practical, low-overhead solution applicable to widely deployed models, significantly improving their trustworthiness and enabling safer use. Addressing this specific efficiency gap for large models has substantial potential impact."
