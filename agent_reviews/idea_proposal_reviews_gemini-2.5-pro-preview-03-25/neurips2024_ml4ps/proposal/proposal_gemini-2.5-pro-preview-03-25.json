    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the ML & PS intersection, particularly the synergy between data-driven methods (SSL) and inductive biases (physics). The core idea of PG-SSL perfectly matches the provided research idea. The proposal effectively incorporates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself relative to PINNs, PGNNs, PGFM, and domain-specific physics-aware SSL (like DSSL). It tackles the key challenges identified (limited labeled data, physical consistency) and aligns with the goal of developing ML techniques tailored for scientific problems (ML for PS) while potentially informing ML development (PS for ML)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to objectives, methodology, evaluation, and impact. Key concepts like PG-SSL, physics-aware pretext tasks, and differentiable physics modules are explained well. The methodology section provides sufficient detail, including mathematical formulations for the loss functions and concrete examples of physics constraints. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are specific and easy to understand. There are no significant ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing concepts like SSL and physics-informed ML (PINNs, PGNNs), it proposes a novel synthesis: a *general framework* (PG-SSL) for integrating *diverse* physical constraints (conservation laws, PDE residuals, symmetries) into *various* SSL paradigms (contrastive, predictive) for pretraining across different scientific domains. This systematic integration and generalization beyond specific methods (like DSSL for materials) or goals (like solving PDEs with PINNs) constitutes a significant novel contribution. The design of specific physics-aware pretext tasks is also highlighted as an innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations from both self-supervised learning and physics-informed machine learning. The proposed methodology, combining standard SSL losses with physics-based penalty terms via differentiable modules, is technically sound and well-justified. The use of automatic differentiation for implementing physics constraints is appropriate. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The approach acknowledges related work and builds upon it logically. Potential challenges (e.g., implementing complex physics, tuning lambda) are inherent research questions rather than fundamental flaws in the approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. It leverages existing, mature technologies (deep learning frameworks, automatic differentiation). Potential data sources are identified. However, implementing accurate and stable differentiable physics modules for complex physical laws across different domains will require significant expertise and effort. Pretraining large models on large scientific datasets will be computationally intensive, requiring substantial resources. Tuning the hyperparameter lambda effectively might also require extensive experimentation. While ambitious, the plan is generally realistic, but resource requirements and implementation complexity lower the score slightly from excellent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and widely recognized challenges at the intersection of ML and physical sciences: the scarcity of labeled data and the need for physical consistency and trustworthiness in ML models. Success would lead to more data-efficient, reliable, and physically plausible models, potentially accelerating scientific discovery across various fields (fluids, climate, materials). It advances SSL methodology by providing a principled way to incorporate domain knowledge and contributes directly to the development of next-generation scientific foundation models, aligning perfectly with the workshop's themes and broader trends in the field."
