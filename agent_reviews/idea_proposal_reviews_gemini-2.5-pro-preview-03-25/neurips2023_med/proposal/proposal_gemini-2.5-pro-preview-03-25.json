    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges highlighted in the 'Medical Imaging meets NeurIPS' workshop description (data scarcity, robustness, reliability, interpretability gap). The methodology builds logically on the research idea (SSL + BNN for robustness/interpretability) and incorporates concepts and challenges identified in the literature review (Bayesian methods, uncertainty explanation, robustness-interpretability link, SSL in medical imaging). The objectives and significance sections explicitly connect the proposed work to the unmet needs in the field."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology and expected impact. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides detailed algorithmic steps, including technical formulations (InfoNCE, ELBO), data handling procedures, and a comprehensive experimental design with clear baselines and evaluation metrics. The rationale behind the chosen approaches (SSL for data efficiency, BNN for uncertainty/robustness, calibrated XAI for trust) is articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, primarily through the synergistic integration of existing techniques in a novel way tailored for clinical ML. While using SSL or BNNs individually for medical imaging isn't entirely new (as shown by Ali et al., 2021 using SSL+MCD), the proposed framework combines contrastive SSL (with specific emphasis on anatomically-aware augmentations) with more rigorous Bayesian inference (like VI) for fine-tuning. The most innovative aspect is the explicit development and evaluation of uncertainty-calibrated explainability methods, directly linking visual explanations to model confidence, which addresses a critical gap highlighted in recent literature (Najafi et al., 2025; Molchanova et al., 2025). It's more of an innovative synthesis and refinement than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations in self-supervised learning, Bayesian deep learning, and explainable AI, referencing key literature. The proposed two-stage methodology (SSL pre-training + Bayesian fine-tuning) is logical and well-justified for addressing data scarcity and uncertainty. The choice of specific algorithms (SimCLR/MoCo variants, VI/MCD, Grad-CAM adaptations) is appropriate. The experimental design is comprehensive, including multiple tasks, relevant baselines, and rigorous evaluation metrics covering task performance, robustness, uncertainty calibration, and interpretability. Technical formulations are included and appear correct. Potential challenges like VI scalability are implicitly acknowledged by including MCD as an alternative."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and publicly available datasets (BraTS, CheXpert). The core methods (SSL, VI/MCD, Grad-CAM) are implementable using standard deep learning frameworks. Simulating data scarcity is straightforward. The main potential challenges are the significant computational resources required for SSL pre-training and Bayesian inference (especially VI on 3D data) and the potentially broad scope of the evaluation plan (multiple tasks, modalities, robustness tests, calibration metrics, qualitative assessment). However, these challenges are common in state-of-the-art ML research and seem manageable within a well-resourced research environment. The plan is realistic overall."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and widely recognized challenges hindering the clinical translation of ML in medical imaging: data limitations, lack of robustness, poor uncertainty quantification, and the 'black-box' problem. By aiming to create more data-efficient, robust, reliable, and interpretable models, the research has substantial potential to enhance clinical trust, improve diagnostic safety and accuracy, and facilitate the adoption of AI tools in healthcare. The focus on uncertainty-calibrated explanations is particularly relevant for clinical decision support. Success would represent a meaningful advance for the field and directly contribute to the goals outlined in the workshop task description."
