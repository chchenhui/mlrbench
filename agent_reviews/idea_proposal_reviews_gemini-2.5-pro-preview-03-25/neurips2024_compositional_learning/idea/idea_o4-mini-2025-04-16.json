    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the fourth focus area of the workshop: 'What unique challenges arise when extending compositional learning strategies to continual learning environments, and what are the possible solutions?'. The idea explicitly tackles catastrophic forgetting ('memory') and proposes mechanisms for knowledge retention and reuse ('consolidation'), which are mentioned challenges. Furthermore, it employs modularity (adapters), a topic discussed in the second and third focus areas, within the context of compositional continual learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (modular adapters, prototype memory/replay, gating, consolidation loss), evaluation plan, and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The overall mechanism of using adapter prototypes for replay in a compositional continual setting is understandable. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact implementation details (e.g., prototype representation, gating mechanism specifics, loss formulation), but the high-level concept is well-defined and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While modularity (adapters), replay, and prototypes are existing concepts in machine learning and continual learning, their specific combination and application here are novel. Using prototypes derived from *adapter activations* as a basis for replay and consolidation, specifically to maintain *compositional* capabilities in a *continual* learning setting, represents a fresh perspective. It's an innovative synthesis of known techniques applied to the challenging intersection of compositional and continual learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Lightweight adapters are standard, memory banks for prototypes are implementable (though size needs management), gating networks are common (though training requires care), and replay mechanisms are well-understood. The proposed evaluation benchmarks (SCAN, CLEVR) are appropriate. Potential challenges include optimizing the prototype storage, ensuring the gating mechanism generalizes well to unseen compositions, and effectively integrating all components, but these appear solvable within current research capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the critical and difficult problem of enabling systems to learn compositional skills continually without forgetting, which is essential for building truly adaptive AI agents capable of operating in dynamic environments. Success would represent a meaningful contribution towards overcoming catastrophic forgetting while simultaneously improving compositional generalization, impacting fields like robotics, NLP, and reinforcement learning where incremental skill acquisition and recombination are vital."
