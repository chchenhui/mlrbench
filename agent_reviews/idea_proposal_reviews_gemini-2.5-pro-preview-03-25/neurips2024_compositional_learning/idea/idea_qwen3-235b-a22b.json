        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop call). It directly addresses Topic 3 ('does such modularity in structures guarantee compositional generalization and is there any correspondence between them?') by proposing to investigate the link between modularity types (sparsity, prompts, MoE) and compositional generalization using causality. It also aligns strongly with Topic 2 ('Can we identify or design compositional learning methods that are transferable across different domains and compatible with existing foundation models?') by aiming for a model-agnostic strategy via self-supervision and modularity (MoE mentioned explicitly). Furthermore, it touches upon Topic 1 by exploring *why* modularity might lead to compositionality (causal link) and motivates the work with relevance to Topic 4 (dynamic environments, continual learning)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core proposal (two steps: identify primitives via contrastive learning, enforce modular routing), evaluation plan (synthetic benchmark, theoretical analysis), and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The use of specific techniques like self-supervision, contrastive learning, and MoE adds clarity. Minor ambiguities might exist in the precise definition of 'causal abstractions of compositional rules' and how they are operationalized in the self-supervised objective, but the overall research direction is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While modular learning and self-supervision for compositionality are existing research areas, the core novelty lies in explicitly using self-supervision to enforce an alignment between modular components and *causal abstractions* of compositional rules. Proposing causality as the guiding principle for module specialization in this context is innovative. Furthermore, systematically evaluating different modularity types (sparsity, prompts, MoE) against compositional generalization through a dedicated causal benchmark (*CausalComposiBench*) and theoretical analysis adds significant novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current ML techniques. Self-supervised methods (contrastive learning), modular architectures (MoE, adapters), and synthetic data generation are established practices. However, designing a robust self-supervised objective that effectively captures and enforces alignment with 'causal abstractions' is non-trivial and may require significant experimentation. Creating the *CausalComposiBench* requires careful design to ensure it properly tests the intended causal compositional properties. The theoretical analysis linking specialization to invariance could also be challenging. Overall, it's feasible but requires considerable research effort and careful implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. It addresses the critical and persistent challenge of compositional generalization in machine learning, particularly for foundation models facing OOD scenarios and dynamic environments. Understanding the relationship between structural modularity and functional compositionality (especially through a causal lens) is a fundamental question. If successful, the proposed method could offer a principled, model-agnostic way to build more robust and adaptable models. The insights gained and the potential benchmark dataset would be valuable contributions to the field, impacting areas like continual learning, vision-language tasks, and reasoning."
