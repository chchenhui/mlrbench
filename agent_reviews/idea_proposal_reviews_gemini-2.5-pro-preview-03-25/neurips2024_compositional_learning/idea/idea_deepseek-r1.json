        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop call). It directly addresses the third focus area: 'Does such modularity in structures guarantee compositional generalization and is there any correspondence between them?'. The proposal explicitly mentions investigating various modular learning approaches (adapters, prompts, sparsity) using both theoretical and empirical contributions, exactly as requested by the workshop topic. It also aligns with the overall theme of understanding and improving compositional generalization, particularly in the context of modern architectures like foundation models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly states the research gap. The main idea outlines a specific methodology: a systematic evaluation framework, target modular strategies, domains (vision, language, RL), experimental setup (controlled experiments, OOD testing), quantification metrics (parameter isolation, sparsity), and theoretical analysis. The expected outcomes are also clearly articulated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While research exists on both modularity and compositional generalization separately, this proposal's novelty lies in its systematic, comparative investigation into the *direct relationship* between structural modularity (quantified via specific metrics) and functional compositional generalization across multiple domains (vision, language, RL) and modular strategies (adapters, prompts, sparsity). It moves beyond assuming modularity helps, aiming to rigorously test *if*, *how*, and *when* it does, including identifying failure modes. The combination of empirical correlation and theoretical analysis focused specifically on this structure-function link is innovative."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed empirical evaluation using standard modular techniques (adapters, prompts, sparsity) and evaluation protocols (OOD testing) is largely feasible with current ML technology and methods. However, conducting this systematically across multiple domains (vision, language, RL), potentially involving large foundation models, and developing robust quantitative metrics for 'modularity' requires significant computational resources, careful experimental design, and potentially substantial engineering effort. The theoretical analysis component is also feasible but depends on the chosen framework. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable, though resource-intensive."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant and fundamental question in machine learning: does structural modularity directly lead to better compositional generalization? Understanding this link is critical for designing more robust, interpretable, and efficient AI systems, especially foundation models intended for diverse, dynamic environments. Providing empirical evidence, identifying failure cases, and developing guidelines for leveraging modularity would be a major contribution, potentially redefining design principles for achieving reliable generalization and addressing a key challenge highlighted by the workshop."
