        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Paths Forward' theme of the workshop call by tackling the challenges of extending compositional learning to continual learning environments. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core concepts outlined in the research idea (drift detection, incremental learning, adaptive composition). Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon recent work cited in the literature review (MCD-DD, DriftLens, Neighbor-Searching Discrepancy), positioning the proposed work within the current research landscape and addressing the identified key challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background section effectively motivates the problem, and the research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section is logically structured, detailing the design principles, algorithmic steps, and theoretical underpinnings for each proposed module (CDD, Incremental Learning, Adaptive Composition). The experimental design is comprehensive, outlining datasets, baselines, metrics, and implementation details. The language is precise, and the overall structure facilitates easy understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it leverages existing concepts like concept drift detection, generative replay, parameter isolation, and meta-learning, its novelty lies in the specific adaptation and integration of these techniques for the challenging intersection of *compositional* and *continual* learning. Proposing drift detection specifically on compositional component embeddings and relational graphs (CDD), and using meta-learning to adapt composition rules based on drift signals (Meta-Compose Network), represents a fresh approach distinct from prior work that typically handles drift globally or assumes static composition rules. The focus on dynamic adaptation of both primitives and their combination rules in a CL context is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (MMD, VAEs, attention mechanisms, CL principles) and methods from relevant fields (drift detection, incremental learning). The proposed methodology, including Compositional Drift Detection (CDD) using MMD on component embeddings and relational graphs, generative replay for incremental learning, and meta-learned adaptive composition, is technically plausible and well-justified. The mathematical formulations provided are appropriate, although some details (e.g., specific kernel choices, meta-learner architecture) would need further specification during implementation. The overall approach is logically coherent and grounded in existing research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The individual components (object detection, embedding learning, MMD, VAEs, meta-learning) rely on existing techniques. However, integrating these diverse components into a cohesive framework (DyCA) that works effectively in a continual learning setting will be complex and require significant engineering effort and careful hyperparameter tuning (e.g., drift thresholds, loss weights, meta-learner stability). Modifying datasets like CLEVRER for temporal shifts is feasible but requires careful design. While challenging, the plan is generally realistic for a well-resourced research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: enabling AI systems, particularly foundation models, to maintain compositional generalization capabilities in dynamic, non-stationary environments. This is a major limitation of current methods and a key barrier to real-world deployment. Success would represent a substantial advancement in both compositional learning and continual learning, potentially leading to more robust and adaptable AI systems for applications like robotics and autonomous systems. The research directly aligns with the workshop's core themes and has the potential to generate valuable theoretical insights, practical methods, and useful benchmarks."
