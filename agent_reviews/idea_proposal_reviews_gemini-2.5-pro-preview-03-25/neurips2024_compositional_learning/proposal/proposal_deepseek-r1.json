    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Paths Forward' topic from the task description, focusing on the challenges of extending compositional learning to continual learning environments. The core idea of dynamic component adaptation perfectly matches the research idea provided. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates recent methods (MCD-DD, DriftLens) highlighted in the literature review for concept drift detection and explicitly aims to tackle the key challenges listed (dynamic adaptation, drift detection, incremental learning, adaptive composition, evaluation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology is broken down logically into data collection, the three core modules of the DCA-CCL framework (drift detection, incremental learning, adaptive composition), and experimental design. Each module's function is explained, and key techniques and even high-level mathematical formulations are provided. Baselines, metrics, and implementation details are specified, leaving little ambiguity about the research plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality and innovation. While individual components like concept drift detection, generative replay, parameter isolation, and attention mechanisms exist, their integration into a unified framework specifically designed for *continual compositional learning* is novel. The focus on adapting both the components (primitives) and the composition rules dynamically in response to detected drift within a compositional setting represents a fresh perspective. Leveraging very recent (2024) drift detection methods and proposing a drift-aware adaptive attention mechanism further enhances the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in compositional learning, continual learning, and concept drift. The methodology leverages established techniques (VAE for replay, parameter isolation) and recent state-of-the-art methods for drift detection (MCD-DD, DriftLens). The proposed integration of these components is logical. The mathematical formulations, though brief, appear correct at a conceptual level. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics. A minor point is that the specific formulation for the drift-aware attention mechanism might require further theoretical justification or empirical exploration, but it is a plausible approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core methods (contrastive learning, VAEs, attention, masking) are standard deep learning techniques. The required computational resources (A100 GPUs, PyTorch) are typical for ML research. However, challenges exist: 1) Creating or adapting dynamic compositional benchmarks (CLEVR-Dynamic extension, NLP procedural tasks, dynamic MiniGrid) requires significant effort, especially drift annotation. 2) Integrating the three distinct modules smoothly and effectively tuning the combined system might be complex. 3) Reproducing and applying the very recent drift detection methods could pose minor hurdles. Overall, the plan is realistic for a well-resourced research project, but non-trivial engineering effort is required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current compositional learning models â€“ their brittleness in dynamic, non-stationary environments. This is a major barrier to real-world deployment. Successfully enabling continual adaptation for compositional systems would be a major advancement, directly relevant to the workshop's theme and with broad implications for fields like robotics, NLP, and autonomous systems where environments constantly change. The potential to reduce retraining costs also adds societal relevance."
