    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple core topics of the workshop: 'Structure-inducing learning' through 'Geometric priors' and manifold representations, 'Structure-preserving learning' via 'SE(3) equivariant operators', and implicitly touches on 'Dynamical systems on manifolds' through trajectory generation via Riemannian optimization. The application domain, robotics, is explicitly mentioned as relevant in the workshop motivation. The proposal focuses squarely on grounding learning in geometry (manifolds, group transformations) for a practical problem, fitting the workshop's central theme perfectly."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-defined. The motivation, main technical approach (manifold-aware representation, differentiable constraints, SE(3) equivariance, Riemannian optimization), and the proposed two-stage architecture are articulated well. The specific manifolds (SE(2), SO(3)) and claimed benefits are mentioned. While specific implementation details (e.g., exact network layers, loss functions) are omitted, the core concepts and methodology are communicated effectively with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While concepts like learning-based motion planning, configuration space manifolds, equivariant networks, and Riemannian optimization exist individually, the proposed integration is innovative. Specifically, the combination of using SE(3) equivariant networks to map workspace obstacles onto the configuration space manifold and then generating geodesic trajectories via Riemannian optimization within a unified learning framework offers a fresh perspective. It represents a thoughtful synthesis and application of advanced geometric deep learning techniques to robotics, rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and knowledge. Libraries and theoretical foundations for equivariant networks (like SE(3)), manifold representations, and Riemannian optimization exist. However, implementing the complete system poses moderate challenges. Integrating these components effectively, ensuring numerical stability of Riemannian optimization, handling complex robot kinematics and high-dimensional configuration spaces, and acquiring necessary training data require significant expertise and engineering effort. It is ambitious but achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Motion planning is a fundamental and persistent challenge in robotics. Improving planning speed (claimed 60% reduction), generalization to new environments, and ensuring physical plausibility through geometric grounding would be major advancements. Success in this research could lead to more efficient, reliable, and versatile robots, impacting various applications from industrial automation to autonomous navigation. It addresses a critical problem with a potentially powerful approach."
