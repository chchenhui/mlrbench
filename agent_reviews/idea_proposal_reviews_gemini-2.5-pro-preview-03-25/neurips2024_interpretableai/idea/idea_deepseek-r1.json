    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the need for inherently interpretable models, explicitly tackling the issue of unfaithful post-hoc explanations mentioned in the task. It focuses on incorporating domain knowledge (a key question posed) into model design for specific high-stakes domains like healthcare and materials science, which are highlighted examples in the task description. The goal of achieving verifiable, domain-aligned reasoning paths fits perfectly within the scope of building trustworthy and transparent AI systems as outlined."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (limitations of post-hoc methods, need for domain alignment) is clearly stated. The core proposal (Domain-Guided NAS) is well-defined, and the intended mechanisms (structural priors, constrained optimization, symbolic rule injection) are specified. The desired outcomes (modular components, verifiable paths) and validation domains are explicit. While implementation details could be further elaborated, the overall concept, goals, and approach are crystal clear and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While NAS, interpretability, and domain-knowledge integration exist as separate concepts, combining them in this specific way – using NAS explicitly guided by domain rules as structural priors to *automatically design* inherently interpretable architectures with verifiable reasoning paths – offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond standard NAS (performance-focused) or typical interpretability methods by proposing automated architectural design constrained by domain logic for transparency. The concept of discovering modular, human-understandable components via this guided search is innovative."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. NAS is computationally intensive, and adding complex domain constraints will exacerbate this. Translating domain knowledge (e.g., medical guidelines, physical laws) into formal, machine-usable constraints for a NAS search space is non-trivial and domain-specific. Implementing and optimizing constrained NAS with symbolic rule injection requires advanced techniques. Verifying the interpretability and domain alignment of generated architectures automatically within the search loop is also challenging. Significant research effort and potentially new algorithmic developments would be needed, making it moderately feasible rather than straightforward."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of building trustworthy AI for high-stakes domains where interpretability and alignment with established principles are paramount. Successfully developing models that are inherently interpretable *because* their architecture encodes domain knowledge would be a major advancement over potentially unreliable post-hoc methods. It directly tackles the performance-interpretability trade-off and could lead to safer, more reliable, and more readily adopted AI systems in critical areas like healthcare and scientific discovery."
