    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for inherently interpretable large-scale models, moving beyond post-hoc methods. The methodology precisely implements the research idea of multi-level selective knowledge distillation (KD) to create 'interpretability islands'. It explicitly references and builds upon the concepts and specific papers mentioned in the literature review (e.g., selective KD, multi-level KD, concept-based, path extraction, neural-symbolic), and tackles the key challenges identified therein. The objectives and significance resonate strongly with the core themes and questions posed in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and evaluation plan. Research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology breaks down the complex framework into understandable components (SMI, Concept KD, Path Extraction, Neural-Symbolic Integration, Integrated Training), providing technical details and mathematical formulations for key steps. The experimental design, including datasets, models, baselines, and metrics, is clearly outlined. While minor details like the exact nature of ablation for SMI or specifics of the transparent student architectures could be slightly more elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several recent, distinct KD-based interpretability techniques (concept-based, path extraction, neural-symbolic, selective, multi-level) into a single, unified framework. The core novelty lies in this systematic integration and the proposed use of Shapley-based Selective Module Identification (SMI) to guide the multi-level distillation process specifically for foundation models. While it builds heavily on existing ideas cited in the literature review rather than introducing a fundamentally new technique, the specific combination, the SMI guidance mechanism, and the targeted application to foundation models represent a fresh and innovative approach within the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established machine learning concepts like knowledge distillation, Shapley values, rule learning, and program synthesis. The methodology is technically detailed, with appropriate mathematical formulations for the core components (losses, importance scores). The integration of different techniques is logically motivated. The reliance on recent 2023 papers is suitable for cutting-edge research, though it implies some techniques might be less extensively validated than older methods. Minor points, such as the precise implementation of module ablation for Shapley values or assumptions about concept availability, could be further detailed, but the overall technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires access to significant computational resources for training/fine-tuning foundation models and performing potentially expensive calculations like Shapley values (SMI). Integrating the diverse components (concept learning, rule extraction, program synthesis, KD) into a cohesive framework demands substantial engineering effort. While each sub-problem uses known techniques, their combination and scaling require careful implementation. The evaluation plan, including human studies, is standard but resource-intensive. Key risks involve the computational cost of SMI, the effectiveness of distillation for complex modules, and achieving a good balance between interpretability and performance. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable within a well-resourced research environment."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely challenge of interpretability in foundation models, a major barrier to their trustworthy deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, as highlighted in the task description. Successfully creating 'interpretability islands' could provide tailored transparency for different stakeholders, enhancing trust, auditability, and compliance (e.g., GDPR). The research has the potential to advance mechanistic interpretability and provide practical tools for building inherently more understandable large AI systems, representing a substantial contribution to the field."
