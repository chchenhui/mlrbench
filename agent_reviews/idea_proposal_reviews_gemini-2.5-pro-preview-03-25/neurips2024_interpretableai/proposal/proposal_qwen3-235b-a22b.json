    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of interpreting large-scale foundation models, as highlighted in the task description. The methodology systematically implements the research idea of multi-level knowledge distillation (concept-based, decision path, neural-symbolic). It explicitly builds upon and integrates concepts from the provided literature review (e.g., concept distillation, path extraction, selective distillation, performance-interpretability trade-off), and aims to tackle the key challenges identified therein. The proposal also connects directly to the workshop's key questions regarding large models, domain knowledge, assessment, limitations, and legal needs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology, experiments, and impact. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section clearly outlines the proposed InterpKD framework, its components, the mathematical formulations for key losses, and the training protocol. The experimental design is detailed, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and evaluation steps. The language is precise and technical, suitable for the intended audience, with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like concept-based distillation, decision path extraction via attention, and neural-symbolic integration exist in recent literature (as shown in the review), the novelty lies in their systematic integration into a single, multi-level framework (InterpKD). The dynamic component identification based on impact scores and the specific combination of techniques applied to foundation models represent a fresh approach. It's not proposing a completely new paradigm but offers a significant and innovative synthesis of state-of-the-art methods, clearly distinguishing itself from applying these techniques in isolation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established machine learning principles like knowledge distillation, concept bottlenecks, attention mechanisms, gradient-based importance scores (SHAP/IG), and neural-symbolic techniques. The proposed methodology, including the specific loss functions and training strategy, is technically plausible and well-justified based on prior work. The mathematical formulations are clearly presented and appear correct. Minor weaknesses include the potential complexity of optimizing the combined loss function and the inherent assumption that attention weights perfectly capture decision paths, which might require further validation or refinement. Overall, the technical approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and standard research resources (datasets, compute, foundation models). The methodology uses existing techniques, although their integration requires significant engineering effort. The experimental plan is well-defined. However, challenges exist: optimizing the complex multi-objective distillation process, ensuring scalability to the very largest foundation models, defining appropriate concepts across diverse domains, and achieving the ambitious dual goals of >95% teacher performance and 2x interpretability metrics simultaneously. These factors introduce moderate implementation risks, making the feasibility good but not excellent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of black-box foundation models, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance where transparency is paramount. Developing inherently interpretable yet powerful models, as proposed, could enable trustworthy AI deployment, facilitate regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act), and potentially lead to new scientific insights via concept discovery. By aiming to overcome the limitations of post-hoc methods and bridge the gap between performance and interpretability, the research has substantial potential to advance the field of responsible AI."
