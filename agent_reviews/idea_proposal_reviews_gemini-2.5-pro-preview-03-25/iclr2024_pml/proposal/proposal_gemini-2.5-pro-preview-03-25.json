    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on bridging technical privacy methods (DP, FL) with privacy regulations (GDPR) and emphasizes transparency/auditability. The proposal meticulously expands on the core research idea, detailing each component (tagging, dynamic allocation, aggregation, audit log). It effectively situates the work within the provided literature, referencing key papers (e.g., Xu et al. Gboard, Kiani et al., Xu et al. PGU review) and explicitly tackling identified challenges like the privacy-utility trade-off, regulatory compliance, and adaptive budget allocation. The objectives, methodology, and expected impact consistently reinforce the central theme of regulation-sensitive DP in FL."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It follows a logical structure, making it easy to understand the background, problem, proposed solution, and evaluation plan. Key concepts like feature sensitivity, dynamic budget allocation, and the role of the audit log are explained precisely. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the algorithmic steps, including formulas for budget allocation and noise calibration, experimental setup, baselines, and evaluation metrics. There is minimal ambiguity, and the overall presentation is highly professional and immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While components like Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, feature-level DP concepts, and secure aggregation exist, the core innovation lies in the *integration* and *motivation*: dynamically allocating DP budgets at the feature level based specifically on *automated regulatory sensitivity tagging* within an FL context. This explicit link between the technical DP mechanism and external legal/regulatory risk classifications, combined with the automated tagging and integrated audit log for compliance verification, represents a fresh approach. It clearly distinguishes itself from standard uniform DP and the time-adaptive DP cited in the literature (Kiani et al.). The combination addresses a specific gap in making DP-FL more aligned with real-world compliance needs."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established foundations like FedAvg, DP principles (Gaussian mechanism, composition), and secure aggregation. The proposed mechanism for dynamic budget allocation based on sensitivity scores is logical, and the description of noise injection calibrated to per-feature budgets is technically correct in principle. However, some areas could benefit from further justification or detail. The proposal acknowledges the need for appropriate DP composition (mentioning RDP/GDP accountants) but doesn't specify the exact method. The practical complexity of implementing accurate feature-wise clipping and noise injection, especially within secure aggregation protocols and for high-dimensional models, might be understated. The reliance on the accuracy of the automated tagging module is significant, and potential error handling isn't discussed. While generally well-founded, these points slightly reduce the score from excellent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It relies on existing technologies (FL frameworks, DP libraries, NLP tools, secure aggregation protocols) and proposes using accessible benchmark datasets. Simulating the environment is standard practice. However, achieving high accuracy with the automated sensitivity tagging across diverse datasets might be difficult. Implementing feature-level DP correctly within a secure aggregation framework adds significant complexity compared to standard DP-FL. The aggregator's computational load increases. While the core ideas are implementable, significant engineering effort is required, and the ambitious 30% utility gain target needs empirical validation. The audit log's immutability can be achieved feasibly (e.g., cryptographic hashing) without necessarily requiring complex blockchain integration."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the gap between theoretical DP guarantees and the practical, risk-based requirements of data protection regulations like GDPR in the context of FL. Successfully aligning DP mechanisms with regulatory sensitivity could substantially improve the utility-privacy trade-off, making privacy-preserving FL more viable for sensitive applications (healthcare, finance). The focus on providing verifiable audit logs directly addresses regulatory demands for accountability and transparency. This work has strong potential to influence both academic research (by offering a more context-aware DP framework) and industry practice (by facilitating compliant adoption of FL), aligning perfectly with the interdisciplinary goals outlined in the task description."
