    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on privacy regulation (GDPR), efficient privacy-preserving ML, federated learning for data minimization, differential privacy practice, and the relationship between privacy, auditability, and transparency. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the NLP-based tagging, dynamic budget allocation, secure aggregation, and audit log components. Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the privacy-utility trade-off, regulatory compliance, and adaptive budget allocation, positioning itself effectively within the current research landscape by citing relevant recent work (e.g., Kiani et al., 2025 on time-adaptive DP)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The research objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology is broken down into logical, well-explained components (Feature Sensitivity Classification, Dynamic Privacy Budget Allocation, DP Secure Aggregation, Privacy Accounting & Audit Logging, Experimental Validation), including specific technical details like the budget allocation formula, noise calculation, and RDP accounting. The rationale connecting regulatory needs to the technical solution is clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow. While minor implementation details (e.g., specific NLP architecture choices, secure aggregation protocol specifics beyond naming SSS) could be further elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. The core concept of dynamically allocating differential privacy budgets based on *regulatory sensitivity* of features, particularly using automated NLP-based tagging, is a fresh perspective compared to standard uniform or purely time-adaptive DP approaches mentioned in the literature review. Integrating this with secure aggregation and a verifiable, immutable audit log specifically designed for GDPR compliance adds further novelty. While individual components (DP, FL, NLP, audit logs) exist, their synthesis to address regulation-sensitive privacy in FL is innovative and clearly distinguished from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established foundations like Federated Averaging, Gaussian mechanism for DP, RDP for composition, and secure aggregation techniques. The methodology is generally well-defined, and the technical formulations for clipping and noise addition are standard and correct. However, the proposed dynamic budget allocation formula (direct proportionality to sensitivity score) is simple and ensures the total budget constraint via basic composition, but its optimality or theoretical justification beyond simplicity isn't deeply explored; alternative allocation strategies might yield better utility. The reliance on the accuracy of the NLP sensitivity classifier is a key assumption requiring careful validation. The use of standard RDP composition is sound but potentially not the tightest possible bound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technologies. NLP tagging with lightweight models, DP mechanisms, RDP accounting, and audit logs (blockchain/Merkle trees) are all implementable. The experimental plan is detailed and uses accessible (though potentially restricted, like MIMIC-III) datasets. However, implementing secure aggregation (like Shamir's Secret Sharing) efficiently at scale can be challenging regarding communication and computation overhead, posing a moderate risk. The accuracy and generalization of the NLP sensitivity classifier also need careful empirical validation. The overall plan is realistic for a research project but contains non-trivial engineering and validation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: aligning technical privacy-preserving ML methods (DP in FL) with practical legal and regulatory requirements (GDPR's principles of data minimization and accountability). Successfully developing such a framework could significantly improve the privacy-utility trade-off, enhance trust, and facilitate the adoption of FL in highly regulated and sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. The proposed verifiable audit log directly tackles the crucial aspect of transparency and compliance verification. The potential contributions to both technical practice and regulatory alignment are substantial."
