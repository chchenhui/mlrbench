        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly lists 'Federated learning for data minimization' as a topic of interest for the workshop. The idea directly addresses this topic, incorporating related concepts like 'Differential privacy theory and practice', 'Efficient methods for privacy preserving machine learning', and the 'Relationship of privacy regulation (such as GDPR) to machine learning', all of which are mentioned in the workshop's topics of interest. It fits squarely within the scope and aims of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main idea (FL + DP for data minimization), methodology steps (DP in FL, efficient aggregation, scalability), expected outcomes, and potential impact are laid out logically. The core concept is easy to grasp. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific 'novelty' of the framework (e.g., what specific DP mechanisms or aggregation protocols are proposed beyond existing ones), but the overall research direction and goals are well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea has some originality but also shares significant similarities with existing work. Combining Federated Learning with Differential Privacy (DP-FL) is a well-established research direction for privacy-preserving machine learning. The novelty seems to lie in specifically framing and optimizing this combination for the principle of 'data minimization' and potentially in the 'optimized aggregation protocols'. However, the description doesn't detail *how* these protocols are novel or how the framework fundamentally differs from existing DP-FL approaches beyond its stated focus. It appears more like an application and refinement of existing techniques towards a specific regulatory principle rather than introducing a groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Federated Learning frameworks exist, and implementing Differential Privacy mechanisms within them is a known, albeit challenging, task. Research on optimizing aggregation protocols and ensuring scalability/robustness is ongoing but builds on existing methods. Standard ML research resources (compute, datasets for simulation) would be required. The main challenges lie in effectively balancing the privacy-utility trade-off inherent in DP and achieving robust performance across diverse client environments, but these are common research challenges in the field, not fundamental roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Data minimization is a core tenet of major privacy regulations like GDPR, and developing technical solutions like FL to operationalize this principle is highly relevant. Improving the privacy, efficiency, and practicality of FL, especially with regulatory compliance in mind, addresses an important need. Providing practical guidelines for deployment would further enhance its significance for industry adoption. Success could lead to meaningful contributions in enabling privacy-preserving collaborative learning in sensitive domains."
