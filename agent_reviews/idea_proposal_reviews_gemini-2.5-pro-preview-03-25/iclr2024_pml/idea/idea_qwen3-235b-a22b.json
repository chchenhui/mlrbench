    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description (workshop call for papers). It directly addresses several key topics listed, including 'Efficient methods for privacy preserving machine learning', 'Differential privacy theory and practice', and 'Privacy for large language models'. It also touches upon the relationship between privacy regulation (mentioning GDPR) and ML, and implicitly addresses privacy in ML systems. The focus on efficiency, privacy, and LLMs aligns perfectly with the workshop's aims."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (privacy risks in LLMs, limitations of DP-SGD) is well-defined. The core components (adaptive DP, knowledge distillation, data minimization) are explicitly listed. The goal (improving privacy-utility-computation trade-off) and validation plan are mentioned. However, the specifics of the 'adaptive' mechanism (e.g., how exactly loss curvature or gradient variance translates into noise/clipping adjustments) and the integration details of active learning could be slightly more elaborated for perfect clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While DP for LLMs, knowledge distillation for privacy, and adaptive DP mechanisms exist individually, the proposed combination is innovative. Specifically, tailoring an adaptive DP mechanism based on the learning trajectory (loss curvature, gradient variance) for LLMs, and combining it synergistically with knowledge distillation and active learning for data minimization presents a fresh approach to the specific challenge of efficient private LLM training. The novelty lies more in the specific adaptive strategy and the integrated framework rather than entirely new concepts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Each component (DP, KD, Active Learning) is based on existing techniques. However, implementing DP for LLMs is computationally expensive, and adding adaptive logic increases complexity. Tuning the adaptive parameters (based on loss curvature/gradient variance) will require careful experimentation. Integrating active learning adds another layer. Significant computational resources (typical for LLM research) are required. While challenging, it seems achievable within a well-equipped research setting."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing privacy concerns in LLMs is a critical and timely problem, given their widespread adoption and potential use of sensitive data. Improving the trade-off between privacy, model utility, and computational efficiency for LLMs would be a major advancement. Success could enable the responsible deployment of LLMs in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, fostering trust and compliance with regulations like GDPR, thus having substantial real-world impact."
