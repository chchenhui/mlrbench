    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed for the workshop, including 'Efficient methods for privacy preserving machine learning', 'Differential privacy theory and practice', and 'Privacy for large language models'. The motivation also connects to 'Relationship of privacy regulation (such as GDPR, DMA) to machine learning', and the expected outcome of open-source tools relates to 'Relationship between privacy, transparency, auditability, verifiability'. The focus on scalable DP for LLMs is highly relevant to the workshop's theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the problem (privacy risks and computational cost of DP in LLMs), the proposed solution (applying DP to PEFT parameters), the methodology (theoretical analysis, empirical evaluation), and the expected outcomes (scalable framework, benchmarks, tools). The core concept of integrating DP with PEFT is immediately understandable, and the specific techniques mentioned (LoRA, adapters) add precision. There are no significant ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While DP and PEFT are existing concepts, the specific approach of applying DP *only* to the parameters updated during PEFT (like LoRA adapters) to achieve scalability and maintain utility in LLMs is a novel and clever combination. It's not a completely new paradigm but offers a fresh perspective on applying DP to large models, distinct from applying DP-SGD to the entire model or full fine-tuning. It addresses the limitations of prior methods in a targeted way."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly practical and implementable. PEFT techniques are widely available and computationally much cheaper than full fine-tuning. Implementing DP mechanisms like noise injection and gradient clipping within the PEFT framework is technically achievable. Access to pre-trained LLMs and standard ML evaluation benchmarks makes empirical validation straightforward. The theoretical analysis builds on existing DP literature. Required resources are significantly less than applying DP to full model training, making it highly feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Ensuring the privacy of LLMs is a critical challenge hindering their adoption in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Existing DP methods often suffer from high computational costs or significant utility degradation for LLMs. This proposal directly targets these bottlenecks by proposing a scalable and potentially more utility-preserving approach. Success would represent a major advancement in deploying privacy-preserving LLMs, aligning AI development with regulatory requirements and societal expectations."
