        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description (R0-FoMo Workshop). It directly addresses the core theme of improving the robustness of few-shot learning in large foundation models. Specifically, it proposes a novel method leveraging adversarial training concepts repurposed for the few-shot setting, focusing on prompt perturbations, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's interest in 'Novel methods to improve few-shot robustness', 'Adversarial few-shot or zero-shot robustness', and 'Prompt learning'. It also touches upon using unlabeled data and aims for safer deployment, connecting to 'Responsible AI' aspects mentioned in the call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with a well-defined motivation, main concept (Meta-APP), and a high-level methodology broken down into three steps. The problem statement (few-shot vulnerability, limitations of standard adversarial training) is clear, and the proposed solution (meta-learning universal adversarial prompt perturbations) is understandable. The expected outcome is quantified. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific meta-learning algorithm, the exact nature of the 'gradient-based' prompt generation (continuous vs. discrete handling), and the precise robust loss function, but the overall concept is well-articulated for a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial training and meta-learning are established fields, the specific combination of using meta-learning to generate *universal adversarial prompt perturbations* explicitly designed for enhancing *few-shot robustness* in large foundation models is innovative. It moves beyond instance-specific input perturbations common in traditional adversarial training and tackles the data scarcity issue inherent in few-shot adversarial defense by learning task-agnostic perturbation strategies. The focus on prompt robustness via meta-learned generators is a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current technologies. Meta-learning frameworks exist, foundation models are accessible, and gradient-based optimization is standard. Using unlabeled data is practical. However, challenges exist: 1) Effectively generating or perturbing discrete text prompts using gradient-based methods often requires approximations or specialized techniques. 2) Ensuring the 'universality' of meta-learned perturbations across truly diverse few-shot tasks and prompts might be difficult to achieve effectively. 3) The meta-learning phase itself, while aiming for few-shot application, might still require significant computational resources and diverse training tasks/data. Implementation requires careful engineering."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant and timely problem: the lack of robustness in few-shot learning settings for large foundation models, particularly against prompt manipulations. Improving robustness is critical for deploying these models safely and reliably in real-world applications (e.g., healthcare, legal). A successful implementation leading to the projected 15-20% accuracy improvement under attack would be a meaningful contribution to the field, directly impacting the trustworthiness and practical utility of few-shot learning techniques and contributing to the broader goals of Responsible AI."
