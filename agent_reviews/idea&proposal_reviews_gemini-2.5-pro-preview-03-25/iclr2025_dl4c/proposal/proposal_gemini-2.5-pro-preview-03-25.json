    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core concept of human-AI co-adaptation from the idea. It explicitly targets key themes from the DL4C workshop task description (Developer Productivity/HCI, Post-training/Alignment, Responsible AI). The introduction and methodology effectively synthesize the literature review, positioning the work against existing research (e.g., personalization, proactive assistants, HCI frameworks) and addressing the identified challenges (real-time adaptation, evaluation, privacy). All sections consistently build towards the central goal outlined in the research idea."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are specific and logically structured. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the planned work, including the conceptual framework, feedback mechanisms, algorithmic approaches (mentioning specific techniques like PEFT, LoRA, RLHF-like updates, meta-learning), implementation details, and a rigorous evaluation plan. The language is precise, and the structure is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities inherent in research proposals (e.g., exact hyperparameters, final loss formulations) do not detract from the overall clarity of the plan."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While personalization of code models and online learning are existing areas, the core concept of a 'human-AI co-adaptation loop' involving continuous, bidirectional adaptation based on rich, multi-modal, in-situ feedback (implicit and explicit) for code LLMs is innovative. The integration of online learning, meta-learning, and PEFT specifically for this real-time, user-driven adaptation in the coding context represents a fresh approach. It clearly distinguishes itself from static personalization or purely proactive systems identified in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in ML (online/meta-learning, PEFT, RLHF), HCI (feedback, adaptation, user studies), and SE (developer tools). The proposed methodology is robust, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques (PEFT for efficient personalization, established online learning principles) and outlining a rigorous empirical evaluation plan (controlled user study with relevant metrics, qualitative analysis). Technical formulations, while high-level, are conceptually correct. Potential challenges (e.g., feedback noise, adaptation stability) are implicitly acknowledged, and the inclusion of responsible AI considerations strengthens the soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Implementing the real-time adaptation component for large code LLMs using diverse feedback streams requires advanced ML expertise and careful engineering for efficiency and stability. Developing the IDE plugin and backend infrastructure is standard but non-trivial. The user study requires careful recruitment and execution. While PEFT methods reduce computational cost compared to full fine-tuning, resource requirements (compute for potential meta-learning and serving) could still be substantial. The plan acknowledges privacy concerns and suggests mitigation (local processing), adding complexity. The overall scope is ambitious, requiring careful project management, but achievable with appropriate resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current AI code assistants – the lack of dynamic personalization and adaptation – which is a major barrier to maximizing developer productivity and fostering effective human-AI collaboration. Success would lead to substantial advancements in AI-powered developer tools, contribute novel techniques for real-time model adaptation based on human feedback (relevant to ML and HCI), and provide valuable insights into designing responsible adaptive systems. The project directly aligns with key challenges highlighted in the DL4C workshop call, indicating high relevance and potential impact within the research community."
