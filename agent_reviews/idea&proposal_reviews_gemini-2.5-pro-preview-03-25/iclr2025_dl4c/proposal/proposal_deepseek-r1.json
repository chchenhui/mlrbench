    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key DL4C themes like 'Developer Productivity and HCI for Code' (adaptation to user needs), 'Post-training and Alignment for Code' (learning from human feedback), and 'Open Science and Responsible AI' (privacy-preserving methods, open-source commitment). The methodology and objectives perfectly elaborate on the core research idea of human-AI co-adaptation loops, multi-modal feedback, and meta-learning. It effectively builds upon the cited literature (e.g., MPCODER, CodingGenie, co-adaptation concepts from [6, 8]) and aims to tackle the identified challenges like personalization, real-time adaptation, and privacy."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific, the structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Evaluation, Outcomes, Impact), and the overall research plan is understandable. The methodology section details the key components like the IDE plugin, feedback types, privacy measures (DP, FL), and learning algorithms (MAML, EWC) with appropriate technical references and even equations. The evaluation plan is well-defined. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as a more concrete definition of the feedback alignment loss term 'd(.)' and how diverse feedback modalities are quantitatively integrated, but overall clarity is high for a proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like personalized code generation (MPCODER), proactive assistance (CodingGenie), meta-learning (MAML), and privacy techniques exist, the core novelty lies in their integration into a cohesive 'human-AI co-adaptation loop' framework specifically for code assistants. The emphasis on *continuous, bidirectional adaptation* driven by *multi-modal feedback* and enabled by *real-time meta-learning* distinguishes it from prior work. Applying the co-adaptation concept [6, 8] explicitly to personalize code LLMs in this manner is a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established LLM technology (CodeLlama), relevant learning paradigms (meta-learning via MAML, continual learning via EWC), and standard privacy techniques (DP, FL). The proposed methodology, including the feedback mechanisms and the structure of the loss function (combining task performance and feedback alignment), is logical and well-justified. The evaluation plan is robust, incorporating both controlled and longitudinal studies with appropriate metrics and baselines. Technical formulations (equations for DP, MAML, EWC) are correctly presented. The main challenge lies in the practical integration and optimization of these components, but the underlying approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant engineering challenges. Developing a sophisticated IDE plugin for multi-modal feedback collection, implementing privacy-preserving real-time meta-learning (MAML + EWC + FL/DP), and ensuring stability and efficiency requires substantial expertise and resources. Recruiting 80 developers for studies is achievable but requires effort. While the core technologies exist, their seamless integration into a performant, user-friendly system is complex. The 6-month field study timeline is ambitious for observing long-term adaptation effects fully. The project is feasible with a strong team and adequate resources, but carries moderate implementation risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current AI code assistants â€“ the lack of deep personalization and adaptation to individual developers. Success would represent a major step towards truly collaborative human-AI programming, potentially leading to substantial gains in developer productivity and satisfaction. The focus on co-adaptation, privacy-preserving personalization, and open-sourcing the framework/tools addresses key needs in the field. It directly contributes to multiple important themes within the DL4C workshop and the broader AI/HCI/SE communities."
