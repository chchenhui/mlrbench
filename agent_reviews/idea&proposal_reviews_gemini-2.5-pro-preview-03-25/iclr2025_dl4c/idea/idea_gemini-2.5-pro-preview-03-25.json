        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea aligns excellently with the task description (DL4C workshop CFP). It directly addresses the specifically welcomed topic 'Post-training and Alignment for Code', explicitly mentioning the use of 'execution feedback'. Furthermore, it incorporates 'Reinforcement Learning for Code' and touches upon 'Benchmarking and Evaluation for Code' by focusing on 'code efficiency'. The goal of improving performance beyond correctness fits well with the workshop's theme of 'Emergent Possibilities and Challenges'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (gap between correctness and performance alignment) is explicitly stated. The proposed method (RL fine-tuning using multi-objective execution feedback including performance metrics) is clearly articulated, including the reward mechanism concept. The expected outcome (correct and more performant code) is unambiguous. Minor details like the exact RL algorithm or specific metrics are left open but the core concept is perfectly understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While using execution feedback (pass/fail) for alignment is established, the core novelty lies in extending this feedback to include fine-grained performance metrics (CPU time, memory usage) and using these within an RL framework to explicitly optimize for code efficiency during generation, alongside correctness. This multi-objective alignment focusing on non-functional properties like performance represents a significant and innovative step beyond current correctness-centric alignment methods for code LLMs."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible as it builds upon existing techniques like LLM fine-tuning, RL (PPO), code compilation, and execution monitoring. However, practical implementation faces notable challenges: 1) Ensuring consistent and reliable execution environments for performance measurement at scale. 2) The computational cost of repeatedly executing code variants during RL training. 3) Designing a robust multi-objective reward function that effectively balances correctness and potentially conflicting performance metrics without destabilizing training. These challenges require significant engineering effort but seem surmountable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Generating functionally correct code is necessary but often insufficient; performance is critical in many software applications. Aligning models to produce efficient code directly addresses a major limitation of current code generation tools. Success in this area could lead to substantial improvements in developer productivity (reducing manual optimization effort) and the practical utility of AI-generated code, especially for performance-sensitive tasks. It tackles a critical aspect of real-world software development."
