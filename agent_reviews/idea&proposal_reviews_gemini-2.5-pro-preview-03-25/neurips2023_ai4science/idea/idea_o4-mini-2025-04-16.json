        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses two explicitly mentioned interests of the workshop: 'Scaling dynamical system modeling to millions of particles' and 'Incorporating physical insights to AI methods'. Furthermore, it aligns well with several example topics, including 'Learning physical dynamics from data', 'Speeding up physical simulators, samplers and solvers', 'Molecular modeling', and potentially 'Accelerating cosmological simulations'. The motivation rooted in materials science, plasma physics, and molecular biology fits squarely within the 'AI for Science' theme."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation, core methodology (GNO + symplectic integrators), training approach (physics-informed loss on smaller datasets), scaling strategy (kernel factorization, localized message passing), and expected outcomes (speedup, stability) are articulated concisely and logically. The relationship between the components is clear. It assumes some domain knowledge (GNOs, symplectic methods) appropriate for the target audience but explains the core concepts effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While GNOs, physics-informed learning, and symplectic integrators exist independently, their proposed integration specifically for *scalable* and *stable* particle dynamics simulation is innovative. Applying GNOs to learn continuous operators respecting symplectic structures (via loss or architecture) for generalization across particle numbers, combined with kernel factorization and adaptive time-stepping based on learned uncertainty, represents a fresh approach. It's not entirely groundbreaking (building on existing concepts) but offers a significant novel combination tailored to a challenging problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but presents moderate implementation challenges. GNOs are implementable, and symplectic methods are understood. Integrating symplectic constraints into neural networks is an active research area with existing approaches (e.g., HNNs). Training on smaller datasets generated by classical methods is standard. However, achieving robust scaling to *millions* of particles while maintaining accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency using kernel factorization and localized message passing will require significant research and engineering effort. Ensuring the learned operator truly preserves symplectic properties over long timescales at scale is non-trivial. Adaptive time-stepping adds further complexity."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Simulating large-scale particle systems accurately and efficiently is a fundamental bottleneck across numerous scientific fields (materials science, chemistry, biology, physics). Achieving a 10-100x speedup over classical methods while preserving long-term physical conservation laws (like energy) would be a transformative advancement. This could enable previously intractable simulations, accelerating scientific discovery significantly, particularly in areas like materials design and molecular dynamics. It directly addresses a grand challenge in computational science."
