        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses two key topics mentioned: 'incorporating physical insights to AI methods' and 'accelerating drug discovery pipeline'. It also fits well within the example topics of 'molecular modeling and de novo generation', 'learning physical dynamics from data', and potentially 'speeding up physical simulators' (via the surrogate model). The focus on using AI (RL) informed by physics (MD simulations) to solve a scientific challenge (drug discovery bottleneck) is precisely what the AI for Science Workshop aims to explore."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (physically implausible candidates), the core approach (RL agent interacting with MD simulator/surrogate), the key components (generator, MD feedback, reward mechanism), and the specific innovations (MD surrogate, adaptive reward balancing) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. It provides a strong conceptual understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While RL for molecular generation and physics-informed ML are existing areas, the specific integration of an RL agent directly interacting with MD simulations (or a dedicated surrogate) in the generation loop to optimize for physical stability and dynamics alongside chemical properties is innovative. The proposed use of a lightweight MD surrogate for rapid feedback within the RL loop and adaptive reward balancing are specific novel contributions aimed at tackling the computational challenges inherent in this approach. It offers a fresh perspective on improving de novo generation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core components (RL frameworks, graph NNs, MD simulators) exist. However, integrating them efficiently poses difficulties. Running full MD simulations within an RL loop is computationally prohibitive, making the accuracy and speed of the proposed 'lightweight MD surrogate' absolutely critical, yet developing such a surrogate that is both fast and reliable across diverse generated molecules is a major research challenge itself. Furthermore, RL training in complex, high-dimensional chemical spaces combined with potentially noisy or delayed rewards from physical simulations can be unstable and require careful tuning of the reward function (including the adaptive balancing mentioned). Significant effort and resources would be needed."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in drug discovery: the high failure rate of computationally generated candidates due to poor physical or pharmacokinetic properties often neglected in initial generation phases. Successfully generating molecules that are inherently more stable and physically plausible could drastically reduce the time and cost associated with the hit-to-lead optimization process. The potential impact extends beyond drug discovery to materials science and contributes fundamentally to building AI models grounded in physical reality, a key goal in AI for Science."
