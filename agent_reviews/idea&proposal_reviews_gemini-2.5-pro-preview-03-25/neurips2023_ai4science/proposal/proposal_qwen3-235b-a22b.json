        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (AI for Science, focusing on drug discovery, physical insights, structural biology), the research idea (Physics-Informed RL for De Novo Molecular Generation using MD feedback), and the literature review (building upon RL for molecules, PINNs, QM/MD integration, adaptive rewards). It clearly identifies the gap (lack of physical plausibility in generated molecules), references relevant prior work appropriately, and proposes a solution directly addressing the workshop themes and the core idea. The methodology directly tackles challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as computational cost (via surrogate) and reward design (via dynamic balancing)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The introduction sets the context effectively, the methodology outlines the key components (generator, surrogate, RL, reward) and implementation steps logically, and the expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated. The use of technical terms is appropriate. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise formulation of the PINN's physics loss term and the exact mechanism for the adaptive reward weight updates (gradient ascent meta-learning is mentioned but could be slightly more detailed). However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like RL for molecular generation, PINNs for MD, surrogate models, and adaptive rewards exist (as acknowledged and cited from the literature review), the specific combination and integration proposed here are innovative. The core novelty lies in the tight coupling of a generative RL agent with a *surrogate* MD model providing *real-time* physical feedback, guided by a *dynamically balanced* multi-objective reward function considering both chemical and physical properties. This interactive loop with a fast surrogate distinguishes it from methods using static constraints or computationally prohibitive full MD simulations within the loop."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established techniques (Graph Transformers, PPO, PINNs, MD principles). The methodology is generally well-defined, outlining a plausible approach. However, the soundness relies heavily on the successful creation and validation of the PINN surrogate model, which is a non-trivial task, especially for accurately predicting complex properties like binding free energy efficiently. The proposal acknowledges this by outlining a training process but the accuracy-speed trade-off is critical. The dynamic reward balancing mechanism also requires careful implementation to ensure stability. Technical formulations like the PPO objective are standard, but the specifics of the PINN physics loss and the meta-learning update rule are high-level."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial expertise across RL, GNNs, MD simulations, and PINNs, along with considerable computational resources for MD data generation and RL/PINN training. The core challenge lies in developing a surrogate MD model (PINN) that is both fast enough for real-time RL interaction and accurate enough to provide meaningful physical guidance. Training and validating such a surrogate is complex. Integrating all components and tuning the dynamic reward system adds further complexity. While the plan is logical, the successful execution faces notable technical hurdles and risks, making it ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in AI-driven drug discovery: the generation of physically implausible molecules, which leads to high attrition rates and wasted resources. Successfully integrating real-time physics-based validation could substantially accelerate the discovery pipeline. Furthermore, the work contributes to the broader field of AI for Science by advancing methods for incorporating physical insights and dynamic simulations into generative models, with potential applications beyond drug discovery (e.g., materials science). It directly aligns with the workshop's goals."
