        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's interest in 'Incorporating physical insights to AI methods' and 'Accelerating drug discovery pipeline'. The methodology precisely implements the core research idea of using a physics-informed RL framework with an MD surrogate. Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant RL methods for molecular generation and physics-informed approaches, and explicitly mentioning a baseline from the literature review (arXiv:2312.04567). The objectives and expected outcomes directly correspond to the motivation outlined in the research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, motivation, and research objectives are explicitly stated with quantifiable targets (e.g., ≥90% time reduction, 30–50% MD cycle reduction). The methodology is broken down logically into components (framework overview, MD surrogate, RL agent, full algorithm, experimental design) with clear mathematical formulations where appropriate. The structure is easy to follow, and the language is precise. Minor details, like the exact definition of stability/binding metrics or specifics of adaptive weight updates, could be elaborated, but their absence doesn't hinder understanding at the proposal stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While RL for molecular generation and physics-informed models exist (as shown in the literature review), the core novelty lies in the specific integration of a *learned GNN-based MD surrogate* providing *dynamic physical feedback* (stability, binding proxies) directly within the RL reward loop for *de novo* design. This contrasts with methods using static constraints (cited baseline arXiv:2312.04567) or potentially slower direct QM/MD calculations (Refs 6, 9). The adaptive balancing of chemical and surrogate-physical rewards is also a refined aspect. It's a novel combination of existing techniques tailored effectively to the problem, pushing beyond standard chemical property optimization."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established methods: policy gradient RL, GNNs for molecular property prediction, and the concept of surrogate modeling. The mathematical formulations for the reward, surrogate loss, and policy gradient appear correct. The experimental plan includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The main assumption impacting soundness is the ability of the GNN surrogate, trained on relatively short MD simulations (2-5 ns), to accurately predict complex physical properties relevant for the RL reward. While plausible, the fidelity of this surrogate is crucial and represents a core research challenge acknowledged implicitly by the plan to study the effect of MD simulation length. The overall approach is well-justified and theoretically grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation effort. The required technologies (GNNs, RL frameworks, MD simulators, cheminformatics libraries) are mature. However, generating the MD dataset (50,000 simulations) is computationally intensive and time-consuming, requiring substantial CPU resources. Training the GNN surrogate and the RL agent requires significant GPU resources (A100s mentioned). Expertise across ML, cheminformatics, and computational biophysics/chemistry is necessary. The primary risk factor is achieving sufficient accuracy with the MD surrogate model, especially given the reliance on short simulations. While the plan is realistic, the resource requirements and the dependency on surrogate performance make it challenging, warranting a 'Good' rather than 'Excellent' score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in drug discovery: the high attrition rate of computationally designed molecules due to poor physical properties. By aiming to generate molecules that are both chemically relevant and physically plausible (stable, good binding potential), it tackles a critical bottleneck. Success would lead to substantial impact by accelerating the hit-to-lead process, reducing wasted resources on non-viable candidates, and potentially improving the quality of leads. The framework's potential applicability to other areas (materials science, protein design) further enhances its significance. The expected outcomes (30-50% MD reduction, >25% increase in stable molecules) represent major advancements if achieved."
