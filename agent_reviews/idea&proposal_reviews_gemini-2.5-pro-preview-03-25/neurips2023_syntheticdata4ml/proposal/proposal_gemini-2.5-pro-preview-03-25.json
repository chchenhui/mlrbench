    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for synthetic data generation methods using Generative AI (specifically LLMs) that tackle data scarcity, privacy, and fairness simultaneously for tabular data. The problem statement, objectives, and methodology directly stem from the research idea and are well-contextualized within the provided literature, acknowledging recent work on DP LLMs and DP+Fairness using various models. It explicitly aims to fill the identified gap of combining DP and Fairness within an LLM framework for tabular data, including benchmarking."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, problem statement, and objectives are articulated precisely. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step description of the proposed framework (DP-Fair-TabLLM), including data representation, LLM choice, DP-SGD integration with correct formulation, fairness integration strategies (regularization, constrained decoding), and the combined training process. The experimental design is thorough, specifying datasets, baselines, comprehensive evaluation metrics across utility, privacy, and fairness, and planned ablation studies. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While leveraging existing concepts like LLMs, DP-SGD, and group fairness metrics, its novelty lies in the specific combination and integration of these elements into a unified framework (DP-Fair-TabLLM) explicitly designed for *simultaneously* achieving differential privacy and fairness in LLM-based *tabular* data synthesis. The literature review shows work on DP LLMs and DP+Fairness using other architectures (GANs, VAEs, Transformers), and some initial exploration in LLMs. This proposal focuses squarely on this intersection for LLMs, proposing specific integration strategies (fairness regularization, constrained decoding) within the DP fine-tuning loop and a systematic evaluation of the trade-offs. It's a timely and relevant contribution addressing a specific gap, even if not entirely groundbreaking in its individual components."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations: pre-trained LLMs, established Differential Privacy mechanisms (DP-SGD with RDP accounting), and standard group fairness definitions (DP, EO). The proposed methodology is robust, detailing standard practices for data serialization, leveraging state-of-the-art DP techniques, and outlining plausible strategies for fairness integration. The technical formulation for DP-SGD is correct. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines (drawn from the literature review), standard evaluation metrics for utility, privacy, and fairness (TSTR, JSD, DPD, EOD), and necessary ablation studies. The approach is well-justified and technically coherent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on publicly available pre-trained LLMs, standard datasets, and existing libraries for DP (Opacus, TF Privacy). Implementing DP-SGD fine-tuning for LLMs is challenging but achievable with current tools. Integrating the fairness constraints requires careful engineering but is conceptually viable. The computational resources needed for fine-tuning LLMs with DP-SGD are significant but standard for current ML research. The main challenges lie in the empirical tuning required to balance the utility-privacy-fairness trade-offs effectively and potentially implementing baselines if code is unavailable, but these are common research challenges. The scope is ambitious but manageable within a typical research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in trustworthy AI: the lack of methods to generate synthetic data that is simultaneously high-utility, privacy-preserving, and fair. This is crucial for enabling ML in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, as highlighted in the task description. Success would provide a valuable tool for data sharing, mitigating bias, addressing data scarcity, and advancing responsible AI practices. It also contributes to the field of controllable generative modeling by adapting powerful LLMs for complex, multi-objective structured data generation. The potential impact on both research and practice is substantial."
