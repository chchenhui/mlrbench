        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: synthetic data generation using Generative AI (diffusion models), focusing explicitly on the key challenges of Privacy (via DP) and Bias/Fairness (via fairness constraints). It targets tabular data in relevant high-stakes domains (healthcare, finance) and aims to provide a unified framework for trustworthy ML training, which is the central goal mentioned in the task description. It also acknowledges the need for evaluation across utility, privacy, and fairness metrics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation explicitly states the problem (lack of simultaneous privacy/fairness in synthetic data). The main idea clearly outlines the proposed model (conditional diffusion), the specific techniques employed (calibrated noise for DP, Lagrangian penalty for fairness), the target constraints (Îµ-DP, statistical parity/equalized odds), and the evaluation strategy. The goal of producing trustworthy, bias-aware synthetic data is unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models, DP, and fairness constraints exist individually, the proposed *joint* enforcement of DP and fairness *within* a conditional diffusion model specifically for *tabular* data synthesis is innovative. Integrating calibrated noise injection and fairness-driven gradient penalties directly into the reverse diffusion process represents a fresh approach compared to methods that might handle these aspects sequentially or use different generative model backbones. It tackles a specific gap identified in the task description regarding simultaneous consideration of these factors in generative models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Diffusion models for tabular data are less mature than for other modalities and require careful handling of mixed data types. Integrating and calibrating DP noise within the diffusion process is achievable but requires careful theoretical and empirical work. Similarly, incorporating Lagrangian fairness penalties into the training/sampling loop adds complexity to the optimization process. While the components are based on known techniques, their combination requires significant engineering effort and computational resources, potentially more than simpler generative models."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely challenges of data privacy and fairness in machine learning, particularly for sensitive tabular data common in healthcare and finance. Providing a method to generate synthetic data that is simultaneously private, fair, and high-fidelity would be a major contribution towards enabling trustworthy AI development and responsible data sharing in high-stakes domains, directly aligning with the workshop's aim to empower trustworthy ML training."
