    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for standardized, community-driven evaluation frameworks for generative AI's broader impacts, emphasizing breadth of participation. The methodology clearly operationalizes the research idea's three-phase approach (Co-Design, Toolkit, Repository/Policy). Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the lack of standardization, limited stakeholder involvement, and measurement validity, by proposing concrete solutions like co-design workshops, a mixed-methods toolkit, and validation procedures grounded in evaluation science."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and logically flow into the methodology. Each phase of the methodology (Co-Design, Toolkit, Repository) is broken down into specific, understandable steps with clear objectives. The inclusion of mathematical formulations for MCDA and Bias Amplification adds precision. The experimental validation plan is clearly outlined with specific metrics. While minor details like the exact nature of the 'ground truth' for impact coverage validation or the specific identity of reference '[1]' could be slightly more explicit, the overall proposal is exceptionally well-articulated and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing participatory methods (drawing from Mun et al., Parthasarathy et al.) with evaluation science and measurement theory (aligning with Solaiman et al., Chouldechova et al.) into a single, coherent framework (CoEval) specifically tailored for generative AI's societal impacts. While individual components (participatory workshops, evaluation toolkits) exist, the proposed integrated three-phase structure (co-design informing a standardized toolkit and living repository) and its application across multiple AI modalities (text, image, audio) represents a fresh and innovative approach to the problem. The emphasis on stakeholders co-designing the evaluation criteria themselves within a structured framework is a key novel element."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established methodologies like co-design workshops, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), mixed-methods research (surveys, focus groups), and pilot testing with control groups. The proposed metrics draw on existing work (e.g., bias amplification) and standard statistical measures (Fleiss' Îº). The plan for iterative refinement based on feedback enhances robustness. Minor weaknesses include the potential difficulty in establishing a reliable 'ground truth' for validating impact coverage and the need to ensure the adapted bias metric is appropriate across different contexts. The incomplete citation '[1]' is a minor oversight. Overall, the methodology is well-justified and technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. Implementing co-design workshops with diverse stakeholders across three distinct AI domains requires significant logistical effort and skilled facilitation. Developing a comprehensive open-source toolkit and maintaining a 'living repository' demands substantial technical resources and ongoing commitment. The validation phase involving pilot deployments and achieving high inter-rater reliability presents challenges. However, the proposed methods rely on existing technologies and established research practices. The phased approach allows for iterative development and risk management. With adequate funding and a dedicated team, the project is achievable, though complex."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses a critical and timely gap in AI governance: the lack of standardized, inclusive, and scientifically grounded methods for assessing the societal impacts of rapidly proliferating generative AI systems. By aiming to democratize impact assessments, integrate diverse stakeholder perspectives, and provide practical tools and policy templates, CoEval has the potential to substantially advance responsible AI development and deployment. Its success could lead to more equitable AI systems, inform regulatory efforts, and establish a new norm for transparency and accountability in the field, directly aligning with the goals outlined in the task description."
