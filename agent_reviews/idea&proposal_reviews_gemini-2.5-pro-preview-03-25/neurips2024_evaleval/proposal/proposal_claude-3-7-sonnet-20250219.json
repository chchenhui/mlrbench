    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for standardized evaluation practices for generative AI's broader impacts, emphasizing breadth of participation as a key focus. The CoEval framework aligns perfectly with the research idea, detailing the three phases (co-design, toolkit, repository/policy). It effectively synthesizes and builds upon the cited literature (PARTICIP-AI, Solaiman et al., Chouldechova et al., Parthasarathy et al.), explicitly aiming to tackle the identified challenges like lack of standardization, limited stakeholder involvement, and measurement validity. The objectives and methodology are directly derived from and consistent with the provided context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated precisely. The methodology is presented in a logical, phased structure (Co-Design, Toolkit, Knowledge Sharing) with detailed sub-steps, specific techniques (SAM, nominal group, card sorting, Delphi, mixed-methods), and validation plans. The experimental design for framework validation is also clearly outlined. The language is academic and precise, making the proposal easy to understand despite its technical nature. The structure facilitates comprehension of the complex research plan."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty through its integration and operationalization of existing concepts. While it builds upon prior work in participatory methods (Mun et al., Parthasarathy et al.), impact categorization (Solaiman et al.), and measurement theory (Chouldechova et al.), its primary innovation lies in synthesizing these elements into a single, comprehensive, standardized, and multi-stakeholder framework (CoEval) specifically designed for generative AI evaluation. The combination of structured co-design workshops to define context-specific metrics *within* a standardized framework, a modular mixed-methods toolkit, and a living repository represents a novel contribution to evaluation practice in this domain. It's not introducing a completely new paradigm but offers a significant and needed advancement over ad-hoc or less integrated approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in relevant literature and theories (participatory research, evaluation science, measurement theory). The methodology employs established techniques (SAM, nominal group, Delphi, mixed-methods analysis, FAIR principles) appropriately. The inclusion of specific measurement validation steps (content, construct, criterion, ecological validity) and a comparative experimental design strengthens its rigor. The technical formulations (formulas for prioritization, sampling, comparison; statistical model) are generally plausible, although specific details like weighting schemes or the exact specification of the mixed-effects model might require further refinement during implementation. Overall, the approach is methodologically robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges due to its ambitious scope. Developing and validating a comprehensive framework, toolkit, and repository across three AI domains, while coordinating diverse multi-stakeholder participation (workshops, surveys, interviews, focus groups) requires substantial time, funding, and expertise in multiple fields (AI, social science, HCI, policy). Recruiting and managing diverse stakeholders, ensuring methodological consistency across pilots, and maintaining a 'living' repository long-term are non-trivial tasks. While the plan is logically structured, its successful execution depends heavily on securing significant resources and managing complexity effectively. The proposal could benefit from acknowledging these challenges and outlining mitigation strategies or a more phased rollout."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the lack of standardized, inclusive, and rigorous methods for assessing the societal impacts of generative AI. As these technologies become more pervasive, developing robust evaluation frameworks is critical for responsible innovation and governance. CoEval has the potential for major impact by providing a practical, validated framework and toolkit, fostering more consistent and comparable assessments, democratizing the evaluation process by including diverse stakeholders, informing evidence-based policy, and ultimately contributing to the development of more beneficial and less harmful AI systems. The creation of an open-source repository further amplifies its potential impact."
