    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem identified in the task description: the lack of standardized, participatory evaluation frameworks for generative AI's broader impacts. The proposed CoEval framework perfectly matches the research idea, detailing the three phases (Co-Design Workshops, Mixed-Methods Toolkit, Living Repository). Furthermore, the proposal explicitly references and integrates findings from the provided literature, using them to motivate the need for standardization (Solaiman et al., Chouldechova et al.), broader participation (Mun et al., Parthasarathy et al.), and methodological rigor based on measurement science (Chouldechova et al.). It aims to produce outcomes directly relevant to the task, such as a standardized framework, policy recommendations, and resources to lower adoption barriers."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The research problem, objectives, significance, and methodology are presented in a logical and structured manner. The three-phase methodology is detailed with specific techniques (VSD, Threat Modeling, Card Sorting), toolkit components (surveys, focus groups, scenarios, computational metrics), and pilot study plans. The data analysis and framework validation strategies are also outlined. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as further detailing the practical implementation and validation of the proposed computational metrics (e.g., the bias amplification score B_{amp}) across different modalities, but overall the proposal is highly understandable and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like participatory methods (Mun et al., Parthasarathy et al.), evaluation science principles (Chouldechova et al.), and mixed-methods research exist, the novelty lies in their specific integration into the structured, multi-phase CoEval framework designed explicitly for evaluating the societal impacts of generative AI. It moves beyond general calls for participation or standards by proposing a concrete, operational methodology. The combination of co-design workshops for criteria definition, a modular mixed-methods toolkit, pilot testing across diverse domains (text, vision, audio), and the creation of a living repository represents a fresh and comprehensive approach to the problem, clearly distinct from prior work focusing on specific aspects like anticipation (Mun et al.) or general principles (Parthasarathy et al.)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established theoretical foundations, including evaluation science, participatory action research (PAR), and Value Sensitive Design. The mixed-methods approach is appropriate for capturing complex societal impacts. The methodology is detailed, outlining specific steps for stakeholder engagement, data collection (workshops, surveys, focus groups, metrics), analysis (thematic, statistical, triangulation), and iteration. A plan for validating the CoEval framework itself is included. The technical formulation example (B_{amp}) shows consideration for quantitative aspects. Minor weaknesses include the inherent challenges of PAR (managing diverse stakeholders, potential biases) and the difficulty of developing truly validated measurement instruments (especially novel scales and computational metrics directly linked to societal harm) within the project scope, but the overall approach is methodologically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some significant implementation challenges due to its ambitious scope. The plan requires substantial effort in recruiting and managing diverse stakeholders across three distinct domains, facilitating complex co-design workshops, developing and validating a comprehensive mixed-methods toolkit, executing three pilot studies, and building/maintaining a living repository, all within a proposed 24-month timeline. While relying on existing technologies, success hinges on securing stakeholder buy-in, effective project management, and potentially partnerships for accessing AI models. The timeline seems tight for the depth of validation and iteration described. The risks associated with stakeholder engagement and toolkit development are manageable but require careful planning and resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely gap in the AI field â€“ the need for standardized, rigorous, and inclusive methods to evaluate the broad societal consequences of generative AI, a central theme of the motivating NeurIPS workshop. By developing the CoEval framework, toolkit, and repository, the research has the potential to substantially improve the quality and relevance of AI impact assessments. It directly promotes the democratization of AI governance by empowering diverse stakeholders. Success would likely lead to major advancements in responsible AI development practices, influence community norms towards more holistic evaluation, and provide valuable evidence-based resources for policymakers and developers, thus having a potentially transformative impact."
