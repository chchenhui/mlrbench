    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for standardized, community-driven evaluation frameworks for generative AI's broader impacts, emphasizing broadened participation beyond ML experts. It faithfully translates the core research idea (CoEval framework) into a detailed plan. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature, aiming to synthesize participatory approaches (Mun et al., Parthasarathy et al.), standardization needs (Solaiman et al.), and measurement theory (Chouldechova et al.), while tackling the key challenges identified in the review (lack of standards, limited involvement, validity)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Outcomes, Conclusion). Research objectives are specific and measurable. The three-phase methodology is broken down into detailed, understandable steps. Key concepts like stakeholder mapping, co-design process (card sorting, Delphi), toolkit components (surveys, focus groups, simulations, metrics), and pilot study design are clearly articulated. Technical details and formulas (Cronbach's alpha, Cohen's kappa, ANOVA) are presented appropriately within the context. The rationale and significance are compellingly argued."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing streams of research in a novel way. While participatory methods, measurement theory, and impact assessment frameworks exist separately (as shown in the literature review), CoEval's novelty lies in synthesizing these into a single, coherent, multi-stakeholder framework specifically for generative AI. The emphasis on a structured co-design process leading to a modular, mixed-methods toolkit, coupled with a 'living' open-source repository for community evolution, represents a fresh and comprehensive approach distinct from prior work which focused on specific aspects (e.g., listing impacts, applying measurement theory, advocating participation)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is well-grounded in established theories and methodologies, including participatory design principles, social science measurement theory (explicitly referencing Chouldechova et al.), mixed-methods research, and standard statistical validation techniques (Cronbach's alpha, Cohen's kappa). The proposed methodology is robust, with detailed steps for co-design (Delphi), toolkit development (validation procedures), and pilot testing (comparative experimental design, appropriate statistical analyses like t-tests/ANOVA). Technical formulations are correctly presented and relevant. The plan to integrate measurement best practices throughout adds to its rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. The required methods and technologies (workshops, surveys, focus groups, standard computational metrics, GitHub) are available. Piloting on existing model types is practical. However, the project's success hinges on effectively recruiting, managing, and achieving consensus among diverse stakeholders across multiple workshops and refinement cycles, which can be challenging and resource-intensive. Developing and validating a comprehensive toolkit across three domains (text, vision, audio) and maintaining a living repository requires significant, sustained effort and expertise. While the plan is logical, the coordination complexity and reliance on stakeholder engagement introduce moderate implementation risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the lack of standardized, inclusive methods for evaluating the broad societal impacts of generative AI. Its potential impact is substantial. By creating a validated, participatory framework and open toolkit, CoEval could standardize evaluation practices, enhance their comprehensiveness by including diverse voices, foster a community of practice, and directly inform AI policy and governance. It aims to transform 'Broader Impact' assessments from a procedural step into a rigorous, meaningful practice, potentially leading to more responsible AI development and deployment."
