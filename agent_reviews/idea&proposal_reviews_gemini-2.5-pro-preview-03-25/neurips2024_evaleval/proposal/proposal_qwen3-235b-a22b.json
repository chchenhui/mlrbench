    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core goals: standardizing GenAI impact assessments, broadening participation beyond ML experts, developing policy recommendations, and creating a framework. It faithfully elaborates the CoEval idea presented. Furthermore, it explicitly builds upon the cited literature (PARTICIP-AI, Solaiman et al., Chouldechova et al., Parthasarathy et al.) and directly tackles the key challenges identified in the review, such as the lack of standards, limited stakeholder involvement, and measurement validity issues. The proposed framework integrates concepts from the reviewed papers into a coherent whole."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally very clear and well-structured, with distinct sections for introduction, methodology (broken down into logical phases), expected outcomes, and impact. Objectives are clearly stated. The methodology provides significant detail on the steps, techniques (card-sorting, AHP, surveys, focus groups, specific computational metrics), and validation plan. The inclusion of mathematical formulas adds precision, although some might require specific expertise to fully grasp instantly. Minor ambiguities might exist in the exact operationalization of integrating diverse stakeholder inputs via AHP or the specifics of the 'Living Repository' interface, but overall, the proposal is well-articulated and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While the concept of participatory AI evaluation exists (as acknowledged by citing PARTICIP-AI and Parthasarathy et al.), the proposal's novelty lies in its specific, structured, multi-phase framework (CoEval) that integrates co-design workshops, a mixed-methods toolkit, and a dynamic 'living repository'. The synthesis of specific techniques (e.g., AHP for criteria weighting, specific bias/fairness metrics, Bayesian updates for the repository) within a unified, operational framework aimed at standardization and reproducibility offers a notable contribution beyond existing conceptual work or more narrowly focused frameworks. It focuses on *operationalizing* participation across the evaluation lifecycle."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong methodological soundness and rigor. It grounds its approach in measurement theory (referencing Chouldechova et al.) and employs a well-justified mix of established qualitative (card-sorting, focus groups, thematic analysis) and quantitative (AHP, surveys with reliability checks, computational metrics like KL divergence for bias amplification) methods. The inclusion of specific formulas and validation metrics (IRR, convergent validity, stakeholder engagement index) enhances its technical depth. The plan for iterative refinement and the use of Bayesian hierarchical modeling for updating criteria weights show a commitment to adaptive rigor. The technical formulations presented appear correct and relevant."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is ambitious, presenting some feasibility challenges. Recruiting 30-50 diverse stakeholders per domain, especially from marginalized communities, requires significant logistical effort, resources, and established partnerships. Implementing methods like AHP effectively with potentially large and diverse groups can be complex and time-consuming. Developing and maintaining the 'Living Repository' as a dynamic, community-driven platform with features like Bayesian updates and Semantic Scholar integration demands substantial, ongoing technical and community management resources beyond a typical research project lifecycle. While the individual components are feasible, their integration and scale pose moderate risks to successful implementation within a standard project timeframe or budget without significant institutional support."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and urgent problem: the lack of standardized, inclusive, and comprehensive methods for evaluating the societal impacts of rapidly proliferating Generative AI. By aiming to create a reproducible, participatory framework and toolkit, CoEval has the potential to substantially improve the quality and relevance of AI impact assessments, foster greater accountability and trust, bridge the gap between technical development and societal values, and directly inform AI policy and governance. Its success could lead to major advancements in responsible AI practices, aligning well with the goals outlined in the task description and addressing critical gaps highlighted in the literature."
