    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CoEval idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the need for evaluating broader impacts of Generative AI, the lack of standard protocols, and the workshop's key focus on 'Breadth of Participation' by proposing a collaborative multi-stakeholder framework. It aims to develop a framework, share findings (via the repository), develop future directions (through co-design), address barriers (by providing tools/guidelines), and potentially inform policy recommendations, hitting nearly all the workshop's stated topics and goals."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with a defined motivation, a structured three-phase approach (Co-Design, Toolkit, Repository), and specific examples of methods (card-sorting, surveys, focus groups, computational metrics). The pilot plan and expected outcomes are also outlined. While the core concept is very clear, minor ambiguities exist, such as the specific nature of all 'lightweight computational metrics' or the exact operationalization of the co-design workshops, but these are reasonable for an initial idea description."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While participatory methods, evaluation frameworks, and impact assessments exist individually, CoEval's novelty lies in its specific synthesis: a structured, multi-stakeholder *co-design* process explicitly integrating evaluation science and participatory methods for assessing *generative AI's societal impact*. The emphasis on involving diverse stakeholders (developers, users, experts, policymakers) from the outset to shape the criteria and tools, coupled with the open repository goal, offers a fresh and integrated approach compared to purely expert-driven or technically focused evaluations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed framework appears largely feasible. Co-design workshops, developing mixed-methods toolkits (surveys, focus groups), and creating repositories are achievable activities. Using 'lightweight' computational metrics suggests an awareness of implementation constraints. Piloting across three domains adds complexity but is manageable. The main challenges would be logistical (recruiting and effectively managing diverse stakeholders) and potentially resource-intensive, but the core components rely on established methodologies and technologies."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the lack of standardized, inclusive, and comprehensive methods for assessing the broad societal impacts of generative AI. By promoting multi-stakeholder collaboration and providing practical tools/guidelines, CoEval has the potential to significantly advance responsible AI development and governance, foster greater accountability, and ensure that diverse perspectives shape our understanding and mitigation of AI risks. Its success could lead to major advancements in evaluation practices within the AI community."
