        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for creating frameworks for documenting and standardizing evaluation practices for generative AI's broader impacts, with a key focus on broadening participation beyond ML experts to include diverse stakeholders and communities. The proposed 'Multifaceted Stakeholder Triangulation Framework' directly addresses this by suggesting a structured approach involving technical developers, domain experts, and affected communities, aiming for standardized outputs. It hits key topics like developing community-built evaluations and creating a framework for standardization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem (lack of inclusive evaluation). The main idea concisely explains the proposed solution: a triangulation framework involving three specific stakeholder groups, its key components (tiered structure, deliberative process, documentation template), and the intended operationalization (workshops, surveys, tools). The goal of comprehensive, comparable, and longitudinal assessment is explicitly stated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality within the context of generative AI impact assessment. While stakeholder engagement and triangulation are known concepts in other fields, applying a structured, multi-stakeholder triangulation framework specifically for generative AI impact, involving developers, domain experts, *and* affected communities, is innovative. The emphasis on creating standardized metrics and documentation templates across these diverse groups to enable cross-system comparison and longitudinal tracking adds a significant layer of novelty compared to current, often ad-hoc or technically-focused, impact assessment practices in AI."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. While the proposed methods (workshops, surveys, documentation) are standard, coordinating three distinct stakeholder groups (especially 'affected communities') effectively requires significant logistical effort, resources, and expertise in participatory methods. Developing standardized metrics and assessment tools that are meaningful and acceptable across groups with varying expertise and perspectives will be complex. Ensuring genuine participation and managing power dynamics are also non-trivial hurdles. It requires substantial effort beyond typical technical evaluations."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the inadequacy of current methods for assessing the broad societal impacts of rapidly advancing generative AI. By promoting inclusivity and diverse perspectives, the framework could lead to more robust identification of potential harms and benefits, fostering more responsible AI development and deployment. Creating a standardized approach would enable better comparisons across systems and time, informing best practices, policy development, and resource allocation for mitigating negative impacts. It directly contributes to the crucial need for better evaluation science in AI."
