        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of developing best practices for measuring the broader impacts of Generative AI, particularly emphasizing the key focus on broadening participation beyond ML/AI experts to include diverse stakeholders ('multistakeholder impact assessment'). The proposal aims to create a framework ('ParticipatoryAI framework'), share a methodology, develop future directions ('next-generation AI impact assessments'), and generate policy guidelines, all of which are explicit topics mentioned in the task description. It perfectly matches the need for community-driven evaluations and frameworks for standardization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation clearly defines the problem (narrow GAI evaluations). The main idea outlines the core components of the 'ParticipatoryAI' framework: stakeholder engagement methods, the use of NLP/causal modeling for impact profiles, federated learning for scalability/privacy, and interpretable recommendations. The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise technical implementation details of integrating qualitative data with quantitative models and the specifics of the causal modeling, but the overall concept and goals are very understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While participatory methods exist, applying them within a structured, hybrid human-AI framework specifically for GAI broader impact assessment is innovative. The proposed combination of multistakeholder qualitative input, NLP/causal modeling for standardization, and federated learning for privacy-preserving, scalable risk detection represents a fresh approach compared to traditional technical evaluations or purely qualitative social science assessments. It moves beyond simply stating the need for broader participation by proposing a concrete technical and methodological framework to achieve it."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Organizing large-scale, meaningful multistakeholder participation (surveys, workshops) requires substantial logistical effort and expertise in participatory methods. The technical components are ambitious: accurately mapping diverse, potentially noisy qualitative stakeholder inputs to standardized 'impact profiles' using NLP and causal modeling is a complex research problem. Implementing federated learning across potentially non-technical stakeholders with heterogeneous data presents practical hurdles regarding infrastructure, coordination, and data quality. While conceptually sound, integrating all these components into a robust, scalable system requires considerable resources and overcoming significant technical and logistical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the lack of robust, inclusive methods for assessing the broad societal impacts of rapidly proliferating Generative AI. Developing standardized, yet participatory, evaluation frameworks is crucial for responsible AI development, deployment, and governance. If successful, the 'ParticipatoryAI' framework, open-source tools, and datasets could substantially advance the field, influence policy, mitigate harms, promote equity, and build trust in AI systems. It directly contributes to the workshop's goal of creating impactful evaluation practices."
