        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for developing frameworks for measuring broader impacts of Generative AI, with a key focus on broadening participation beyond ML/AI experts to include all stakeholders. The idea directly proposes creating such a framework through a co-design process involving multi-stakeholder participation (ethicists, educators, policymakers, affected communities, technical experts). It aims to create standardized evaluation practices and resources (toolkit), directly matching the workshop's goals of developing future directions, creating frameworks, and emphasizing community-driven evaluations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of current evaluations), the core proposal (co-designed framework), the methodology (co-design workshops, Delphi method, mixed-methods criteria), the intended participants (diverse stakeholders), the expected outputs (adaptable toolkit with specific components), and the validation plan (pilot studies). The objectives and expected impacts are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While participatory design and co-design exist, systematically applying these methodologies specifically to construct a standardized, multi-stakeholder evaluation *framework* for the *societal impacts of Generative AI* is innovative within the AI evaluation field. It moves beyond simply acknowledging the need for broader input to proposing a structured, reproducible process (co-design, Delphi) for integrating diverse perspectives into evaluation criteria and protocols. The focus on creating a publicly adaptable toolkit further enhances its novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Co-design workshops and Delphi studies are established methods, but successfully recruiting, engaging, and synthesizing input from a diverse range of stakeholders (especially marginalized communities and policymakers) requires significant logistical effort, time, resources, and expertise in facilitation and qualitative analysis. Accessing specific generative models and contexts for pilot validation is also necessary. While achievable, it demands careful planning and substantial resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized gap in AI development: the lack of robust, inclusive methods for evaluating the broad societal impacts of powerful technologies like Generative AI. Current technical metrics often overlook crucial ethical and social risks. Developing a standardized, co-designed framework could lead to more comprehensive risk assessment, mitigate evaluation biases, foster greater accountability among developers, and provide crucial evidence for policymakers, potentially leading to major advancements in responsible AI governance."
