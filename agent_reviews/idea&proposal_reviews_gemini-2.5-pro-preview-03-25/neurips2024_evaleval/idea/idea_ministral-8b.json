        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea (CCDEF) aligns excellently with the task description. The task calls for developing future directions for effective community-built evaluations, creating frameworks for documenting and standardizing evaluation practices, and broadening participation beyond ML/AI experts for assessing generative AI's broader impacts. The CCDEF directly proposes creating such a collaborative, community-driven framework involving diverse stakeholders, developing methodologies, fostering collaboration, and standardizing practices. It hits nearly all the key points mentioned in the workshop's focus and topics."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-stated, the main concept (CCDEF) is defined, and the proposed methodology is broken down into five logical, understandable steps (Stakeholder Mapping, Methodological Development, Community Collaboration, Pilot Studies, Documentation). The expected outcomes and potential impact are also clearly articulated, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While the need for broader impact assessments and community involvement in AI ethics is recognized, the proposal for a structured, multi-stage Collaborative Community-Driven Evaluation Framework (CCDEF) specifically tailored for generative AI, with explicit steps for stakeholder mapping, collaborative methodology development, and pilot testing, offers a fresh and integrated approach. It combines existing concepts (community engagement, impact assessment) in a novel, structured way to address a specific, pressing challenge highlighted by the task description."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges, making it satisfactory in this dimension. Successfully mapping, engaging, and coordinating a diverse range of stakeholders (AI experts, social scientists, ethicists, various sector representatives) requires significant logistical effort, time, and funding. Developing comprehensive and agreed-upon metrics across disciplines is complex. Running effective pilot studies depends on securing partnerships and real-world test cases. While achievable, the scale and multi-disciplinary nature make it resource-intensive and organizationally complex, preventing a higher score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. The task description explicitly highlights the lack of standardized methods for evaluating the broader impacts of generative AI and the need for community-driven approaches. This idea directly addresses this critical gap. A successful CCDEF could lead to more reliable, comprehensive, and unbiased assessments, informing better AI development, deployment, and policy decisions, thus having a major positive impact on the field and society."
