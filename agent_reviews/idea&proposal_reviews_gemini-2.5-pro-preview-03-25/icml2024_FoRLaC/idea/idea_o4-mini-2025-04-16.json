        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of bridging reinforcement learning and control theory. It tackles multiple relevant topics listed in the call for papers, including performance guarantees (stability, regret bounds), fundamental assumptions (nonlinear systems, stability), computational aspects (MPC), models (nonlinear control, MDPs implicitly), data acquisition/exploration (optimistic exploration), online learning, planning (MPC), and target applications (robotics, industrial automation). It explicitly aims to provide new perspectives by combining techniques from both fields (Lyapunov functions from control, optimistic exploration from RL) to achieve both safety and efficiency."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, highlighting the gap between RL exploration and control stability. The main components (GP model, learned Lyapunov function, constrained MPC with exploration bonus and stability constraint) are clearly outlined. The claimed theoretical contributions (regret bounds, stability) and experimental validation plan are also stated. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for enforcing the Lyapunov decrease condition during learning ('in expectation') and the exact formulation of the constrained MPC optimization. However, the overall concept and approach are readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like GPs for dynamics, Lyapunov functions for stability, optimistic exploration, and MPC are known, their specific integration is novel. Specifically, formulating a constrained MPC that explicitly maximizes an optimism-driven exploration bonus (tied to GP uncertainty) subject to stability constraints derived from a *learned* Lyapunov function, while aiming for simultaneous regret guarantees and input-to-state stability, represents a fresh approach. It moves beyond simply using Lyapunov functions for safety verification towards actively integrating them into the exploration objective within a theoretically grounded framework."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation and theoretical challenges. 1) Gaussian Processes scale poorly with data dimension and size. 2) Learning provably correct Lyapunov functions, especially using function approximators like neural networks and ensuring the decrease condition holds reliably (even 'in expectation'), is notoriously difficult. 3) Solving the constrained MPC problem at each step, potentially involving non-convex objectives (exploration bonus based on GP uncertainty) and constraints (from the learned Lyapunov function), can be computationally expensive, potentially hindering real-time application. 4) Proving the claimed regret bounds and stability guarantees simultaneously for this complex interplay of components (GP errors, learned V, MPC) is likely non-trivial and would require careful assumptions. While feasible for research exploration, practical deployment faces hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of designing autonomous agents that can learn quickly and efficiently in complex, nonlinear environments while guaranteeing safety and stability â€“ a major bottleneck for deploying RL in high-stakes, real-world applications like autonomous driving, robotics, and industrial control. Successfully developing such a framework would represent a major advancement, providing a principled method to balance exploration efficiency with rigorous stability guarantees. It directly contributes to the goals outlined in the workshop call by offering a concrete theoretical and algorithmic bridge between RL and control theory."
