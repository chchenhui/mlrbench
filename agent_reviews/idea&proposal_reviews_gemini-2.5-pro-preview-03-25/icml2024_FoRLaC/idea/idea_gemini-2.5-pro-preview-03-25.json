    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. It explicitly aims to bridge reinforcement learning (offline RL) and control theory (robust control principles) to address a key challenge (robustness). This directly matches the workshop's goal of reinforcing the connection between these fields. It touches upon several listed topics, including 'Performance measures and guarantees' (robustness), 'Offline vs. online' (offline RL), 'Models' (dynamics models, Q-functions), and potentially 'Computational aspects' (robust optimization algorithms)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is very clearly articulated. The motivation (robustness gap in offline RL), the core proposal (integrating control-theoretic uncertainty sets), the key steps (nominal model learning, uncertainty set estimation, robust optimization), and the goal (quantifiable robustness) are well-defined and easy to understand. Minor ambiguities might exist in the exact methods for uncertainty set estimation ('techniques inspired by...'), but the overall concept and approach are crystal clear."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While robust RL and offline RL are existing fields, the specific proposal to leverage control-theoretic uncertainty sets (derived using system identification or scenario optimization concepts) within a minimax optimization framework for *offline* RL policy learning offers a fresh perspective. This differs from common pessimistic offline RL approaches that often focus on uncertainty quantification based on out-of-distribution actions rather than structured model uncertainty sets derived from control theory principles. It represents a novel synthesis of ideas from both domains."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible within a research context. Learning nominal models/Q-functions offline is standard. Estimating uncertainty sets using system ID techniques is possible, though potentially complex and data-dependent. The main challenge lies in solving the resulting robust (minimax) optimization problem, especially for high-dimensional state/action spaces or complex policy classes (like deep neural networks). Robust dynamic programming or specialized policy gradient methods exist but can be computationally demanding. However, approximations or focusing on specific problem classes could make it tractable for research purposes. It requires expertise in both RL and robust control."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Lack of robustness due to distribution shift is a major bottleneck for deploying offline RL agents in real-world, safety-critical applications (e.g., industrial control, autonomous systems), which are areas where control theory traditionally excels. Providing a method to learn policies with quantifiable robustness guarantees directly addresses this critical limitation. Success in this direction could lead to major advancements in trustworthy RL and significantly broaden the applicability of offline RL."
