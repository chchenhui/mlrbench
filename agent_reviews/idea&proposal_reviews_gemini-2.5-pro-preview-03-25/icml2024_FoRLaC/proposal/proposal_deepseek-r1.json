    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (bridging RL and control theory, focusing on stability/robustness guarantees), the research idea (jointly training policies and Lyapunov functions via constrained optimization), and the literature review (building upon recent works like McCutcheon et al. 2025 and Chen et al. 2025). It directly addresses the workshop's call for contributions connecting both fields, focusing on performance guarantees, stability, nonlinear systems, and benchmarks. The methodology and objectives directly reflect the research idea and leverage insights from the cited literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology (including network architectures, stability constraint, optimization formulation, training pipeline), and validation plan are clearly articulated. The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of the penalty term l(s, a), the exact mechanism for ensuring 'global' stability via validation on held-out states, and the specific update rule for the Lagrange multiplier, but the overall concept and approach are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core idea of using Lyapunov functions for stable RL is well-explored in the recent literature cited within the proposal itself (e.g., SAC-CLF, other Lyapunov-based RL papers from 2023-2025). The novelty lies primarily in the specific approach of *joint optimization* using a constrained policy gradient formulation with a Lagrangian dual, potentially offering a more integrated or efficient method than prior work. It also synthesizes ideas like self-supervised data generation (McCutcheon et al.) for Lyapunov learning. However, it's more of an incremental advancement and synthesis of existing concepts rather than a groundbreaking new direction."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of Lyapunov stability theory and reinforcement learning (constrained policy optimization, actor-critic structures). The proposed Lyapunov decay condition and Lagrangian formulation are standard techniques. Using neural networks for approximation is common practice. However, guaranteeing *provable* stability for general nonlinear systems with NN function approximators is inherently challenging and often relies on strong assumptions or yields probabilistic guarantees. The proposal acknowledges the need for validation but could be more explicit about the potential limitations of the theoretical guarantees achievable."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard simulation environments (Gym, MuJoCo, PyBullet) and deep learning frameworks. The proposed methods (constrained policy gradients, Lagrangian methods, joint network training) are complex but within the realm of current ML research capabilities. Integrating components like self-supervised data generation is achievable. Key challenges, such as tuning the optimization process and ensuring the learned Lyapunov function is valid, are significant but represent research difficulties rather than fundamental infeasibility. The experimental plan is realistic."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of ensuring stability and safety in RL, which is a major barrier to deployment in high-stakes, safety-critical applications (autonomous systems, robotics, industrial control). Successfully developing a framework that integrates RL's adaptability with control theory's rigor, specifically through Lyapunov stability, would have a substantial impact, fostering trust and enabling new applications. It directly aligns with the goal of advancing the theoretical foundations and practical applicability of learning-based control systems."
