        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the workshop task: bridging RL and control theory by focusing on stability guarantees, robustness, theoretical analysis (sample complexity, near-optimality), and applications in safety-critical systems (robotics, industrial processes). The methodology faithfully implements the research idea of jointly learning policy and Lyapunov networks via constrained optimization. It effectively positions itself within the provided literature, acknowledging recent advancements while clearly stating its aim to address remaining challenges like providing end-to-end model-free theoretical guarantees for the joint learning process."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to related work, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section clearly outlines the mathematical formulation (MDP, objective, constraint, Lagrangian) and the proposed algorithmic steps (block-coordinate updates). The experimental design is detailed with specific benchmarks, baselines, metrics, and implementation parameters. The rationale for the approach is well-articulated, making the proposal easy to understand with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While the core idea of integrating Lyapunov functions into RL using constrained optimization is present in very recent literature (as acknowledged by the proposal itself, citing 2023-2025 papers), the specific contribution lies in the proposed combination: a *model-free* approach that *jointly* learns the policy and the Lyapunov function using a specific Lagrangian-based constrained RL algorithm (LCPO), coupled with the aim to provide *rigorous end-to-end theoretical guarantees* (feasibility, near-optimality, sample complexity) for this joint process. This focus on comprehensive theoretical analysis within a model-free joint learning framework distinguishes it sufficiently from prior work, offering more than just an incremental step."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates rigor. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations from control theory (Lyapunov stability) and RL (MDPs, policy optimization, constrained RL, Lagrangian methods). The proposed methodology, involving block-coordinate updates for the policy, Lyapunov function, and Lagrange multiplier, is a standard and appropriate technique for constrained optimization. The mathematical formulations appear correct. The planned theoretical analysis, aiming for feasibility and near-optimality bounds using variational analysis and generalization bounds, follows a standard, albeit challenging, path in RL theory. The assumptions listed for the theory (Lipschitz dynamics, universal approximators, sampling coverage) are common in the field, though strong."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The algorithmic implementation (training policy, critic, and Lyapunov networks) is achievable using standard deep RL frameworks and computational resources. The experimental plan is well-defined and uses standard benchmarks. However, the primary feasibility risk lies in delivering the promised rigorous theoretical guarantees (near-optimality, sample complexity) for the joint optimization of neural networks in a model-free setting, which is known to be highly challenging. The safe exploration strategy (pre-training, safe sets) is practical but may require careful tuning to balance safety and learning efficiency."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of formal stability and safety guarantees in RL, which hinders its adoption in critical real-world applications like autonomous driving and industrial control. By aiming to integrate Lyapunov stability directly into model-free RL policy learning and provide theoretical certificates, the research has the potential for major impact. Success would represent a substantial step towards trustworthy AI, enabling the deployment of adaptive learning systems in domains where reliability is paramount, directly aligning with the goals outlined in the task description."
