    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Reincarnating RL' by proposing a method to reuse prior computation in the form of learned skills. It specifically targets key workshop topics such as 'Developing methods for accelerating RL training depending on type or combination of prior computation available (Learned Skills)' and 'Challenges for dealing with suboptimality of prior computational work'. The motivation also aligns with the workshop's goal of democratizing RL by making prior computation more accessible and useful, even when imperfect."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main concept (hierarchical skill library with scaffolding), and the mechanism for handling varying skill quality (direct use, decomposition, exploration guide) are explained well. The concept of an automatic skill quality assessor is also introduced clearly. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details of the metadata (e.g., compatibility metrics), the decomposition process, and the exact workings of the quality assessor, but the overall proposal is understandable and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While skill libraries and reusing skills in RL are not entirely new concepts, the proposed 'scaffolding' mechanism specifically designed to handle varying levels of quality in prior skills is innovative. The combination of a hierarchical structure, metadata, automatic quality assessment, and adaptive reuse strategies (direct, decompose, explore) based on quality offers a fresh perspective on robustly leveraging prior computation, particularly addressing the challenge of suboptimality which is often overlooked or handled in simpler ways (e.g., basic fine-tuning)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building the hierarchical library and storing metadata is achievable. However, designing robust and generalizable compatibility metrics, an effective automatic skill quality assessor (without manual annotation), and algorithms for skill decomposition or adaptation for exploration guidance are complex research problems. The success heavily depends on defining these components effectively, which might require considerable effort, specific domain assumptions, or further algorithmic breakthroughs. It's feasible as a research direction but not straightforward to implement perfectly."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a critical bottleneck in Reincarnating RL and lifelong learning: how to effectively and robustly reuse prior knowledge when its quality or relevance is uncertain or suboptimal. If successful, this framework could significantly accelerate RL training across iterations, make better use of available computational resources, and contribute to democratizing RL research by allowing researchers to build upon potentially imperfect prior work. The focus on handling suboptimality is particularly important for practical applications."
