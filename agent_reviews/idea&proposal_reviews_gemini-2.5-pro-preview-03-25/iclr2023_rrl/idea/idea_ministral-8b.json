        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of the 'Reincarnating RL' workshop by focusing on reusing prior computation (specifically, learned policies) to overcome the limitations of 'tabula rasa' learning. It explicitly mentions motivations like reducing computational burden and democratizing RL, which are key goals stated in the workshop description. Furthermore, the idea touches upon specific topics listed in the call, such as developing methods using 'Learned policies' and creating 'Evaluation protocols, frameworks and standardized benchmarks'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly, outlining the motivation, main concept (incremental policy transfer via fine-tuning), methodology (fine-tuning, adaptive LR, evaluation metrics), expected outcomes, and potential impact. The core concept is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific mechanisms for adaptive learning rate scheduling and the precise nature of the proposed evaluation protocols, but the overall research direction is well-articulated and mostly unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The core technique, fine-tuning pre-trained policies, is a well-established concept in machine learning, including transfer learning within RL. Adaptive learning rate schedules are also standard practice. Therefore, the fundamental technical components lack significant novelty. However, the novelty lies more in the specific framing within the 'Reincarnating RL' paradigm, the focus on *incremental* transfer for continuous improvement, and the explicit goal of developing standardized evaluation protocols *for this specific setting*. It combines existing techniques for a purpose highlighted as emerging and important by the workshop, rather than introducing a fundamentally new algorithm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research is largely feasible. Fine-tuning RL policies is technically achievable using existing algorithms and frameworks. Implementing adaptive learning rate schedules is standard. Developing evaluation protocols requires careful design but is a practical task. The main requirements would be access to pre-trained policies and suitable target environments/tasks for transfer, along with standard RL computational resources. While optimizing the fine-tuning process might present challenges, the overall approach is practical and implementable with current technology and knowledge."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea addresses significant challenges in RL highlighted by the workshop description: the high computational cost of training from scratch, the need for methods that allow broader participation (democratization), and the practical requirement for continuous agent improvement in real-world scenarios. Developing effective and efficient methods for policy transfer, along with standardized evaluation metrics, could have a substantial impact by accelerating research, enabling work on larger problems with fewer resources, and facilitating progress in applied RL. It directly contributes to establishing 'Reincarnating RL' as a viable research direction."
