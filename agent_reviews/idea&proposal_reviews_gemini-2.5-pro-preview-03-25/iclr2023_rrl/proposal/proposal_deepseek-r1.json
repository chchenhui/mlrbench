    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of suboptimal prior computation in reincarnating RL, a key theme in the task description. The methodology (uncertainty-aware distillation) directly implements the research idea. It acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges (suboptimal data, uncertainty estimation) highlighted in the literature review and task description. The objectives and significance resonate strongly with the goals of democratizing RL and enabling iterative refinement mentioned in the task description."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology stages (uncertainty estimation, policy distillation), experimental setup, and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The use of equations helps define the core components. Minor ambiguity exists regarding the precise definition or derivation of the prior policy \\\\pi_{\\\\text{prior}} used in the distillation loss, especially when the prior is only an offline dataset (is it obtained via behavior cloning first?). However, the overall structure and main ideas are easily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While components like ensemble Q-learning for uncertainty and offline RL (CQL) are known, their specific combination to perform *retroactive correction* of suboptimal prior data via uncertainty-weighted distillation in the reincarnating RL context is innovative. It moves beyond simply reusing priors (like fine-tuning or residual learning) to actively identifying and mitigating the influence of unreliable parts of the prior computation. This specific mechanism for handling suboptimality is a fresh contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established techniques: ensemble methods for uncertainty, Double DQN, offline RL (CQL), and policy distillation via KL divergence. The core idea of down-weighting distillation updates based on uncertainty is theoretically plausible and intuitive. The technical formulations presented are correct. Minor points could be elaborated, such as the potential interplay between the CQL objective and the distillation term, and ensuring the uncertainty measure effectively captures the relevant suboptimality. The experimental design is standard and includes appropriate baselines and metrics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on existing and well-understood algorithms (Ensemble DQN, Offline RL like CQL). The required resources (simulators, compute for deep RL) are standard for the field. Generating synthetic suboptimal data is straightforward. The experimental plan is realistic. Potential challenges like hyperparameter tuning (\\lambda, \\beta) are common in RL research and do not represent fundamental feasibility issues. The expected computational overhead (1.2x standard offline RL) seems reasonable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the practical application and advancement of reincarnating RL: the safe and effective reuse of imperfect prior computational artifacts. Success would contribute directly to democratizing large-scale RL, enabling more efficient iterative agent development, and potentially improving robustness in real-world deployments where prior data/policies are often suboptimal. It tackles a core challenge identified by the community (as per the task description) and offers a principled approach."
