    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of Reincarnating RL, focusing on the critical challenge of suboptimal prior computation (datasets, policies) highlighted in the task description and research idea. The methodology (uncertainty-aware distillation) is a direct implementation of the research idea. It explicitly aims to democratize RL and create evaluation protocols, aligning with the workshop's goals. The proposal also acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as handling suboptimal data and uncertainty estimation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, motivation, and significance are clearly stated. The two-stage methodology (uncertainty estimation via Q-ensemble and uncertainty-weighted distillation) is explained with supporting equations. The experimental setup, including baselines and metrics, is well-defined. However, there is a minor ambiguity regarding the final optimization step: how the distillation loss integrates with the final policy optimization (e.g., offline RL like CQL vs. online fine-tuning like PPO/SAC) could be specified more precisely. Mentioning Figure 1 without providing it also slightly detracts from clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the components used (Q-ensembles for uncertainty, policy distillation, offline RL) are existing techniques, their specific combination and application to retroactively correct suboptimal prior data via uncertainty-weighted distillation in the Reincarnating RL context is novel. It offers a fresh approach compared to naive fine-tuning or standard offline RL on suboptimal data. The novelty lies in the targeted mechanism for mitigating error propagation from flawed priors during distillation, rather than inventing a fundamentally new RL algorithm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established methods like TD-learning, Q-ensembles for uncertainty estimation, and policy distillation. The core idea of down-weighting updates based on uncertainty derived from ensemble variance is theoretically plausible and commonly used in related areas (e.g., offline RL, model-based RL). The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Potential minor weaknesses include the assumption that ensemble variance perfectly captures suboptimality (it primarily captures disagreement/epistemic uncertainty) and the reliance on the quality of uncertainty estimates derived solely from the potentially biased prior dataset, but these are reasonable research questions to investigate rather than fundamental flaws."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. Generating the required suboptimal datasets for Atari and MuJoCo is standard practice. Implementing Q-ensembles, policy distillation, and common offline RL algorithms (or fine-tuning online algorithms) is feasible with existing libraries and computational resources typically available in ML research labs. The proposed evaluation metrics and experiments are standard. The computational overhead of ensembles is manageable for the proposed scale."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the practical application of Reincarnating RL: the prevalence and negative impact of suboptimal prior computation. Successfully developing a method for robust retroactive correction could significantly accelerate RL development, democratize access to large-scale RL by making prior work more reliably reusable, and improve the safety of deployed RL systems by mitigating risks from flawed priors. The research directly contributes to the goals outlined in the Reincarnating RL workshop task description."
