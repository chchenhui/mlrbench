    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Reincarnating RL' by focusing on reusing prior computation, specifically tackling the challenge of suboptimal prior data, which is explicitly mentioned as a key topic in the task description. The methodology proposed (uncertainty-aware distillation) directly implements the research idea. It also positions itself well within the context provided by the literature review, aiming to improve upon existing methods by explicitly handling suboptimality, a noted challenge."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, significance, and overall methodology are presented logically. The two main stages (Data Analysis and Policy Distillation) are well-defined. The use of ensemble Q-networks for uncertainty and the concept of a distillation loss are explained. Minor ambiguities exist, such as not specifying the exact offline RL algorithm to be used and slightly imprecise notation for Q-hat in the loss function (though its meaning can be inferred from context). Overall, the proposal is easy to understand and follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using ensembles for uncertainty estimation and offline RL are established techniques, the specific combination proposed – using ensemble uncertainty on prior computation artifacts (policies/data) to explicitly guide a distillation process within an offline RL framework for *retroactive correction* in reincarnating RL – offers a fresh perspective. It distinguishes itself from standard fine-tuning or applying generic offline RL by actively identifying and downweighting unreliable parts of the prior data based on uncertainty. The novelty lies in this specific mechanism tailored for correcting suboptimal priors in the reincarnating RL context."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has areas needing stronger justification. Using ensembles for uncertainty is plausible, as is employing offline RL. However, the specific formulation of the distillation loss lacks theoretical grounding within the proposal. While intuitively sensible (downweight high uncertainty, trust low uncertainty), there's no justification provided for this specific linear weighting scheme or analysis of its potential convergence properties or failure modes. The assumption that ensemble variance directly corresponds to the 'suboptimality' that needs correction requires empirical validation. Furthermore, the choice of the underlying offline RL algorithm, crucial for stability and performance, is not specified, leaving a gap in the methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core components rely on well-understood techniques: training network ensembles and implementing offline RL algorithms. Standard libraries and computational resources typically available in ML research labs should suffice for the proposed experiments on Atari and continuous control tasks. Injecting synthetic suboptimality is a practical way to control experimental conditions. Potential challenges include hyperparameter tuning (especially lambda in the loss) and ensuring the stability of the offline RL process with the custom loss, but these are common research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem within the growing area of reincarnating RL. Effectively handling suboptimal prior computation is crucial for making reincarnating RL practical and reliable, potentially lowering the barrier to entry for complex RL tasks (democratization) and improving iterative development cycles in real-world applications. If successful, the proposed framework would offer a valuable tool for leveraging imperfect prior work, representing a meaningful contribution to the field and aligning well with the goals outlined in the task description."
