        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of reincarnating RL, focusing specifically on the critical challenge of suboptimal prior computation highlighted in the task description and research idea. The methodology builds logically upon the provided idea (uncertainty estimation, selective distillation) and references relevant work (Agarwal et al., Silver et al.) mentioned or implied by the literature review. It tackles key challenges identified (suboptimality, uncertainty, exploration) and proposes evaluation protocols, fitting perfectly within the scope defined by the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, problem formulation, and overall methodology (RPC-SDD) are presented logically. The breakdown into uncertainty estimation, confidence-weighted distillation, and uncertainty-guided exploration is easy to follow. The algorithm summary and experimental design are well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise form of the dynamics uncertainty distance metric or the normalization function for uncertainty, but these do not significantly hinder understanding of the core concepts. The structure is logical and facilitates comprehension."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it utilizes existing components like ensemble-based uncertainty estimation, policy distillation, and offline RL (CQL), its novelty lies in the specific integration of these elements into a framework (RPC-SDD) explicitly designed to *retroactively correct* suboptimal prior computation in reincarnating RL. The core idea of using uncertainty estimates derived from the prior computation itself to *weight* the distillation process, thereby selectively trusting the prior, is a fresh perspective compared to naive fine-tuning, standard distillation, or residual learning. It directly addresses the suboptimality gap mentioned in the literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established RL concepts (MDPs, Q-learning, ensembles, distillation, CQL). The use of ensembles for uncertainty quantification is standard practice. The confidence-weighted distillation loss is mathematically defined and intuitively appealing for down-weighting unreliable prior information. The integration of CQL addresses potential issues with offline data. Technical formulations are clearly presented and appear correct. While the specific combination of uncertainty terms and some hyperparameters are heuristic (requiring empirical validation), the overall methodological approach is logical and theoretically grounded in existing RL principles."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current RL techniques and computational resources. Training ensembles and implementing distillation losses are standard practices. The experimental plan uses common benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo). However, the method involves multiple complex components (ensembles for Q-values, ensembles for dynamics, CQL, distillation loss, exploration strategy) that need careful implementation, integration, and tuning. The computational cost associated with training multiple ensembles (2K networks) could be significant, and hyperparameter tuning (alpha, beta, lambda, eta, rho) might be challenging, introducing moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the practical application and advancement of reincarnating RL: the handling of imperfect or suboptimal prior computation. Successfully developing robust methods for this problem would significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of RL systems, lower the barrier for researchers with limited resources (democratization), facilitate iterative development and collaboration, and make RL more applicable to real-world problems where priors are rarely perfect. The potential impact on the field is substantial."
