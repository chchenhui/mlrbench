        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes, such as the limitations of single metrics, the need for holistic and contextualized benchmarking, comprehensive documentation, and establishing best practices. The proposal faithfully translates the research idea into a structured plan, detailing the concept of 'Benchmark Cards'. It effectively synthesizes and builds upon the cited literature (Model Cards, HELM, HEM) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified therein, such as the overemphasis on single metrics and lack of standardized documentation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The introduction effectively sets the stage, the research objectives are distinct, and the overall structure is logical. The concept of Benchmark Cards is explained well by analogy to Model Cards. However, the methodology section, particularly regarding the 'Model Evaluation' and 'Impact Assessment' phases, could benefit from more specific details. For instance, how the comparison between traditional benchmarking and the Benchmark Card approach will be operationalized, which specific benchmarks/models will be used for initial population/testing, and how 'suitability' or 'impact' will be quantitatively measured are not fully elaborated. Despite these minor points needing refinement, the core proposal is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by adapting the 'Card' documentation concept specifically for ML *benchmarks*, rather than just models or datasets. While inspired by Model Cards and informed by holistic evaluation frameworks like HELM, the specific focus on structuring information around the benchmark itself (its context, dataset nuances relevant to its use as a benchmark, recommended holistic metrics *for the benchmark*, limitations *of the benchmark*) represents a novel contribution to evaluation practices. It's not merely applying an existing idea but tailoring and extending it to address a specific gap in the ML ecosystem. It synthesizes existing ideas in a new and valuable way."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous. It is well-grounded in the acknowledged limitations of current benchmarking practices, supported by the provided literature and the workshop's premise. The methodological approach (literature review, template design, population, evaluation) is logical. However, the soundness could be improved with a more detailed and rigorous plan for evaluating the *impact* of the Benchmark Cards (Objective 5, Methodology steps 4 & 5). Specifically, defining objective metrics to compare model 'suitability' with and without the cards presents a challenge. Furthermore, the process for selecting and justifying the 'recommended suite of holistic evaluation metrics' for diverse benchmarks needs careful consideration to ensure robustness and avoid introducing new biases or arbitrary choices. The conceptual foundation is strong, but the evaluation aspect requires further methodological detail."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Developing a template and populating it for a selection of popular benchmarks using existing literature and benchmark information is practical. Evaluating models using standard holistic metrics (fairness, robustness, etc.) is technically possible, although assembling comprehensive suites requires effort. The main challenges lie in achieving consensus on the template structure and the recommended metrics, and in rigorously executing the impact assessment, particularly the comparative evaluation and community feedback collection at scale. However, conducting initial case studies and gathering targeted feedback is well within the realm of a typical research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses a critical and widely recognized problem in the ML community: the inadequacy of current benchmarking practices that often rely on single metrics and lack context. By promoting standardized documentation and holistic evaluation for benchmarks, the work has the potential to foster more responsible AI development, enhance transparency, improve the selection of models for real-world applications, and shift the community towards more meaningful evaluation practices. Its alignment with the goals of responsible AI and improving research methodology gives it substantial potential impact."
