    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on 'Comprehensive data documentation', 'Holistic and contextualized benchmarking', 'Benchmarking and leaderboard ranking techniques', and addressing the 'overemphasis on single metrics rather than holistic model evaluation' and the '(mis)use of datasets out-of-context'. The 'Benchmark Cards' proposal directly targets these specific issues by suggesting a standardized documentation framework for benchmarks that emphasizes context, holistic metrics, and limitations, aiming to shift focus away from single-score leaderboards."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (problems with current benchmarks), the proposed solution ('Benchmark Cards'), the analogy to 'Model Cards', the key components of the cards (context, dataset characteristics, holistic metrics, limitations), and the intended outcome (shift to multi-faceted, context-aware assessment). The plan to develop a template and populate initial cards is also mentioned, making the proposal immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While inspired by existing concepts like 'Model Cards' and 'Datasheets for Datasets', applying a similar structured documentation framework specifically to *benchmarks* themselves, with an emphasis on evaluation context, holistic metrics beyond the primary one, and known limitations, represents a novel contribution to benchmarking methodology. It's not a completely new paradigm but offers a fresh, structured approach to address known shortcomings in benchmark usage and interpretation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The core research idea – developing the 'Benchmark Card' template and populating initial examples for popular benchmarks – is highly feasible with current knowledge and resources. The technical steps are straightforward. The primary challenge lies not in the creation of the cards but in achieving widespread adoption by the ML community (benchmark creators, platforms like Hugging Face/PapersWithCode, researchers). However, the proposal itself is practical and implementable as a research contribution demonstrating the concept's value."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses critical and widely acknowledged problems in the ML ecosystem: the limitations of single-metric leaderboards, the lack of contextual understanding in model evaluation, and the potential for benchmark misuse. If adopted, 'Benchmark Cards' could fundamentally improve the transparency, trustworthiness, and utility of ML benchmarks, leading to more responsible model development, better model selection for real-world applications, and a healthier research culture around evaluation."
