    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses several key issues mentioned, such as the 'overemphasis on single metrics rather than holistic model evaluation', 'ethical issues in datasets', 'overuse of the same few benchmark datasets', and the need for a 'culture shift surrounding data and benchmarking'. The proposed framework fits squarely within topics like 'Data repository design and challenges', 'Comprehensive data documentation', 'Holistic and contextualized benchmarking', and 'Benchmarking and leaderboard ranking techniques'. It proposes a concrete technique aimed at establishing best practices within repositories like HuggingFace and UCI, which are explicitly mentioned as participants in the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is clearly articulated. The motivation is well-explained, outlining the problem with current practices. The main idea of a multi-dimensional 'Dataset Impact Score' is well-defined, including the specific dimensions (statistical quality, documentation, ethics, domain representation, usage diversity). The proposed implementation mechanism (quantifiable metrics, visual indicators, user feedback) and the overall goal are also clear. Minor ambiguity exists regarding the precise definition and calculation of the 'quantifiable metrics' for each dimension, especially subjective ones like 'ethical considerations', but this level of detail is often elaborated upon in the full research rather than the initial idea."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While concepts like dataset documentation (e.g., Datasheets for Datasets), ethical AI checklists, and critiques of benchmark overuse exist, this proposal synthesizes these into a standardized, multi-dimensional scoring framework *integrated directly into ML repositories*. The combination of specific dimensions (including usage diversity), the emphasis on standardization across repositories, and the inclusion of a dynamic user feedback loop for score evolution offers a fresh perspective on addressing dataset evaluation challenges at the infrastructure level. It's innovative in its holistic approach and proposed implementation within the repository ecosystem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Defining universally agreed-upon, quantifiable metrics for dimensions like 'ethical considerations' and 'domain representation' is inherently difficult and potentially contentious. Achieving standardization across different repositories (HuggingFace, UCI, etc.) requires substantial coordination and buy-in. Integrating such a system into existing repository infrastructure demands considerable engineering effort. The dynamic user feedback mechanism adds complexity regarding validation and integration into the scores. While technically possible, the social and technical coordination required makes implementation challenging, though not impossible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and widely acknowledged problems in the ML data ecosystem: the limitations of narrow metrics, the neglect of ethical considerations, and the negative consequences of benchmark monoculture. If successfully implemented and adopted, this framework could fundamentally change how researchers perceive, select, and use datasets, fostering more responsible, ethical, and diverse ML research. It has the potential to directly influence major platforms and shift community norms, leading to substantial positive advancements in the field."
