        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the intersection of Machine Learning and Global Health, focusing on a difficult public health problem (disease surveillance). It tackles key limitations identified in the task description, such as data scarcity, heterogeneity, and privacy concerns, which are particularly relevant in global health and resource-limited settings. The proposed solution (Federated Learning + Domain Adaptation) is a relevant ML method aimed at improving pandemic preparedness, explicitly mentioned as a goal in the workshop call. It fits perfectly within the themes of leveraging ML for public health, addressing limitations, and potentially discussing data practices (by proposing a privacy-preserving alternative to centralized data sharing)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (data challenges in global health surveillance). The main idea (FL + UDA) is stated concisely. The mechanism, involving local training and UDA during aggregation (mentioning specific techniques like GRL and moment matching), is explained well. The objective (robust, generalized, privacy-preserving model) is unambiguous. The language is precise, making the proposal immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While Federated Learning and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation are established fields, their combination (Federated Domain Adaptation - FDA) applied specifically to robust disease surveillance across diverse, resource-limited settings with heterogeneous data (clinical, syndromic) offers notable novelty. The innovation lies not in inventing the core techniques but in tailoring and applying their synthesis to address the specific, complex challenges of global health surveillance, particularly the focus on robustness against domain shift inherent in decentralized, varied data sources."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible from a technical standpoint using existing FL frameworks and UDA algorithms. However, practical implementation faces challenges. Success depends on securing collaboration from multiple health institutions, potentially in resource-limited settings, which involves logistical hurdles. Ensuring sufficient computational resources (even if minimal) and reliable connectivity for FL communication across sites can be difficult. Standardizing data inputs and model architectures across diverse participants requires significant coordination. Evaluating the model's real-world effectiveness across genuinely heterogeneous settings also presents practical difficulties. While technically sound, the operational aspects require careful planning and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical need for effective, privacy-preserving disease surveillance, particularly in resource-limited regions often most vulnerable to outbreaks. By tackling data scarcity and heterogeneity, it could lead to more robust and equitable global health monitoring systems. Success would represent a major advancement in applying ML to pandemic preparedness and response, offering a scalable model for collaborative health data analysis without compromising privacy. The potential impact on public health policy and resource allocation is substantial."
