        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key topics mentioned in the task description, such as 'Federated in-context learning' and 'Prompt tuning and design in federated settings'. The methodology clearly follows the research idea of federated prompt distillation (FICPD). Furthermore, it positions itself well within the provided literature, acknowledging recent work on federated prompt tuning and PEFT while proposing a specific approach (FICPD) to tackle identified challenges like privacy, communication overhead, and heterogeneity."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, significance, evaluation metrics, and experimental design are clearly stated. The overall FICPD framework is presented logically in three stages. However, certain aspects lack sufficient detail for full clarity. Specifically, the server-side prompt distillation using meta-learning needs more elaboration – the provided loss function seems more like regularized clustering, and the exact meta-learning process for creating a 'universal prompt library' isn't fully explained. Similarly, the client-side integration step could be more precise about how the library 'Q' is used. The application point of differential privacy is mentioned but not detailed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While federated learning and prompt tuning are established fields (as shown in the literature review), the specific combination proposed in FICPD – focusing on *in-context* soft prompts, using server-side clustering of prompt embeddings, and employing meta-learning for *prompt distillation* into a universal library – appears distinct from the cited works. Many papers focus on PEFT in general, black-box settings, or logit distillation. The idea of distilling prompts themselves via meta-learning in a federated setting offers a fresh perspective."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, relying on established concepts like FL, prompt tuning, clustering, and differential privacy. However, there are weaknesses in the rigor and justification of the core methodological contribution. The mathematical formulation for the server-side meta-learning distillation is unclear and potentially questionable as a standard meta-learning objective; it requires better explanation and justification. The mechanism for client-side integration of the distilled library 'Q' is ambiguous. The integration of differential privacy is mentioned superficially without details on the mechanism or analysis. While the overall direction is sound, these specific technical aspects lack sufficient rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Local prompt tuning is parameter-efficient and suitable for FL. Transmitting prompt vectors is communication-efficient compared to full models. Server-side clustering is standard. The meta-learning distillation, while needing clarification, likely involves computations manageable for a central server. Implementing differential privacy is standard practice, although tuning the trade-offs requires care. The proposed evaluation uses standard benchmarks and metrics. Scaling to hundreds of clients is ambitious but plausible for prompt-based FL methods. The main uncertainty lies in the effectiveness of the proposed distillation technique, but implementation seems achievable with current technologies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses critical and timely challenges at the intersection of foundation models and federated learning, namely privacy-preserving adaptation, communication efficiency, scalability, and handling data heterogeneity, as highlighted in the task description. Enabling collaborative refinement of in-context prompts without sharing raw data could have a substantial impact, particularly for deploying FMs in sensitive domains or on resource-constrained devices. Success would represent a meaningful contribution to making FMs more practical and accessible in distributed settings."
