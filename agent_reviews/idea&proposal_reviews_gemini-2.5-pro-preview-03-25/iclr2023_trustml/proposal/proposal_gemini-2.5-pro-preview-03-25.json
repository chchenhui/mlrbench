    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem outlined in the task description: understanding and mitigating the impact of computational limitations on ML trustworthiness (specifically fairness and robustness). The objectives and methodology perfectly elaborate on the research idea, detailing the plan to quantify trade-offs, develop adaptive algorithms (ATATS), conduct theoretical analysis, and perform validation. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning its contribution clearly by aiming to simultaneously address multiple constraints and trustworthiness dimensions, which is identified as a gap."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure, starting with a well-motivated introduction, clearly defined research objectives, a detailed methodology broken down into phases, and concluding with expected outcomes and impact. The methodology provides specifics on datasets, metrics (including formulas), experimental design, and the core ideas behind the proposed adaptive algorithm (ATATS). Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise implementation details of the RL-based scheduler or the specific theoretical tools for Phase 3, but these are acceptable at the proposal stage and do not significantly impede understanding. The overall presentation is professional and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the concepts of fairness-utility or efficiency-fairness trade-offs and adaptive training methods exist (as acknowledged and cited), the proposal's novelty lies in its integrated approach. Specifically, it aims to: 1) Systematically quantify the impact of *various* computational constraints on *multiple* trustworthiness dimensions (fairness *and* robustness) simultaneously. 2) Develop a novel adaptive framework (ATATS) designed to dynamically balance these multiple objectives during training under resource constraints, potentially using RL. 3) Complement the empirical work and algorithm development with theoretical analysis of these multi-dimensional trade-offs. This combination and the specific design of ATATS offer a fresh perspective that extends beyond the scope of individual prior works cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established ML concepts and techniques for efficiency (pruning, quantization), fairness (standard metrics, mitigation techniques), and robustness (adversarial attacks, corruption benchmarks). The methodology is well-defined: Phase 1 employs a rigorous factorial experimental design; Phase 2 outlines a plausible adaptive algorithm (ATATS) with clear components (state, action, policy) and a relevant mathematical formulation; Phase 3 proposes relevant theoretical questions; Phase 4 includes a comprehensive validation plan with appropriate baselines and metrics. The technical formulations provided (fairness metrics, optimization objective) are mostly correct (minor typo in EOD acronym noted, but formula is standard). The ambition, particularly for the RL implementation and theoretical analysis, introduces complexity but the overall approach is methodologically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The empirical quantification (Phase 1) and validation (Phase 4) require significant computational resources and careful engineering but use standard techniques and datasets (though access to MIMIC-IV needs handling). The main challenges lie in Phase 2 (ATATS development), particularly if pursuing the RL approach which can be complex to design, train, and tune effectively for this multi-objective constrained problem, and Phase 3 (Theoretical Analysis), which is ambitious and may require deep theoretical expertise and potentially strong simplifying assumptions to yield results. While the overall plan is realistic, the complexity of ATATS and the theoretical goals introduce manageable risks and require substantial effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and practical challenge in deploying ML systems: the tension between computational efficiency and trustworthiness (fairness, robustness). This is crucial for responsible AI adoption, especially in resource-constrained environments (democratizing AI) and safety-critical applications (healthcare, autonomous systems). Successfully achieving the objectives would provide valuable scientific insights into fundamental trade-offs, practical tools (ATATS algorithm) and guidelines for practitioners, and contribute to societal goals of promoting more equitable and reliable AI. The research directly tackles key issues highlighted in the workshop call and has strong potential for broad impact."
