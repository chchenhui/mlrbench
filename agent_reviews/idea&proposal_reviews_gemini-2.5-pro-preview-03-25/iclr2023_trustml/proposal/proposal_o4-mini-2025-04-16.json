    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem outlined in the task description: the impact of computational limitations on ML trustworthiness (specifically fairness and robustness). It systematically expands on the research idea, providing concrete methodological details. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and cites relevant papers from the literature review (e.g., Doe & Smith 2023, Brown & White 2024, Johnson & Lee 2024, Blue & Red 2025, Binkyte et al. 2025), positioning the work as a unifying advancement that addresses identified gaps like the need for a combined theoretical and practical framework for multiple trust metrics under resource constraints."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction effectively sets the background, motivation, and objectives. The methodology section is logically structured into problem formulation, theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and experimental validation. Mathematical notations are introduced, and the core algorithmic ideas (causal scheduler, dynamic lambda updates) are explained conceptually, supplemented by pseudo-code (Algorithm 1). The experimental plan is detailed and unambiguous. While minor details about the SCM implementation or the precise link between theory and scheduler could be elaborated further, the overall proposal is immediately understandable and leaves little room for misinterpretation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. Its primary novelty lies in proposing a unified framework that simultaneously addresses theoretical lower bounds, practical adaptive algorithms, and multiple trustworthiness dimensions (fairness, robustness) under computational constraints. Specifically, deriving compute-trustworthiness lower bounds based on information theory and complexity appears novel in this combined context. The use of a causal structural model (SCM) to inform the adaptive scheduling of resources for fairness/robustness interventions, inspired by recent work (Binkyte et al. 2025), represents a cutting-edge approach distinct from prior heuristic or static methods mentioned in the literature review. The combination of these theoretical and algorithmic elements is groundbreaking."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (information theory, optimization, causality) and cites relevant prior work. The problem formulation is standard and well-defined. The proposed theoretical direction (Theorem 1 sketch) is plausible, adapting established techniques. The experimental design is comprehensive and rigorous, including relevant baselines, metrics, ablations, and statistical testing. Minor weaknesses include: 1) The potential oversimplification of using a *linear* SCM for complex training dynamics, whose practical effectiveness needs validation. 2) The lack of discussion on the convergence or stability properties of the proposed dynamic lambda update rule. 3) The connection between the theoretical bounds and the scheduler's decision-making process is stated but not fully detailed. However, these are addressable points within the research process."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML resources and knowledge. The theoretical analysis builds on existing methods. Most algorithmic components (SGD, fairness/robustness regularization) are standard. The experimental plan uses common datasets and evaluation protocols. The main feasibility challenges lie in: 1) Successfully implementing the causal SCM scheduler to provide meaningful guidance with low overhead (<2% claim needs verification). 2) The extensive scope of the experimental validation requires significant computational resources and engineering effort. While ambitious, the project seems implementable, potentially by tackling components sequentially. The risks associated with the novel causal component are manageable research risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: ensuring ML trustworthiness (fairness, robustness) under the ubiquitous constraints of limited computational resources. This is critical for deploying AI ethically in real-world, resource-scarce settings like edge computing and healthcare in developing regions. The potential contributions – fundamental trade-off understanding (bounds), practical adaptive algorithms (EfficientTrust), and open-source tools/guidelines – could lead to major advancements. By aiming to democratize trustworthy AI, the work has substantial potential for both scientific impact (unifying theory and practice) and societal impact (enabling ethical AI deployment more broadly)."
