    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core question about how computational limitations impact trustworthiness (specifically fairness, robustness, and calibration) and proposes methods to understand and mitigate these impacts. It elaborates precisely on the research idea, detailing the empirical quantification, adaptive algorithm development (DynamicTrust), and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, referencing works on multi-objective trade-offs, adaptive resource allocation, and efficient fairness, positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape outlined in the review."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow, breaking down the methodology into empirical, algorithmic, and theoretical components. Specific metrics, datasets, and experimental steps are outlined. Minor details, such as the exact mechanism for hardware profiling or the full derivation of theoretical bounds, are understandably omitted for brevity but the overall plan is exceptionally clear."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing concepts like multi-objective optimization [4], Pareto fronts [5], adaptive allocation [6], and dynamic scheduling [10], it proposes a novel integrated framework, 'DynamicTrust'. This framework's specific design, including the resource monitor, trust scheduler with defined triggers, and early exit mechanism tailored for trustworthiness, represents a fresh approach. Additionally, the plan to theoretically extend existing utility-fairness trade-off work [3] to incorporate computational complexity and derive specific lower bounds (e.g., relating disparity to FLOPS) constitutes a significant novel contribution beyond incremental improvements."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It relies on solid theoretical foundations (multi-objective optimization, information bottleneck) and established methods (adversarial training, debiasing techniques, standard fairness/robustness metrics). The methodology is robust, including controlled experiments, standard benchmarks (ImageNet, MIMIC-III), appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and statistical validation. The technical formulations presented (multi-objective loss, trade-off curve definition) are correct and clearly presented within the context of cited work. The plan to quantify trade-offs using Pareto fronts [5] and convex hulls is methodologically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The empirical evaluation uses standard datasets and techniques common in ML research. Simulating computational constraints (model size, epochs, quantization) is practical. Implementing the 'DynamicTrust' algorithm, which combines existing components with scheduling logic, appears achievable within a typical research project timeframe, although potentially complex. Access to sufficient computational resources for training on datasets like ImageNet and MIMIC-III is necessary but standard for this type of research. The theoretical analysis, while potentially challenging, builds on existing frameworks [3, 11], making it plausible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the tension between computational efficiency and ML trustworthiness, which is a major barrier to deploying ethical AI in resource-constrained but high-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare, autonomous systems), directly aligning with the task description's motivation. The potential contributions – quantified trade-offs, an adaptive algorithm for resource allocation, theoretical bounds, and practical guidelines – could lead to major advancements in deploying trustworthy ML more equitably and reliably. The impact spans practical applications, scientific understanding of fundamental trade-offs, and potentially informing policy and auditing standards."
