    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core question about the impact of computational limitations on ML trustworthiness and the resulting trade-offs. It elaborates comprehensively on the research idea, detailing the empirical analysis, theoretical framework, adaptive algorithms, and evaluation plan. Furthermore, it effectively integrates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as multi-objective optimization, adaptive resource allocation, and the fairness-efficiency trade-off. While the task description also mentions statistical limitations, the proposal's strong focus on computational constraints is explicitly invited by the task and well-justified. It covers multiple trustworthiness dimensions mentioned (fairness, robustness, calibration, privacy), although the proposed algorithms emphasize fairness and robustness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the research objectives. The methodology section is logically structured into four distinct components (empirical analysis, theoretical framework, algorithm development, evaluation), with each part detailing the planned steps, techniques, datasets, and metrics. The mathematical formulations, while high-level as expected in a proposal, are presented clearly. The expected outcomes and impact are well-articulated. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the project's goals and approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing work cited in the literature review (e.g., fairness-utility trade-offs, adaptive allocation), it proposes a novel comprehensive framework ('EfficientTrust') that integrates empirical, theoretical, and algorithmic approaches specifically to balance computational resources and multiple trustworthiness dimensions. The proposed adaptive algorithms (TrustPriority, FET, ART, CAP) offer specific, innovative mechanisms tailored to this balancing act, going beyond generic adaptive methods. The plan to derive theoretical bounds characterizing the functional relationship between resource reduction and trustworthiness degradation, and the systematic empirical mapping of multi-dimensional Pareto frontiers, also contribute to the novelty. The synthesis of these elements into a unified framework focused on resource-constrained trustworthiness is a key innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical concepts (constrained optimization, multi-objective optimization, statistical learning theory) and proposes a well-structured, comprehensive methodology. The empirical plan uses standard practices, datasets, and metrics. The theoretical approach is plausible, although deriving tight, meaningful bounds might be challenging. The proposed algorithms are based on reasonable heuristics and established techniques (dynamic scheduling, adaptive regularization, selective training, model compression), and their high-level descriptions are technically coherent. The evaluation plan is thorough and rigorous, covering diverse benchmarks, scenarios, metrics, and comparisons. The proposal demonstrates a strong understanding of the technical landscape."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. The empirical analysis and algorithm development/evaluation are technically achievable with adequate computational resources and access to standard ML tools. However, the scope is broad, encompassing empirical work, theoretical derivations, development of multiple algorithms, and extensive evaluation across various datasets (including potentially restricted ones like MIMIC-III/UK Biobank requiring specific approvals) and metrics. Successfully executing all components within a typical project timeframe might be challenging and require significant effort or prioritization. The theoretical component carries inherent uncertainty regarding the depth and tightness of achievable bounds. Accessing sensitive datasets adds logistical overhead. Overall, it's feasible but requires careful management and potentially significant resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and increasingly relevant problem: ensuring ML systems are trustworthy even when deployed under computational constraints. This is crucial for democratizing ethical AI, enabling its use in resource-limited settings (SMEs, developing regions, edge devices) where it's currently challenging. The potential impact includes providing practical tools and guidelines for practitioners, advancing theoretical understanding of fundamental trade-offs, contributing to policy discussions, and potentially reducing the environmental footprint of ML. Successfully addressing the 'ethics gap' caused by resource disparity would be a major contribution to the field."
