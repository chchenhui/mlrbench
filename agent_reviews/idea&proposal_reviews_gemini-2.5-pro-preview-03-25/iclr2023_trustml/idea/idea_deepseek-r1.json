        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of understanding the impact of computational limitations on the trustworthiness of ML algorithms, which is a central question posed in the task description ('How do computational limitations impact the trustworthiness of ML algorithms? What are some natural statistical tasks that exhibit fundamental trade-offs between computational efficiency... and trustworthiness...?'). The idea proposes both empirical analysis of these trade-offs and the development of algorithmic techniques (adaptive algorithms) to mitigate them, fitting perfectly with the workshop's goal of discussing barriers and solutions. It focuses specifically on computational constraints and their link to trustworthiness aspects like fairness and robustness, mentioned in the task."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation is concisely stated, highlighting the practical problem. The main idea is broken down into logical steps: empirical quantification, adaptive algorithm development (with a concrete example of a dynamic scheduler), and theoretical analysis. The proposed outcomes (algorithms, guidelines) and validation strategy (benchmarks, clinical data) are explicit. The overall concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While research exists separately on efficient ML and trustworthy ML, the explicit focus on quantifying and algorithmically managing the trade-offs *between* computational resources and trustworthiness metrics using *adaptive* methods is innovative. The concept of a dynamic training scheduler that selectively applies trust-enhancing techniques based on real-time resource availability and model state offers a fresh perspective compared to static approaches to efficiency or trustworthiness. It combines existing fields in a novel way to address a specific, practical challenge."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Empirical quantification can be done using existing ML frameworks and hardware, simulating resource constraints. Developing adaptive algorithms builds on known techniques for efficiency (e.g., model simplification) and trustworthiness (e.g., fairness regularization, adversarial training), making implementation plausible. Integrating these into an adaptive framework presents engineering challenges but is achievable with current ML expertise. Theoretical analysis of trade-offs is standard in ML research, though potentially complex. Validation on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets is practical. The main challenge lies in designing truly effective and generalizable adaptive algorithms, but the overall approach is well within the realm of current research capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and practical problem in deploying ML systems, especially in resource-constrained environments (edge computing, healthcare in low-resource settings) or large-scale systems where efficiency is paramount. Balancing computation with trustworthiness (fairness, robustness) is essential for ethical and reliable AI. Developing algorithms and guidelines for this trade-off could lead to major advancements in deploying trustworthy AI more widely and equitably, reducing disparities and increasing reliability in real-world applications."
