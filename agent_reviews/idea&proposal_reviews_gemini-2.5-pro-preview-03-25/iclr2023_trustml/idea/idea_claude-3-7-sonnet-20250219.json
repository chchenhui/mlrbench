        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the impact of statistical limitations (limited high-quality labeled data) on trustworthiness (privacy). It proposes active learning as a mitigation technique, which is explicitly mentioned in the task's guiding questions. The motivation connects data scarcity and privacy to trustworthiness in sensitive applications, fitting the workshop's theme. While it mentions computational limitations in the motivation and goal, the core mechanism focuses more strongly on the interplay between data limitations and privacy rather than computational constraints, slightly reducing perfect alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, problem statement (dual challenge of data scarcity and privacy), and proposed solution (PPAL framework) are understandable. Key concepts like dynamic balancing, adaptive privacy budget, and uncertainty-guided mechanisms are introduced. However, the specific details of *how* the uncertainty-guided mechanism works, how privacy risk is quantified per sample, and the exact form of the modified acquisition function remain somewhat abstract. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of the novel components."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While combining active learning and differential privacy is an existing research area, the proposed approach includes specific novel elements: dynamically balancing informativeness and privacy risk, an adaptive privacy budget allocation strategy based on sample information content/sensitivity, and particularly the 'uncertainty-guided privacy mechanism' that applies differential privacy non-uniformly based on sample characteristics. This specific mechanism for adaptive privacy within active learning appears innovative, though its distinctiveness compared to all prior art would need thorough verification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. It builds upon established techniques like active learning and differential privacy. Implementing the core framework is achievable with current ML libraries. The main challenges lie in designing, implementing, and theoretically justifying the novel components: the adaptive privacy budget allocation and the uncertainty-guided mechanism. Ensuring that the adaptive privacy mechanism still provides rigorous overall privacy guarantees (e.g., satisfying differential privacy) will require careful theoretical analysis and validation. Empirical evaluation would require suitable datasets, but this is standard for the field."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a critical and practical problem at the intersection of data scarcity and privacy preservation, which is highly relevant for trustworthy ML in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Successfully developing a method that improves data efficiency via active learning while maintaining strong, adaptive privacy guarantees would be a valuable contribution to the field, potentially enabling the deployment of trustworthy ML models in situations where it is currently challenging."
