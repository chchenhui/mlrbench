        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme: the impact of statistical limitations (specifically 'lack of available data', 'limited availability of high-quality labelled data') on a key aspect of trustworthiness ('Fairness'). Furthermore, it proposes an 'active learning' approach as a mitigation strategy, which is explicitly mentioned as an example technique in the task description's guiding questions ('Can these problems be mitigated with new algorithmic techniques (e.g. SSL, new DNN models, active learning)?'). The focus on fairness under data scarcity fits perfectly within the scope of 'Pitfalls of limited data... for Trustworthy ML'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the motivation (bias in models due to scarce data for subgroups), the main objective (proactive fairness mitigation during data acquisition), the proposed method (fairness-aware active learning with new acquisition functions balancing fairness, uncertainty, and representativeness), and the evaluation plan (benchmark datasets, comparison with standard AL). The concepts are immediately understandable with no significant ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. While active learning and fairness in ML are established fields, and fairness-aware active learning has been explored before, the specific focus on developing novel acquisition functions that explicitly balance fairness, uncertainty, and representativeness specifically under *severe* data scarcity conditions offers a potentially novel contribution. The novelty lies less in the overarching concept and more in the specific formulation and application focus, differentiating it from standard active learning or fairness post-processing techniques. It builds significantly on existing work but proposes a refined approach for a specific, challenging setting."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Active learning frameworks, fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds), and benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Adult) are readily available. Implementing and evaluating new acquisition functions is a standard research task in active learning. While designing an acquisition function that *effectively* balances the competing objectives (accuracy, fairness, representativeness) under scarcity is the core research challenge, it does not pose insurmountable implementation barriers with current ML knowledge and computational resources typically available for research."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Fairness is a critical concern in ML deployment, and data scarcity is a pervasive practical challenge, especially concerning underrepresented groups. Developing methods that can proactively improve fairness during the data acquisition phase, even with limited budgets, addresses a crucial real-world problem. Success in this research could lead to more trustworthy and equitable ML systems deployed under resource constraints, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the task description."
