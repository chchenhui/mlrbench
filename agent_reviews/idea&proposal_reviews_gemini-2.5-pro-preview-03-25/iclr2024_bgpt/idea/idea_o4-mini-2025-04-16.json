        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly aims to bridge the gap between theory (loss landscape non-smoothness, Edge-of-Stability phenomenon, curvature) and practice (optimizer design) in deep learning. It explicitly targets topics mentioned in the task description, such as 'Optimization theory for deep learning', 'Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon', 'adaptive optimizers', and 'non-smoothness of neural network landscape'. The proposal focuses on developing a new analysis (curvature-informed optimization) to narrow an existing gap, fulfilling the core objective of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, core mechanism (DCAO using stochastic Lanczos for low-rank Hessian approximation, dynamic adaptation of LR/momentum/WD based on spectral metrics), validation plan (theoretical and empirical), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. Minor details, such as the exact update rules or probing frequency, are understandably omitted in a summary but the overall concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using curvature information in optimization is not entirely new, the proposed approach of using *periodic*, *low-rank* Hessian approximations (via stochastic Lanczos) to extract specific spectral metrics (radius, gap) and *dynamically* adapt standard first-order hyperparameters (LR, momentum, WD) specifically motivated by recent theoretical findings like the Edge-of-Stability phenomenon, represents a novel combination and practical strategy. It differs significantly from standard adaptive methods (like Adam) and full second-order methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Stochastic Lanczos is a known technique for approximating Hessian eigenpairs, and integrating hyperparameter adjustments into training loops is standard. However, computing eigenpairs, even for low-rank approximations, introduces computational overhead compared to first-order methods like Adam. The claim of 'minimal overhead' needs careful validation, as the cost depends heavily on the probing frequency, the number of Lanczos iterations, and the rank 'k'. Theoretical analysis under non-smooth assumptions might also be challenging. Empirical validation requires standard but significant computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the critical and timely problem of designing better optimizers for deep learning by bridging the theory-practice gap, particularly concerning loss landscape geometry and phenomena like EoS. If successful, DCAO could lead to more stable training, faster convergence (especially in regimes where EoS is relevant), and improved generalization, which are highly desirable outcomes. Providing a practical way to leverage curvature information could be a meaningful contribution to the field."
