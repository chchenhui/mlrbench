        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's goal of bridging the theory-practice gap in deep learning optimization, specifically focusing on the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon and the role of curvature, which are highlighted topics. The methodology precisely implements the research idea of a Dynamic Curvature-Aware Optimizer (DCAO) using Lanczos iteration for Hessian approximation and dynamic hyperparameter adjustments. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates and builds upon the provided literature, citing key papers on EoS, adaptive methods, and Hessian-informed optimization, and explicitly aims to operationalize theoretical insights mentioned in those works."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The motivation, objectives, and methodology are articulated concisely and without ambiguity. The DCAO algorithm is presented with clear steps and mathematical formulations for the Hessian approximation and hyperparameter adjustments. The experimental design is detailed, specifying tasks, models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The structure is logical, flowing smoothly from introduction to expected outcomes. While minor implementation details (e.g., specific Lanczos parameters) are omitted (as expected in a proposal), the overall plan and rationale are immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using Hessian information (specifically eigenvalues via Lanczos) for optimization is not entirely new, the proposed DCAO method introduces a novel combination of techniques. It dynamically adjusts multiple hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum, weight decay) based on a richer set of curvature metrics derived from the top-k eigenvalues (spectral radius, spectral gap, negative eigenvalue ratio). This multi-faceted adaptation, explicitly linked to stabilizing EoS dynamics and leveraging spectral properties beyond just the maximum eigenvalue for different hyperparameters, distinguishes it from prior work focusing mainly on learning rate adaptation (like Hi-DLR or ADLER mentioned in the literature). The novelty lies in this specific synthesis and application rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations, including the EoS phenomenon and properties of the Hessian matrix. The use of stochastic Lanczos iteration for eigenvalue approximation is a well-established and computationally efficient technique. The proposed methodology, including the Hessian-vector product approximation and the structure of the DCAO algorithm, is technically sound. The heuristic rules for dynamic hyperparameter adjustment are well-motivated by theoretical considerations (stability threshold, landscape conditioning, saddle points). The inclusion of planned theoretical analysis (convergence rate, connection to self-stabilization theory) adds rigor, although the specific claims (especially Theorem 2) require formal proof. Minor technical details in the formulations appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current deep learning technology and methods. Stochastic Lanczos and Hessian-vector products are implementable in standard frameworks. The core algorithm can be integrated into existing training loops. However, the periodic curvature estimation introduces computational overhead compared to first-order methods, which is a key challenge acknowledged by the proposal. The feasibility hinges on effectively managing this overhead (e.g., via the frequency K) so that the performance gains justify the extra cost. The experimental plan is ambitious (multiple domains, large models) and requires significant computational resources but is standard for the field. Potential issues like noisy estimates and scalability are identified with reasonable mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized problem in deep learning: the gap between optimization theory (especially regarding curvature and EoS) and practical optimizer design. Developing an optimizer that is more stable, converges faster, or finds better generalizing solutions by leveraging curvature information efficiently would be a major advancement. Success could lead to reduced training costs, improved model performance across various domains (CV, NLP, RL as planned), and a deeper, more unified understanding of deep learning optimization dynamics. The potential contribution to both practical tools and theoretical understanding is substantial."
