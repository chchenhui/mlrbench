    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for 'dataset curation, analysis and benchmarking work highlighting opportunities and pitfalls of current ML applications in health and materials' (Topic 1). This proposal directly addresses this by suggesting the creation of a comprehensive benchmark suite for materials property prediction. It also tackles the challenge of multi-scale representations mentioned in the workshop overview and aims to bridge theory and industrial application, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (lack of standardized cross-scale benchmarks), the main proposal (creating a benchmark suite with linked multi-modal datasets for cross-scale tasks), and the expected outcomes (leaderboards, insights, path for industrial tools) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. Examples of modalities and properties provide concrete context."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While benchmarking itself is not new, the specific focus on creating a standardized suite for *cross-scale* property prediction using *linked, multi-modal* datasets (DFT, XRD, graphs, composition) for materials science addresses a recognized gap. Existing benchmarks often focus on single modalities or scales. This proposal's emphasis on explicitly testing cross-scale generalization and data fusion offers a novel contribution to evaluation methodology in this field."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily around data curation. Acquiring or generating high-quality, *linked* datasets representing the same materials across diverse modalities (computational, experimental/simulated, structural) requires substantial effort, resources, and careful data management. While existing databases can be leveraged, integrating and aligning them is non-trivial. However, it relies on established data sources and simulation techniques, making it achievable with dedicated effort rather than depending on unproven technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Standardized benchmarks are crucial for progress in ML, enabling fair model comparison and guiding research directions. Addressing cross-scale generalization and data fusion is critical for developing robust ML models applicable to real-world industrial materials discovery, where data is often multi-faceted. Such a benchmark could accelerate the development and deployment of ML in materials science, contributing to solutions for major societal challenges mentioned in the workshop description (energy, climate)."
