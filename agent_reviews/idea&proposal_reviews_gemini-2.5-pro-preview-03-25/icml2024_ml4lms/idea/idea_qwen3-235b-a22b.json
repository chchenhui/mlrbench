        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea aligns excellently with the task description. The workshop focuses on translational ML for life and material science, bridging theory and practice, and specifically calls for 'novel models and algorithms unlocking capabilities'. This research idea proposes exactly that: a novel hierarchical GNN architecture to address the multi-scale modeling challenge explicitly mentioned in the workshop description ('Different research questions require many levels and scales of representation...'). It targets both life (biomolecular) and materials science, aiming for real-world applications like drug efficacy and material stability prediction, fitting the translational and application-oriented goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of single-scale models), the core concept (hierarchical GNNs, scale-specific representations, inter-level communication, physics-informed losses), and expected outcomes (improved prediction, interpretability, faster screening) are well-defined. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific implementation details of the inter-level communication modules or the exact formulation of the physics-informed losses, but the overall research direction is clearly presented and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While GNNs and hierarchical models are existing concepts, their specific application to create an integrated, multi-scale framework explicitly modeling cross-scale interactions for *both* biomolecular and materials systems simultaneously, coupled with physics-informed constraints across these scales, offers a novel approach. It combines existing techniques in a new way to tackle a complex, integrated problem that is often addressed in isolation for each domain or scale."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant challenges. Building and training complex hierarchical GNNs is computationally intensive. The primary challenge lies in acquiring or curating suitable datasets that capture multi-scale phenomena with known cross-scale dependencies across both biological and materials domains. Integrating heterogeneous data across scales and implementing effective, generalizable physics-informed loss functions across different levels of abstraction will require substantial effort, domain expertise, and potentially new data generation strategies. While conceptually sound, practical implementation faces considerable hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully modeling cross-scale interactions is a fundamental challenge in both life and materials science. Overcoming this limitation could lead to major advancements in drug discovery, materials design, understanding complex biological processes, and developing sustainable technologies â€“ areas directly relevant to the societal challenges mentioned in the task description (health, energy, materials). The potential for interpretable insights into cross-scale mechanisms adds further value beyond predictive accuracy."
