        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics mentioned, including 'interpretable ML methods aligned with clinical reasoning', 'embedding medical knowledge in ML systems', 'graph reasoning in healthcare', and 'uncertainty quantification for medical decision making'. The motivation explicitly targets the need for interpretability and trust in clinical ML, which is the central theme of the workshop task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is very clearly articulated. It outlines the motivation, the core technical approach (GNNs, knowledge graphs, attention, uncertainty methods like evidential deep learning/conformal prediction), the data involved, and the expected outcome (interpretable, uncertainty-aware diagnosis). The concepts are well-defined and the overall goal is immediately understandable. Minor details about specific implementation choices are omitted, but this is appropriate for a research idea summary."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like GNNs, knowledge graphs in medicine, attention mechanisms, and uncertainty quantification methods exist, their specific integration proposed here is innovative. Combining GNNs operating on explicit medical knowledge graphs with attention for interpretability *and* advanced uncertainty quantification techniques (evidential/conformal) specifically for trustworthy clinical diagnosis offers a fresh and promising approach compared to standard black-box models or simpler interpretability methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Required components like GNN libraries, knowledge graph resources (potentially requiring curation), and uncertainty quantification techniques are available. However, integrating these elements effectively, mapping diverse patient data onto a knowledge graph structure accurately, and training the complex model require significant expertise and effort. Data acquisition, preprocessing, and validation in a clinical context also add complexity, making it challenging but achievable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. It addresses the critical barriers of interpretability and trust that hinder the adoption of ML in high-stakes clinical decision-making. Providing explanations grounded in medical knowledge and reliable uncertainty estimates could substantially increase clinician confidence and facilitate safer deployment of AI diagnostic tools. Success could lead to major advancements in trustworthy medical AI."
