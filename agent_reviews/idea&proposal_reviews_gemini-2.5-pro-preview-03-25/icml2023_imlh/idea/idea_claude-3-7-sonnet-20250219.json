        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Interpretable Machine Learning in Healthcare' by proposing a method to enhance trustworthiness and reliability for physicians. Specifically, it tackles key workshop topics like 'Uncertainty quantification for medical decision making', 'Visualization of explanation for model prediction', and implicitly touches upon 'Identification of out-of-distribution/failure prediction' by visualizing uncertainty. The focus on critical care aligns with the task's emphasis on safety and reliability in high-stakes medical decisions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem of trust and lack of uncertainty communication in clinical AI. The main idea proposes a specific solution (dual-channel uncertainty-aware attention maps) using defined techniques (Bayesian NN/dropout ensembles + attention). The intended output and evaluation method (technical validation + physician feedback) are also clearly stated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity, providing a concise yet comprehensive overview."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While attention mechanisms and uncertainty quantification (like dropout-based Bayesian approximation) are existing techniques, the proposed method of integrating them into a single 'uncertainty-aware attention map' specifically for clinical decision support is innovative. The dual-channel visualization approach (color for importance, transparency/texture for uncertainty) offers a fresh perspective on combining explanation with confidence estimation, going beyond separate visualizations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core technical components – attention mechanisms and dropout-based uncertainty estimation – are well-established and implementable with current ML frameworks. The proposal specifically suggests a dropout-based ensemble approach to mitigate the computational cost of full Bayesian NNs, enhancing practicality. Generating the proposed visualizations is technically straightforward. The main challenges, common in medical AI, would be acquiring relevant critical care data and conducting rigorous physician feedback studies, but the core technical proposal is sound and implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical barrier to AI adoption in high-stakes clinical environments like critical care: the lack of trust due to black-box predictions and the absence of uncertainty information. Providing clinicians with interpretable explanations that explicitly incorporate model confidence could substantially improve decision-making quality, enhance patient safety, and foster greater acceptance and reliance on AI decision support systems. Success in this area could lead to major advancements in clinical AI interaction."
