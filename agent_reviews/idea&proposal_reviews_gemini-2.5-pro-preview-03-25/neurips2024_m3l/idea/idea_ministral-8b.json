        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly lists 'Continuous approximations of training trajectories' as a key topic under 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice'. The idea directly addresses this topic, including the specific questions raised in the workshop description about using gradient flow or SDEs and determining the validity of such approximations. Furthermore, the motivation of bridging the theory-practice gap, understanding phenomena like EoS, and improving optimization for large models resonates perfectly with the overall goals and themes outlined in the workshop call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main concept (approximating discrete dynamics with continuous ones), methodology (analysis, validation, framework development), expected outcomes, and potential impact are all articulated concisely and logically. The use of terms like 'gradient flow', 'SDEs', and 'Edge of Stability' is appropriate for the target audience. It is immediately understandable what the research aims to achieve and the general approach. Minor details on the specific mathematical techniques for validation or framework development could be added, but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The core concept of using continuous dynamics (like gradient flow or SDEs) to understand discrete optimization is not entirely new in optimization theory or even in machine learning. However, the novelty lies in its specific application to modern deep learning challenges, particularly understanding phenomena like the Edge of Stability (EoS) in large-scale models and using these insights to design *new* or improved practical optimization algorithms tailored for deep learning. The focus on rigorously connecting these continuous approximations to the complex dynamics of deep networks and deriving practical benefits represents a timely and innovative research direction within the current deep learning theory landscape."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant challenges. Analyzing simple models or specific aspects using continuous approximations is achievable. Empirical validation by comparing continuous predictions with discrete training runs is also feasible. However, developing a rigorous and comprehensive theoretical framework that accurately captures the dynamics of complex, high-dimensional, non-convex deep learning models (especially large ones) is extremely difficult. Proving the validity of approximations under realistic assumptions and deriving provable guarantees for new algorithms based on these continuous views remains a major hurdle in the field. While initial steps are practical, achieving the full scope, particularly the theoretical guarantees for large models, requires substantial effort and potentially new mathematical tools."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical gap between deep learning theory and practice, particularly concerning optimization dynamics which is fundamental to training models effectively and efficiently. Understanding phenomena like EoS and developing theoretically grounded, faster, or more robust optimization algorithms would be major advancements, especially given the prohibitive cost of training large models. Success in this area could provide crucial theoretical guidance, reduce empirical guesswork, lower computational costs, and potentially unlock new capabilities by enabling more effective training regimes."
