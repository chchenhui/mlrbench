        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on the 'Effect of Data' in foundation models, specifically asking 'How does the number of data passes affect training, and can we consolidate the empirical and theoretical understanding?'. This proposal directly addresses this question by aiming to develop a theoretical framework for understanding data epochs (passes) in LLM pretraining, linking it to efficiency and representation quality. It fits squarely within the workshop's goal of using mathematical tools to understand modern ML phenomena, particularly for large models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (poor understanding of data recycling effects), the proposed approach (theoretical framework using stochastic optimization/information geometry), the specific aspects to analyze (gradient stats, loss landscape, convergence, generalization, representation), and the expected outcomes (heuristics, validation) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It clearly outlines the problem, the method, and the goals."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While data recycling is practiced and optimization/generalization are studied, developing a dedicated theoretical framework using tools like stochastic optimization theory and potentially information geometry specifically to model the impact of *multiple epochs* on LLM pretraining dynamics (gradient statistics, loss landscape, representation quality) is a relatively fresh perspective. Much existing work relies on empirical findings or simpler theoretical models. This proposal aims for a more principled, theoretically grounded understanding tailored to modern LLMs, which constitutes a good degree of novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents challenges. Theoretically analyzing the complex, non-convex dynamics of large LLMs under data repetition is ambitious and will likely require simplifying assumptions. Deriving tight, practical bounds might be difficult. Experimentally validating the theoretical findings on 'representative model architectures' is feasible but computationally expensive, requiring significant resources, especially if aiming for larger scales. However, within a well-resourced research setting, both theoretical progress and meaningful experiments are achievable, making it largely feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. LLM pretraining consumes vast resources. Understanding the optimal number of data epochs has direct implications for training efficiency, potentially saving enormous amounts of computation, energy, and time. Providing theoretically grounded guidelines would move beyond current empirical heuristics, offering a more principled approach to training large models. Insights into how data repetition affects convergence, generalization, and representation quality are fundamentally important for the field."
