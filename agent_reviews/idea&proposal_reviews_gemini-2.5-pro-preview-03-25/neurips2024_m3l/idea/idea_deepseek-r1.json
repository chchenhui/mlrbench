        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly lists 'Why does Adam optimize faster than SGD on Transformers?' as a key question under the topic 'Advanced optimization algorithms' within 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice'. The proposed research directly tackles this question, investigating the interplay between Adam's adaptive nature and the specific gradient structures within Transformers. The motivation also aligns perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on developing theory to guide the practice of training large models efficiently."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It presents a specific hypothesis (layer-wise gradient heterogeneity in Transformers explains Adam's advantage) and outlines a logical, multi-step methodology (empirical profiling, dynamical systems modeling, controlled experiments) to test it. The motivation, core concept, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While the empirical observation that Adam outperforms SGD on Transformers is well-known, and research exists on adaptive methods and gradient properties, this proposal focuses specifically on *layer-wise gradient heterogeneity* as the key explanatory factor. Combining empirical gradient analysis across layers with dynamical systems modeling tailored to Transformer components (LayerNorm, residuals) to explain Adam's success represents a fresh perspective on this specific problem. It's not proposing a completely new optimization paradigm but offers a novel investigation into the mechanism behind a widely observed phenomenon."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly practical and implementable. The proposed methodology relies on established techniques: 1) Empirical gradient profiling is achievable using standard deep learning frameworks and instrumentation. 2) Dynamical systems modeling of optimizers is a known research area, and while complex, applying it here is feasible. 3) Designing controlled experiments with synthetic data or modified architectures is standard practice in ML research. Access to computational resources for training moderate-sized Transformers is required but is standard for this type of research. No fundamentally new technology or unavailable data is needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the precise reasons for Adam's effectiveness on Transformers, the dominant architecture for large language models, is a critical open question. Successfully executing this research could lead to a theoretical framework that enables more principled design of optimizers for large-scale models. Potential impacts include faster convergence, reduced hyperparameter sensitivity, lower computational costs, and more energy-efficient training protocols, all of which are crucial for the current trajectory of foundation models."
