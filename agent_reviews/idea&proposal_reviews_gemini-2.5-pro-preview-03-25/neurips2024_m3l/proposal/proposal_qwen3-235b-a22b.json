    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core research idea of understanding and optimizing data epochs in LLM pretraining. It fits squarely within the workshop's scope, particularly the topic 'Effect of Data' under 'Intriguing phenomena of foundation models', and the goal of 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice'. The proposal explicitly aims to consolidate empirical observations (cited from the literature review, e.g., Doe & Smith, Blue & Red) with theoretical understanding (addressing the lack of theory challenge), using methods (stochastic optimization, information geometry) mentioned in the literature (Johnson & Lee, Grey & White) and task description. It comprehensively integrates the background, problem statement, and prior work into a coherent research plan."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely and persuasively. The methodology section is detailed, outlining specific theoretical tools (gradient statistics, FIM, PAC-Bayes) with relevant equations and a structured experimental plan (datasets, models, protocols, metrics). The expected outcomes are clearly linked to the objectives. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving no ambiguity about the research goals or approach. The mathematical formulation for the adaptive rule, though needing development, is clearly presented conceptually."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While data recycling and its effects are known issues (as per the literature review), the novelty lies in the proposed *integrated theoretical framework* combining stochastic optimization analysis (gradient statistics), information geometry (FIM dynamics), and generalization theory (PAC-Bayes bounds) specifically tailored to LLM pretraining data recycling. Existing theoretical work (Johnson & Lee, Grey & White) appears less comprehensive or integrated. Furthermore, the goal of deriving *analytic bounds* and *adaptive heuristics* directly from this unified theory, validated across significant model scales (up to 10B parameters), represents a substantial step beyond existing empirical heuristics (White & Black) or more general theoretical treatments. The synthesis of these specific theoretical tools for this practical problem is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations relevant to deep learning analysis (stochastic optimization, information geometry, PAC-Bayes). The proposed methodology is robust, combining theoretical derivations with a well-designed experimental validation plan that includes controlled comparisons, scaling studies, and diverse metrics. The use of FIM to study loss landscape geometry and PAC-Bayes for epoch-dependent bounds are appropriate choices. The technical formulations presented are standard and correct, providing a strong basis for the planned theoretical work. The approach directly addresses the need for theoretical grounding highlighted in the literature review."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant challenges. The theoretical development, while using established tools, involves complex analysis, and deriving tight, practical bounds for LLMs is notoriously difficult. The experimental plan, particularly training models up to 10B parameters across various conditions, requires substantial computational resources (GPU time, data storage, processing infrastructure) which may not be readily available. Implementing and validating the adaptive heuristics effectively also requires careful engineering and tuning. While the individual components are conceptually feasible, the scale and theoretical ambition introduce moderate risks regarding resource availability and the tractability/utility of the theoretical results. The score reflects good feasibility contingent on significant resources and acknowledging the inherent research challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in modern AI â€“ the immense cost and environmental impact of LLM pretraining. Providing a principled understanding and practical heuristics for data recycling could lead to substantial reductions (estimated 20-40%) in computational requirements, making LLM development more efficient, sustainable, and accessible. Theoretically, advancing the understanding of optimization, generalization, and memorization dynamics under data repetition in overparametrized models is a fundamental contribution. The potential to inform training stability, data usage policies, and even mitigate memorization-related risks further enhances its significance."
