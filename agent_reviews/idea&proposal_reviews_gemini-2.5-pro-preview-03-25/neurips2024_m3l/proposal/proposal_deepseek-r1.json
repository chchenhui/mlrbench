    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Effect of Data' topic mentioned in the workshop task description, specifically the question of how data passes affect training and the need to consolidate empirical and theoretical understanding. It fully fleshes out the research idea, including the theoretical framework, analysis of gradient statistics, generalization bounds, and experimental validation. Furthermore, it correctly positions itself within the provided literature, acknowledging prior empirical work (Doe & Smith, Marion et al.) and theoretical attempts (Johnson & Lee, Grey & White), and explicitly aims to bridge the identified gap between empirical practice and theoretical understanding regarding data recycling in LLM pretraining."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The research objectives are explicitly stated and easy to understand. The methodology section clearly outlines both the theoretical framework (with specific mathematical formulations for gradient dynamics, SDE approximation, and generalization bounds) and the experimental design (datasets, models, metrics, baselines). The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methods, expected outcomes, and impact. The language is precise and academic, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the planned work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the study of data repetition is not entirely new (as evidenced by the literature review), the proposal's novelty lies in its aim to develop a *unified* theoretical framework specifically for LLMs, connecting stochastic optimization theory (gradient statistics, SDEs), generalization theory (PAC-Bayes), and representation quality analysis (CKA, probing tasks). It seeks to derive specific bounds and practical guidelines linking the number of passes (k) to performance and efficiency, going beyond existing empirical observations or more general theoretical treatments. The synthesis of these different theoretical tools and their application to LLM pretraining, coupled with a strong empirical validation plan, constitutes a novel contribution, even if it builds upon existing concepts."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in established theoretical frameworks like stochastic optimization and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The proposed methods, including modeling gradient variance decay, using SDE approximations for continuous-time analysis, and deriving generalization bounds, are standard and appropriate tools for this type of investigation. The technical formulations presented are plausible and correctly conceptualized. The experimental design is well-thought-out, including relevant datasets, model scales, comprehensive evaluation metrics (convergence, generalization, representation quality, efficiency), and appropriate baselines, ensuring a robust empirical validation of the theoretical findings."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The theoretical analysis employs standard mathematical techniques, although the derivations might be complex. The experimental plan uses well-known datasets (C4, Pile), standard model architectures (GPT variants), and established evaluation benchmarks (GLUE, CKA). Training scaled-down LLMs requires significant computational resources, which is a potential bottleneck but standard for LLM research and achievable in well-equipped labs. The steps are clearly defined, and the overall plan appears realistic, with manageable research risks typical of theoretical and empirical ML work."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and practical problem in modern AI: the immense cost and resource consumption of LLM pretraining. Providing theoretically grounded guidelines for optimal data recycling (k) could lead to substantial reductions in computational cost and energy usage, making LLM development more accessible and sustainable. Furthermore, advancing the theoretical understanding of optimization dynamics, generalization, and representation learning under data repetition in the overparameterized regime is a valuable contribution to machine learning theory, directly aligning with the goals outlined in the workshop task description."
