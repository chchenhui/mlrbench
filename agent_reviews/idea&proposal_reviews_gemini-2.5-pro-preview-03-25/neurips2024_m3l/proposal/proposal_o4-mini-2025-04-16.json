        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on reconciling optimization theory with deep learning practice, specifically tackling the 'Effect of Data' in foundation model pretraining by investigating optimal data epochs. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the theoretical framework (stochastic optimization, information geometry) and empirical validation plan. Furthermore, it explicitly engages with the provided literature, citing relevant works on data repetition effects, theoretical analyses, practical heuristics, and data quality, and aims to address the key challenges identified in the review (overfitting, efficiency-performance balance, lack of theory)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section is logically structured, explaining the theoretical framework with specific equations (modeling gradient autocorrelation \\\\rho, deriving convergence/generalization bounds via N_{\\\\rm eff}(E), information geometry perspective), outlining the algorithm, and detailing a comprehensive experimental design (models, data, metrics, controls, repetitions). Expected outcomes and impact are also clearly stated. Minor ambiguities might exist in the exact derivation of the E^* heuristic, but the overall plan and rationale are immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building upon existing work identified in the literature review (empirical studies on repetition, prior theoretical analyses, information geometry applications, data quality metrics), it proposes a specific and potentially novel theoretical synthesis. Key novel elements include the explicit modeling of gradient autocorrelation (\\\\rho) across epochs to derive an effective sample size (N_{\\\\rm eff}(E)) that links convergence and generalization, the integration of this optimization perspective with information geometry for representation quality, the systematic empirical validation across model scales, and the proposed development of a practical heuristic (E^*) and associated tool. It offers a fresh, integrated perspective rather than being purely incremental."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It grounds its theoretical framework in established stochastic optimization principles and information geometry. The core assumptions (e.g., gradient autocorrelation model with parameter \\\\rho) are reasonable starting points for analysis, although potentially simplifications. The derived bounds (Eq. 1-4) appear plausible within standard theoretical ML contexts. The experimental design is rigorous, specifying architectures, data, controls, comprehensive metrics, and statistical validation procedures. The plan to empirically measure \\\\hat{\\\\rho} and compare theory with practice strengthens the proposal. Minor weaknesses include the potential oversimplification of the \\\\rho model and the brief justification for the E^* heuristic."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current technology and methods (Transformer training, standard evaluation benchmarks, gradient analysis). The theoretical derivations are standard exercises in optimization theory. However, the empirical validation plan, involving pretraining multiple large models (up to 2.7B parameters) for multiple epochs (E=1,2,4,8) with repetitions, is computationally very demanding and requires significant GPU resources. While typical for LLM research, this poses a practical challenge and potential risk depending on resource availability. Assuming adequate compute, the research plan is realistic and the steps are clearly defined."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical, practical problem in large-scale AI: the efficient pretraining of LLMs, where choosing the number of data epochs is often heuristic and tuning is extremely costly. Providing a theoretically grounded framework and practical heuristics for optimizing data epochs could lead to substantial savings in computational resources, energy, and time, potentially democratizing access to large model training. Furthermore, it promises to advance the fundamental understanding of optimization dynamics and generalization in the context of data recycling, bridging the theory-practice gap highlighted by the workshop."
