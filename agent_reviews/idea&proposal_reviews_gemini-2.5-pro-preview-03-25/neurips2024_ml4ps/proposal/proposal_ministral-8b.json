    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on ML for Physical Sciences (PS) and PS for ML, particularly the theme of data-driven vs. inductive bias-driven methods and the role of physical constraints. It logically expands on the provided research idea, detailing the motivation, PG-SSL concept, and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it is well-situated within the provided literature, acknowledging related work (like physics-guided methods and SSL) and aiming to address key challenges identified (limited labeled data, physical consistency)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology, and expected impact are stated plainly. The structure is logical and easy to follow. However, crucial technical details regarding the 'differentiable physics modules' and the specific design of 'physics-aware pretext tasks' beyond a single example are lacking. How these components are technically implemented and integrated into the SSL framework remains somewhat ambiguous, preventing perfect clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core idea of combining self-supervised learning with physical constraints is relevant and valuable, but it is not entirely original, as evidenced by the literature review (e.g., Papers 2, 7, 9 discuss physics-aware SSL or related concepts). The proposal presents PG-SSL as a general framework, but it doesn't sufficiently detail *what* makes this specific framework or its proposed pretext tasks significantly different or more advanced than existing approaches. The novelty seems incremental rather than groundbreaking, focusing on synthesizing and applying existing ideas."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established principles of self-supervised learning and physics-informed machine learning. The motivation is well-justified, and the high-level methodology (integrating physics via pretext tasks and differentiable modules) is plausible. The use of soft constraints and differentiable physics is a recognized approach. However, the lack of specific technical formulations for the constraints, modules, and their integration into the SSL loss function prevents a higher score. The theoretical basis is solid, but the technical rigor is not fully demonstrated in the proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible within a well-equipped research setting. It requires access to significant unlabeled scientific datasets and substantial computational resources for pretraining, which is typical for SSL research. Key challenges include the domain-specific design of effective physics-aware pretext tasks and the potentially complex implementation of differentiable physics modules. While challenging, these aspects are generally within the realm of current ML research capabilities. The plan is logical, but execution risks related to implementation complexity and computational cost exist."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses two critical bottlenecks in applying ML to scientific domains: the scarcity of labeled data and the need for physically consistent models. By proposing a method to leverage abundant unlabeled data while incorporating physical laws, the research has the potential to significantly advance scientific discovery across multiple fields (fluid dynamics, materials science, climate modeling). It directly tackles the interplay between data-driven and physics-informed methods, a key topic in the field, potentially leading to more reliable and data-efficient scientific ML models."
