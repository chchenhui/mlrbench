    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for research on generative models (LLMs) for structured data, focusing specifically on tabular data generation, a listed application. It faithfully elaborates on the provided research idea, detailing the multi-agent framework, RAG, schema validation, quality assessment, and privacy aspects. Furthermore, it positions itself well within the provided literature, acknowledging recent relevant work (HARMONIC, TabuLa, etc.) and aiming to integrate several key concepts (LLMs, constraints, privacy, multi-agent systems, RAG) to tackle the identified challenges like schema compliance and privacy preservation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology is broken down into logical steps (RAG LLM, Schema Validator, Quality Assessor, DP, Evaluation). The overall structure is logical and easy to follow. However, some technical details could be slightly more specific for perfect clarity, such as the exact mechanism for chain-of-thought schema verification, the precise nature of the 'corrective signals' fed back to the LLM, and the specific differential privacy algorithm envisioned. Despite these minor points, the core concepts and research plan are communicated effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using LLMs for synthetic tabular data generation is an active research area (as shown in the literature review), the novelty lies in the proposed integrated multi-agent framework (SynthTab). Specifically, the combination of a RAG-based LLM generator, a dedicated Schema Validator using chain-of-thought verification, a Quality Assessor providing feedback for iterative refinement, and integrated differential privacy within a single, cohesive system appears novel. It synthesizes several recent techniques (RAG, CoT for validation, multi-agent structure) in a unique configuration aimed at addressing multiple challenges simultaneously, distinguishing it from prior work focusing on subsets of these aspects."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established concepts like LLMs, RAG, differential privacy, and iterative refinement. The multi-agent approach is logical for separating concerns (generation, validation, quality). However, some aspects require further justification or detail to be fully convincing. For example, the effectiveness and scalability of chain-of-thought for complex schema validation (especially referential integrity and business rules) need more substantiation. The mechanism for translating quality/validation feedback into effective 'corrective signals' for the LLM is underspecified. While grounded in relevant literature, the proposal could benefit from more detailed technical formulation regarding these specific mechanisms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. It requires access to capable LLMs, potentially substantial compute resources for fine-tuning and inference, and expertise across LLMs, data constraints, privacy, and multi-agent systems. Implementing robust schema validation (especially complex rules) and integrating it effectively within an iterative loop with an LLM and DP is non-trivial. Fine-tuning an LLM to respond well to corrective signals based on both statistical quality and hard constraints needs careful execution. While plausible within a well-resourced research environment, the complexity of integrating all components successfully poses a moderate risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and persistent challenge of generating high-fidelity, privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data that adheres to real-world constraints. This is a major bottleneck in many domains (finance, healthcare) relying on tabular data. A successful SynthTab framework could unlock significant advancements by enabling better model training via data augmentation in low-data regimes and facilitating safer data sharing for collaboration and research. It directly tackles key limitations of existing methods identified in the literature and aligns perfectly with the practical challenges mentioned in the workshop call."
