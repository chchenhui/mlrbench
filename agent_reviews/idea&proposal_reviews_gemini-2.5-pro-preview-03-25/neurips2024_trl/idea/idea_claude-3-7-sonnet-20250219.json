        "justification": "The TabEns idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop topic 'Representation Learning for (semi-)Structured Data' by proposing a new model architecture (ensemble). It also targets 'Applications of TRL models' by focusing on improving performance for tasks like text-to-SQL and table question answering, which are explicitly mentioned or implied in the call. The approach implicitly touches upon 'Multimodal Learning' by combining different views (semantic, structural, numerical) of the table data. It fits squarely within the core themes and interests of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of single representations) is well-stated. The core concept (ensemble of diverse representations - sequence, graph, numerical) and the fusion mechanism (gated attention) are clearly described. The mention of preliminary results, computational efficiency via distillation, and modularity adds further clarity. While specific model choices or the exact distillation process could be detailed further, the overall idea is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While ensemble learning itself is not new, applying it specifically to combine diverse *types* of table representations (sequence, graph, numerical) using a dynamic fusion mechanism like gated attention for TRL tasks offers a fresh perspective. Most prior work focuses on refining a single representation type. This combination and the specific focus on integrating complementary strengths for table understanding constitute a notable innovation within the TRL field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly practical and implementable. The core components—sequence models (like Transformers), graph neural networks, numerical embedding techniques, and attention mechanisms—are well-established in the ML community. Combining them in an ensemble architecture is technically straightforward. The required datasets (e.g., Spider, WikiSQL) are publicly available benchmarks. While training multiple models might increase computational cost, the proposal acknowledges this and suggests distillation as a mitigation strategy, further enhancing feasibility."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a recognized limitation in TRL—that single representations struggle to capture all facets of complex tabular data. If the claimed 8-12% performance improvements on key benchmarks like Spider and WikiSQL hold up under rigorous evaluation, it would represent a meaningful advancement for important downstream applications. The modular design also suggests potential for broad applicability across different domains, increasing its overall significance."
