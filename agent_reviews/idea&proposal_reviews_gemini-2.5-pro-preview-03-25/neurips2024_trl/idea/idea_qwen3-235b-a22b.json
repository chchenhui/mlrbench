    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics of the Table Representation Learning Workshop, including 'Representation Learning for (semi-)Structured Data' (proposing a new model architecture and encoding techniques), 'Multimodal Learning' (combining tables with text/SQL), and 'Applications of TRL models' (targeting text-to-SQL and table QA/understanding). It also touches upon pre-training techniques and enhancing LLM capabilities for structured data, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation clearly states the problem (lack of structural awareness in existing models). The main idea is broken down into understandable components (Schema Encoder, Cell Encoder, Structure-Aware Attention). The proposed training methodology (pre-training, fine-tuning) and target benchmarks are specified. While finer implementation details of the 'Structure-Aware Attention' or 'relational embeddings' could be elaborated, the overall concept and approach are well-defined and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. While using Transformers for tables (e.g., TAPAS, TaBERT) and hierarchical modeling (e.g., HiTab) are not entirely new, the proposed approach combines these elements with a specific focus on explicitly modeling schema hierarchies, cell data types via adapters, and structurally constrained attention within a single architecture. The novelty lies more in the specific architectural design choices (the three encoders, structure-aware attention mechanism) and their integration for multimodal pre-training, rather than introducing a completely new paradigm. It represents a potentially valuable refinement and combination of existing concepts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It builds upon the well-established Transformer architecture and standard machine learning techniques like positional encodings, modality adapters, and contrastive learning. Implementing custom encoders and attention mechanisms is achievable within modern deep learning frameworks. Required datasets (like WikiSQL, TabMWP) are available. The main challenge, typical for such models, would be the computational resources required for large-scale pre-training, but this does not render the idea infeasible from a technical standpoint."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Effectively capturing the complex hierarchical and relational structure of tables is a critical challenge in the field. Current models often lose this information, limiting performance on tasks requiring deep understanding. Success in this research could lead to substantial improvements in key applications like text-to-SQL generation, table question answering, and automated data analysis. Furthermore, enhancing models' ability to process structured data robustly could have broader implications for LLMs and multimodal AI systems."
