    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description (Table Representation Learning Workshop). It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the call for papers, including 'Representation Learning for (semi-)Structured Data' (specifically tables), 'Multimodal Learning' (explicitly combining tabular data with text and code), and 'Applications of TRL models' (mentioning semantic parsing and question answering). The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's premise of exploring under-utilized tabular data and the potential of combining modalities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation, main components (encoders for table, text, code; multi-head attention fusion), methodology steps, expected outcomes, and potential impact are clearly articulated and logically structured. While specific architectural details are omitted (as expected in a high-level idea), the overall concept and research plan are well-defined and easily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates satisfactory novelty. While multimodal learning and using attention for fusion are established concepts, and prior work exists on combining tabular data with text (e.g., TAPAS, TaBERT) or code, the specific combination of tabular data with *both* text and code using dedicated encoders and a fusion mechanism for enhancing general tabular representation learning offers some originality. However, the description doesn't detail fundamentally new techniques, suggesting it builds significantly upon existing approaches rather than introducing a groundbreaking paradigm. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and application focus."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible. The proposed components (data-specific encoders, attention mechanisms) are standard building blocks in modern machine learning. The methodology (preprocessing, pre-training, fusion, fine-tuning, evaluation) follows established research practices. Suitable datasets and computational resources (GPUs) are generally available for this type of work. While challenges like data alignment and balancing modalities exist, they are common in multimodal research and appear surmountable with current techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Improving representation learning for ubiquitous tabular data is an important research direction. Enhancing performance on tasks like semantic parsing and question answering over tables has clear practical value for data analysis, business intelligence, and information access. Successfully integrating code alongside text could capture richer semantics than text alone. If the proposed method yields substantial improvements, it could meaningfully advance how structured data is processed and understood, aligning well with the workshop's goals."
