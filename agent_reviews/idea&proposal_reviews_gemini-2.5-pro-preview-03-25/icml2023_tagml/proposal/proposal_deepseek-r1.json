    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (TAG-ML workshop focusing on geometry in ML), the research idea (geometric message passing for dynamic graphs), and the literature review (addressing limitations like geometric structure handling, long-range dependencies). It directly proposes using differential geometry and Riemannian manifolds (key TAG-ML topics) to create novel algorithms for dynamic graphs, aiming for improved performance and interpretability, all of which are highlighted in the task description and motivated by the research idea and literature review gaps."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section clearly outlines the geometric representation, the specific manifold-aware operators (parallel transport, geodesic attention, curvature aggregation) with concise mathematical formulations, and a detailed experimental plan (datasets, baselines, metrics, implementation choices). The rationale and significance are well-articulated, and the overall structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by specifically integrating Riemannian manifold concepts (parallel transport for temporal consistency, geodesic attention, curvature-aware aggregation) into the message passing mechanism for *dynamic* graphs. While geometric deep learning exists for static graphs and dynamic graph methods exist, this particular combination and the design of the geometric operators tailored for temporal evolution appear innovative and distinct from the cited literature (e.g., TGNs, EvolveGCN, GN-CDE focus on different mechanisms)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in differential geometry and established GNN principles. The proposed geometric operators are conceptually well-grounded extensions for non-Euclidean spaces. The mathematical formulations are presented clearly and appear correct, although detailed derivations are omitted (as expected in a proposal). The use of Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Riemannian optimization methods is appropriate. Minor gaps exist concerning the practical complexities of computing these geometric quantities efficiently and the need for empirical validation of theoretical claims (e.g., stability proofs)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Expertise in both GNNs and differential geometry is required. While libraries for Riemannian optimization exist, implementing custom parallel transport, geodesic distance calculations, and curvature estimations efficiently for dynamic graphs will require significant effort. Computational cost, especially for large graphs or complex manifolds, could be a concern. The experimental plan is realistic, but achieving the specific quantitative performance improvements (≥15% MAE, ≥10% AUC-ROC) is ambitious and carries risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses critical limitations in dynamic graph learning concerning the incorporation of geometric structure, long-range dependencies, and interpretability. Success would represent a substantial methodological advancement at the intersection of geometry and machine learning. The potential for improved performance in important applications (traffic forecasting, social dynamics, potentially biology/physics) and the generation of new theoretical insights and interpretability tools make the research highly impactful for the field and relevant to the TAG-ML workshop's goals."
