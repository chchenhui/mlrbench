        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core research idea of using Riemannian geometry for dynamic graph learning. It fits perfectly within the scope of the TAG-ML workshop by proposing a novel algorithm rooted in geometric machine learning, aiming for improved performance and interpretability. The methodology explicitly incorporates concepts like parallel transport, geodesics, and curvature, as outlined in the idea. Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to overcome limitations of existing dynamic GNNs (like EvolveGCN, ROLAND, TGNs mentioned in the literature review) by moving beyond Euclidean assumptions, addressing challenges highlighted such as capturing complex dependencies and incorporating geometric structure."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology section breaks down the proposed framework into distinct components (manifold representation, message passing, attention, aggregation) and provides relevant mathematical formulations (log/exp maps, parallel transport, geodesic distance). While the concepts from differential geometry are advanced, the proposal explains *what* is intended clearly. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, perhaps regarding the practical computation of curvature or parallel transport on discrete graphs, but the overall proposal is understandable and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. While geometric deep learning on static graphs exists, applying Riemannian manifold concepts—specifically parallel transport for temporal message passing, geodesic attention across space and time, and curvature-aware aggregation—to the *dynamic* graph setting represents a significant conceptual leap. The literature review confirms that current state-of-the-art dynamic GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean space or use different temporal modeling techniques (RNNs, CDEs). This proposal introduces a fundamentally different perspective by modeling graph evolution as trajectories on manifolds and leveraging specific geometric tools to constrain and inform the learning process. The combination of these specific geometric mechanisms for dynamic graphs is novel."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid mathematical foundations from differential geometry (Riemannian manifolds, tangent spaces, parallel transport, geodesics, curvature). The proposed methodology logically extends the message-passing paradigm to this geometric setting. The mathematical formulations presented appear correct for the intended operations. The inclusion of standard datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies indicates methodological rigor. Minor weaknesses include the need for further justification on the choice of specific manifolds for specific tasks and the practical details of approximating continuous geometric concepts (like curvature and parallel transport) on discrete graph structures, though these are common challenges in geometric ML."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Implementing operations like parallel transport, geodesic distance computation, and curvature estimation on manifolds within a dynamic GNN framework requires significant expertise in both differential geometry and deep learning libraries. These geometric operations can also be computationally expensive compared to standard Euclidean operations, potentially impacting scalability, which the proposal acknowledges by planning to benchmark runtime. However, the use of standard public datasets and the existence of geometric ML libraries (like Geomstats) suggest that implementation is achievable within a well-resourced research environment. The plan is generally realistic, with manageable risks primarily related to technical complexity and computational cost."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of existing dynamic graph models—their inability to effectively capture non-Euclidean structure and complex temporal evolution. Success would likely lead to substantial performance improvements in important application domains like traffic forecasting, epidemic modeling, and social network analysis. Furthermore, the integration of geometric concepts like curvature and geodesics offers promising avenues for enhanced model interpretability, a key challenge in deep learning. By bridging differential geometry and dynamic graph learning, the research has the potential to open new theoretical and practical directions in the field, aligning perfectly with the goals of the TAG-ML community."
