        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly proposes using a topological method (persistent homology) to create a novel training scheme (curriculum learning based on topological complexity). This directly addresses the workshop's focus on applying topology to machine learning, specifically targeting listed topics like 'Training Methods', 'Robustness', 'Performance', and potentially 'Performance Guarantees'. It fits perfectly within the scope of bringing TAG methods to bear on challenging ML questions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core mechanism (persistent homology for complexity scoring, curriculum progression), integration method (gradient weighting), and expected outcomes are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise method for computing persistent homology on 'feature clouds' (which layer? what representation?) and the exact mechanism for weighting gradients, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While curriculum learning itself is established, using persistent homology to quantify intrinsic data complexity for guiding the curriculum is a novel approach. Applying this topological measure dynamically during training, potentially integrated into the optimization process via gradient weighting, represents a fresh perspective compared to existing curriculum strategies often based on model loss or simpler heuristics. It innovatively combines TDA with deep learning training dynamics."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology, but presents moderate implementation challenges. Computing persistent homology can be computationally intensive, especially for high-dimensional data or large batches. Applying it to embeddings rather than raw pixels might mitigate this, but it still adds computational overhead to the training loop. Integrating complexity-based weighting into optimizers is technically straightforward. The main challenge lies in efficiently computing and utilizing the topological scores at scale during training. Requires expertise in both ML and computational topology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. If successful, it could provide a principled, data-driven method to improve training stability, accelerate convergence, and enhance model robustness and generalization across various domains (vision, graphs, text). It addresses the fundamental challenge of training models on data with heterogeneous complexity. Furthermore, it offers a concrete application of advanced topological methods to core machine learning processes, potentially stimulating further research at the intersection of TDA and deep learning."
