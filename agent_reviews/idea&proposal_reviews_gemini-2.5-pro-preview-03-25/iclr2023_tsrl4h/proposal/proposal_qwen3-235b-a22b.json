    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key themes: representation learning for health, label scarcity (via active learning), handling missing/irregular data (imputation-aware augmentations, temporal embeddings), high dimensionality (Transformer), robustness, interpretability (prototypes), and application to a minority group (pediatrics/ICU). The methodology clearly elaborates on the research idea's core components. It effectively positions itself against the cited literature, identifying gaps (e.g., lack of integrated active learning and interpretability in some prior works like SLAC-Time, STraTS, APC) and proposing solutions consistent with the identified challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The objectives, motivation, and overall methodology (three core components) are clearly presented. The algorithmic details, data source, experimental setup, and evaluation metrics are generally well-defined. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement: the exact mechanism of 'imputation-aware augmentations' beyond naming techniques like masking/shifting could be more detailed, the justification for the specific 'estimated 60%' label reduction target isn't fully elaborated in the methodology, and the prototype refinement optimization details are brief. However, these are minor points, and the proposal is largely understandable and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality through the specific *synthesis* of imputation-aware contrastive self-supervision, uncertainty-diversity active learning tailored for time series windows, and prototype-based interpretability within a unified framework for pediatric clinical time series. While individual components (contrastive learning, active learning, prototypes, Transformers for time series) exist in the literature (as acknowledged by citing [1-5]), their integration in this specific manner, particularly the active learning strategy combined with prototypes for this application, offers a fresh perspective. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work like STraTS [3] or APC [4] by adding active learning and explicit interpretability layers."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, Transformers, active learning principles, prototype methods). The methodology is well-justified, using appropriate techniques like continuous time embeddings [3] for irregular data and a standard contrastive loss. The active learning criterion combining uncertainty and MMD-based diversity [5] is established. The experimental design using eICU data, sepsis prediction task, relevant metrics (AUROC, F1, sensitivity), and comparison baselines (APC, STraTS) is appropriate. Technical formulations are presented correctly. Minor areas requiring careful validation include the precise impact of 'imputation-aware' augmentations on preserving data structure and ensuring the clinical relevance of learned prototypes, which the proposal plans to assess via clinician feedback."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages a known dataset (eICU) and standard machine learning techniques (Transformers, contrastive learning) implementable with existing libraries. The main challenge lies in the 'clinician-in-the-loop' aspect: securing sufficient and timely input from clinical experts for annotating actively selected samples and evaluating interpretability. While active learning aims to reduce this burden, it still requires dedicated expert time, which can be a bottleneck. Achieving the ambitious quantitative targets (60% label reduction, 12% accuracy boost) also presents a risk. However, the overall plan is realistic, and the risks are manageable with proper planning and collaboration."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical, well-recognized barriers to deploying ML in healthcare: the need for large labeled datasets, robustness to imperfect real-world data, and the lack of model interpretability hindering clinician trust. By focusing on pediatric ICU data (a minority group highlighted in the task description) and a high-stakes problem (sepsis detection), the potential clinical impact is substantial. Success could lead to more efficient development of trustworthy clinical decision support tools. The methodological contribution of integrating active learning and interpretability with self-supervised representation learning for time series also holds broader relevance for ML research."
