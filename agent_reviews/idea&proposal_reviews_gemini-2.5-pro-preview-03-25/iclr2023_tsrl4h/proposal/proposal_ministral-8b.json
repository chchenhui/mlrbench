        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: time series representation learning for health, challenges like labeling scarcity (active learning), missing/irregular data (imputation-aware augmentations), high dimensionality (representation learning), and interpretability (prototype layer). The focus on pediatric ICU data fits the call for minority/critical care applications. The methodology directly implements the research idea, and the problem statement is well-supported by the challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, outlining the problem, proposed solution (Clin-ACT with its three components), experimental design, and expected impact. Key concepts and formulas (NCE loss, active learning criterion, prototype similarity/saliency) are presented. Minor ambiguities exist: the exact nature of 'imputation-aware augmentations' beyond the examples given could be more specific, the source of probabilities p(c|W) for active learning isn't explicitly stated (presumably from a classifier using current embeddings), and the training details of the prototype module could be slightly elaborated. However, these do not significantly hinder understanding the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While contrastive learning, active learning, and prototype-based interpretability are existing techniques, their specific integration into a single framework (Clin-ACT) tailored for pediatric ICU time series with clinician-in-the-loop feedback is novel. The literature review confirms that prior works focus on subsets of these challenges (e.g., self-supervision for missing data, multi-modal contrastive learning) but not this specific combination addressing label efficiency, robustness, and interpretability simultaneously via active contrastive learning and prototypes. The uncertainty-diversity criterion applied to time series windows for active learning and the direct link between contrastive embeddings and interpretable prototypes are key novel aspects."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established methods: contrastive self-supervision (NCE loss), active learning strategies (uncertainty-diversity), and prototype-based interpretability. The rationale for choosing these components to address the specific challenges (label scarcity, interpretability) is logical. The mathematical formulations provided are standard and appear correct. Minor gaps include the lack of detail on specific 'imputation-aware' augmentations beyond examples and the precise mechanism for updating prototypes during training. The active learning criterion `U(W) = H(W) * D(W)` is plausible but might benefit from justification compared to alternatives. Overall, the methodological foundation is strong."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology (deep learning frameworks, standard algorithms). The methodology relies on known techniques. However, practical implementation faces challenges: obtaining access to sensitive pediatric ICU data with appropriate ethical approvals and privacy safeguards is often difficult. Securing dedicated clinician time for annotation (even if reduced by active learning) and participation in the satisfaction survey requires strong clinical collaboration. The computational cost of contrastive learning on potentially large time series datasets needs consideration. The ambitious targets (+12% accuracy, 60% label reduction) add risk, but the core research plan is implementable assuming data and collaboration are secured."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles critical, unmet needs in clinical time series analysis: reducing labeling burden, handling data imperfections, and building clinician trust through interpretability. Success would provide a valuable tool for leveraging sparse, complex data in high-stakes environments like pediatric ICUs. Improving sepsis prediction (+12% target) in children would have substantial clinical impact. The focus on label efficiency and interpretability makes the approach potentially actionable and adoptable in real-world clinical settings, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals. The methodology could generalize to other low-data, high-stakes medical domains."
