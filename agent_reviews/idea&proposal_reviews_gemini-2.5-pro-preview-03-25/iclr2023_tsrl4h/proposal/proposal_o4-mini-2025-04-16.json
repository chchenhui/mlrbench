    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the key challenges highlighted in the task description, such as label scarcity, missing/irregular data, high dimensionality, robustness, interpretability, and the focus on minority groups (pediatric ICU). The methodology systematically builds upon the research idea, detailing the proposed Clin-ACT framework. It also appropriately positions itself relative to the cited literature (STraTS, SLAC-Time, MM-NCL), aiming to extend these works by integrating active learning and prototype-based interpretability in a unified manner tailored for the specific clinical context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the three core components (Encoder, Active Learning, Interpretability) with specific technical formulations, algorithms, and justifications for design choices. The experimental design is thorough, specifying datasets, tasks, baselines, metrics, and implementation details. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, primarily through the synergistic integration of imputation-aware contrastive learning, hybrid active learning, and prototype-based interpretability specifically tailored for pediatric ICU time series. While the individual components (contrastive learning, active learning strategies, prototype methods) exist, their combination and adaptation (e.g., specific augmentations like mask perturbation, mask consistency loss, application of AL to contrastive embeddings in this context, integration of prototypes) constitute a novel approach for this specific problem domain. It clearly distinguishes itself from the cited works by adding the active learning and interpretability layers in a cohesive framework."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, active learning, prototype methods, Transformers). The proposed methodology is well-justified, with appropriate choices for handling irregular/missing data (continuous value embedding, mask consistency loss, specific augmentations) and achieving label efficiency (hybrid AL) and interpretability (prototypes, saliency). Technical formulations (loss functions, architecture details) are correctly presented. The experimental design is robust, including internal and external validation, relevant baselines, comprehensive metrics, and qualitative clinician feedback."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing ML techniques and frameworks (PyTorch, Transformers). Required data sources (internal PICU dataset, public dataset) are identified, and computational resources (A100 GPUs) are specified. The plan is realistic, outlining clear steps. The main potential challenge lies in securing consistent clinician time for the active learning loop (labeling 1000 windows) and evaluation survey (10 clinicians), which is a common bottleneck in clinical ML research but seems appropriately scoped within the proposal. The integration of multiple components adds complexity but is manageable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical unmet needs in pediatric critical care: robust analysis of complex time series, reducing the burden of manual labeling, and providing interpretable insights to foster clinician trust and adoption. By focusing on a high-risk, under-represented pediatric population, it aligns perfectly with the task description's call for work on minority data groups. Success would represent a substantial contribution to clinical decision support, potentially improving patient outcomes and accelerating the translation of advanced ML into pediatric healthcare."
