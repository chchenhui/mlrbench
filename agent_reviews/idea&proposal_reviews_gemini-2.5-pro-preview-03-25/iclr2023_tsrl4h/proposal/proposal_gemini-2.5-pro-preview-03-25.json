    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop (label scarcity, missing/irregular data, robustness, interpretability, minority data groups like pediatrics/ICU) mentioned in the task description. It faithfully expands the core concepts outlined in the research idea (imputation-aware contrastive SSL, active learning, prototype interpretability). Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to build upon the challenges and methods discussed in the literature review (e.g., handling missing data like STraTS/SLAC-Time, need for label efficiency, interpretability gap). The focus on pediatric ICU data perfectly matches the call for actionable research in specific clinical areas and minority groups."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to specific objectives, detailed methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes/impact. The research objectives are specific, measurable (with quantified targets like 60% label reduction, +12% AUROC/AUPRC improvement), achievable, relevant, and implicitly time-bound within a project scope. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the data, preprocessing steps, the three core components (SSL, AL, Interpretability) including architectural choices, loss functions, acquisition functions, and evaluation protocols. The language is precise and technical, making the proposal readily understandable to an expert audience."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the individual components (contrastive learning, active learning, prototype-based methods) exist, the novelty lies in their synergistic integration into a single framework (Clin-ACT) specifically tailored for the challenges of pediatric ICU time series. Key novel aspects include: 1) The 'imputation-aware' contrastive learning approach with specific augmentations designed to leverage, rather than simply handle, missingness and irregularity. 2) The combination of this tailored SSL with uncertainty-diversity active learning to optimize the use of limited clinician labels within this specific representation space. 3) The application of prototype-based methods not just for classification but as an explicit interpretability layer, aiming to provide clinically intuitive archetypes and saliency maps derived from the learned representations. This integrated approach distinguishes it from prior work focusing on SSL alone or standard AL techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in well-established ML principles (contrastive learning via InfoNCE, Transformer architectures for sequences, standard AL criteria like uncertainty/diversity, prototype networks). The methodological choices are well-justified: using Transformers for irregular time series (citing STraTS), designing augmentations based on data characteristics, combining uncertainty and diversity in AL, and using prototypes for interpretable clustering. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, appropriate metrics (AUROC/AUPRC for imbalanced data), cross-validation, robustness checks, and a plan for qualitative clinician validation of interpretability. Technical formulations (loss function, probability calculation) appear correct. Minor potential weaknesses include the challenge of tuning AL hyperparameters and the assumption that prototypes will neatly map to clinically distinct archetypes, but the overall approach is technically solid."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It plans to use a publicly available dataset (MIMIC-IV pediatric subset), mitigating data access issues. The proposed methods (Transformers, contrastive learning, active learning simulation, prototype layer) rely on existing techniques and architectures, implementable with standard ML libraries and compute resources (GPUs). Simulating AL avoids the real-world bottleneck of clinician labeling during development. The plan includes a small-scale (3-5 clinicians) qualitative study for interpretability, which is manageable. While ambitious (integrating three components, achieving high performance targets), the project scope seems realistic for a dedicated research effort. Potential risks include engineering complexity in integrating the components and achieving the specific quantitative improvement targets, but these do not render the project infeasible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and widely recognized challenges in applying ML to healthcare: the high cost and scarcity of expert labels, the need for models robust to noisy/incomplete real-world data, and the crucial requirement for interpretability to foster clinical trust and adoption. By focusing on pediatric critical care, it targets a high-stakes environment and an underserved patient population, aligning perfectly with the workshop's emphasis. Success would provide a practical framework for developing more accurate, label-efficient, and trustworthy clinical decision support tools, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes (e.g., via earlier sepsis detection). The methodological contributions (integrated SSL+AL+Interpretability framework, tailored augmentations, prototype explanations) would also advance the broader field of time series representation learning for health."
