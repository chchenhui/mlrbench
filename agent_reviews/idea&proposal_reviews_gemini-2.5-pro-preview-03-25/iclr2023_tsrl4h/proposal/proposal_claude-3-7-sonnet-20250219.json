    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: time series representation learning for health, challenges of labeling scarcity, missing/irregular data, high dimensionality, and the need for robustness and interpretability. It specifically targets a minority data group (pediatrics/ICU) as encouraged by the task description. The methodology clearly expands on the research idea, detailing the contrastive learning, active learning, and interpretability components. It positions itself well within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging similar works (e.g., self-supervision for missing data) while proposing novel extensions (clinically-informed augmentations, active learning integration, prototype layer with clinician feedback) to tackle the identified key challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the Clin-ACT framework, including specific architectural choices (Transformer encoder), novel augmentations (with formulas), the active learning criterion, and the prototype-based interpretability approach. The experimental design is thorough, outlining datasets, tasks, metrics, baselines, and a plan for clinical evaluation. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the proposal immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like contrastive learning, active learning, and prototype-based interpretability exist, their specific synthesis and application to pediatric ICU time series data are novel. Key innovative aspects include: 1) The design of clinically-informed augmentations (Missingness-Aware Masking, Clinical Range Preservation, importance-weighted Temporal Warping, Modality Dropout) tailored for pediatric data challenges. 2) The integration of active learning directly with the self-supervised representation learning loop to minimize clinician annotation burden specifically for time series windows. 3) The combination of a prototype layer with feature attribution and an explicit clinician refinement loop for interpretability. This integrated, clinician-in-the-loop approach distinguishes it from the cited literature which focuses more narrowly on self-supervision aspects or multi-modal learning without the active learning/clinician feedback loop for interpretability refinement."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, active learning principles, prototype methods, Transformers) and relevant prior work identified in the literature review. The proposed methodology is well-justified, with specific techniques chosen to address the challenges of clinical time series (e.g., Transformer for sequences, specialized augmentations for irregularity/missingness). The mathematical formulations for augmentations and the contrastive loss modification appear reasonable. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and includes appropriate metrics, baselines, and a crucial clinical validation component. Minor areas that could benefit from further elaboration include the precise mechanism for deriving the clinical importance score `c(t)` for temporal warping and ensuring the robustness of the prototype refinement process, but the overall technical approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. Accessing and using pediatric ICU data (both proprietary and MIMIC-IV) requires navigating IRB approvals and data use agreements, which can be time-consuming. The methodology involves integrating several complex components (SSL, AL, Interpretability), requiring significant engineering effort and expertise. Securing sufficient time from 10-15 pediatric intensivists for both annotation (even if reduced by AL) and the interpretability evaluation/refinement loop is a key dependency and potential bottleneck. Computational resources for training Transformer-based models with contrastive learning are needed. While the plan is generally realistic, successful execution depends heavily on securing data access and sustained clinical collaboration."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical, unmet needs in pediatric critical care AI: improving model performance with limited labeled data, handling complex real-world data characteristics, and enhancing model transparency and trust for clinical adoption. Success would lead to more label-efficient development of clinical decision support tools, potentially improving early detection of deterioration (like sepsis) in a vulnerable patient population. Methodologically, it advances time series representation learning by proposing a novel framework tailored to clinical data constraints. The focus on pediatrics addresses an underrepresented group, and the emphasis on interpretability aligns with the growing need for trustworthy AI in healthcare, directly matching the goals highlighted in the task description."
