    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses 'Time Series Representation Learning for Health', focuses explicitly on a key challenge mentioned ('dealing with missing values'), uses a representation learning approach (self-supervised contrastive learning), targets a specific application area encouraged by the workshop (ICU, pediatrics), and tackles high-dimensional multivariate data. It fits squarely within the workshop's scope and themes."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core problem (missing values in ICU time series), proposed method (self-supervised contrastive learning with transformers), and evaluation plan (MIMIC-IV/eICU, downstream tasks, pediatric focus) are well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise formulation of the 'novel contrastive learning objective' and how 'clinical domain constraints' are implemented as regularization terms, but the overall concept is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While self-supervised learning, contrastive methods, and transformers have been applied to time series, their specific combination for *imputation* in the challenging ICU context, coupled with a potentially novel contrastive objective (distinguishing true vs. synthetic continuations for imputation) and the integration of clinical domain constraints, offers a fresh perspective. The explicit focus on pediatric ICU data within this framework also adds to the novelty. It's not a completely new paradigm but a novel synthesis and application of existing concepts to a specific, difficult problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Required datasets (MIMIC-IV, eICU) are accessible, though requiring credentials and preprocessing. Transformer architectures and contrastive learning frameworks are well-established and implementable with standard ML libraries and GPU resources. Evaluating imputation quality and downstream task performance is standard. The main potential challenge lies in effectively defining and integrating physiologically plausible 'clinical domain constraints', which might require significant domain expertise, but it is conceptually feasible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Missing data is a critical bottleneck in leveraging ICU time series for clinical research and decision support. Developing robust imputation methods that preserve clinical validity and capture complex temporal dependencies could lead to major improvements in downstream tasks like mortality prediction or treatment effect estimation. The focus on representation learning adds value beyond just imputation. Addressing the specific challenges of pediatric ICU data further enhances its significance by targeting an under-studied population. Success would represent a meaningful contribution to both ML in healthcare and clinical practice."
