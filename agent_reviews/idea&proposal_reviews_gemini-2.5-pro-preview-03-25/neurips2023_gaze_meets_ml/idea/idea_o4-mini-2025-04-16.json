        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics of the workshop, including 'Annotation and ML supervision with eye-gaze', 'Unsupervised ML using eye gaze information for feature importance/selection', 'Attention mechanisms and their correlation with eye-gaze', and 'Eye gaze used for AI, e.g., Computer Vision'. The motivation explicitly mentions using gaze as a 'cost-efficient human supervision signal' to bridge 'human cognition and AI', which is the central theme of the workshop. The proposed method uses gaze data from egocentric video to guide representation learning, fitting well within the scope of gaze-assisted machine learning for perception tasks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main technical approach (contrastive learning using gaze fixations for positive/negative sampling, saliency-weighted loss), and evaluation plan are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The core mechanism of using temporal adjacency for positives and spatial distance for negatives based on gaze is immediately understandable. Minor details, such as the exact mathematical formulation of the saliency-weighted loss, could be further specified, but the overall concept is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While contrastive learning and the use of gaze data in ML are existing concepts, the specific proposal to integrate them in this manner – using gaze fixations to define positive (temporally adjacent fixations) and negative (spatially distant patches) pairs within a contrastive framework for self-supervised representation learning – is novel. The addition of a saliency-weighted contrastive loss further enhances the originality. It offers a fresh perspective compared to standard SSL methods that treat image regions uniformly or supervised methods requiring dense labels."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Contrastive learning frameworks (SimCLR, MoCo) are well-established. Processing gaze data (fixations, heatmaps) and image crops is standard. Datasets combining egocentric video and gaze exist (e.g., EPIC-KITCHENS annotations, Ego4D potentially, GTEA Gaze+), although availability at the desired scale or quality might require effort or specific data collection. Modifying loss functions and training Siamese networks are common practices in deep learning research. The main potential challenge lies in accessing or curating sufficient high-quality paired gaze-video data, but the core technical approach is practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the important limitation of standard SSL methods ignoring human visual saliency. By leveraging gaze, it promises to learn representations that are more aligned with human perception, potentially leading to improved performance on downstream tasks (especially in egocentric vision), better sample efficiency, and enhanced interpretability. Providing a method for cost-efficient weak supervision via gaze is highly relevant. Success could lead to meaningful contributions in representation learning, human-centric AI, and understanding the link between gaze patterns and semantic understanding."
