        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on gaze-assisted machine learning, bridging human cognition and AI, and using gaze for supervision, understanding attention mechanisms, improving interpretability, and applications like autonomous driving and radiology. GazeAlign directly addresses these points by proposing a method to align model attention with human gaze using eye-tracking data, explicitly aiming to improve interpretability and human-AI interaction in relevant application domains. It hits multiple key topics listed, such as 'Attention mechanisms and their correlation with eye-gaze', 'Annotation and ML supervision with eye-gaze', 'Eye gaze used for AI, e.g., Computer Vision, Explainable AI, Trustworthy AI', and 'Gaze applications in... radiology, autonomous cars'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main goal, and key components (dataset, contrastive learning, evaluation) are clearly presented. The distinction between simply using gaze as supervision versus modifying internal attention mechanisms to mimic gaze priorities is well-explained. However, specific details about the contrastive learning objective formulation or the exact modifications to the vision transformer attention mechanisms are not provided, leaving some minor ambiguities regarding the technical implementation. Overall, the concept is easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea has notable originality. While using gaze data in vision models or for saliency prediction isn't entirely new, GazeAlign proposes a specific framework focused on aligning the *internal attention mechanisms* of transformers with human gaze patterns using a *contrastive learning* approach, rather than just predicting saliency maps or using gaze as direct supervision for outputs. The emphasis on modifying the mechanism itself to mimic human gaze allocation priorities, aiming for more human-like visual reasoning paths alongside task performance, offers a fresh perspective compared to much existing work. It combines existing concepts (gaze data, attention, contrastive learning) in a potentially innovative way."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. The primary challenge lies in acquiring or accessing a 'large-scale dataset pairing images with human gaze heatmaps during various visual tasks'. Collecting such data is resource-intensive. While some public datasets exist, they might not cover the diversity of tasks or scale required. Designing the contrastive learning objective to effectively align attention without degrading task performance requires careful tuning. Modifying transformer attention mechanisms is technically possible but ensuring they genuinely mimic human gaze priorities is non-trivial. Evaluation metrics exist, but integrating alignment and task performance evaluation needs a well-defined protocol. Overall, it's feasible within a research context but requires significant effort, particularly regarding data."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the discrepancy between computational attention and human gaze targets a fundamental issue in AI interpretability and trustworthiness. Success could lead to vision models that are not only accurate but also make decisions based on visual evidence similar to humans, which is crucial for critical applications like medical diagnosis and autonomous navigation. This directly contributes to Explainable AI (XAI) and human-centered AI development, potentially fostering greater trust and facilitating better human-AI collaboration. The potential impact on safety-critical systems is substantial."
