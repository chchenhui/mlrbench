        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with all provided materials. It directly addresses the core themes of the 'Gaze Meets ML' workshop task description, such as using eye-gaze for ML supervision, correlating attention mechanisms with gaze, improving interpretability, and applications in radiology. It perfectly embodies the research idea by proposing a self-supervised framework using radiologists' gaze to prioritize features via regional contrastive learning. Furthermore, it accurately summarizes the provided literature review, positions its novelty relative to prior works (McGIP, FocusContrast, GazeGNN), and explicitly plans to address the key challenges identified (data availability, variability, integration, privacy, scalability)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, research gap, objectives, methodology (including the GazeCon framework, loss functions, data processing, and algorithmic steps), experimental design, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. Mathematical notation is used appropriately for the instance-level loss, and the novel regional loss is described in sufficient detail conceptually. Minor ambiguities might exist only in the finest implementation details (e.g., precise patch extraction method for regional loss), but the overall concept and plan are immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building upon existing self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks (like SimCLR) and prior work using gaze in medical AI (cited papers), the core idea of introducing a *regional* contrastive loss (\\mathcal{L}_{gaze}) guided by gaze density maps is novel. This differs significantly from instance-level gaze similarity (McGIP), gaze-guided augmentation (FocusContrast), or direct gaze sequence integration in GNNs (GazeGNN). The proposal clearly articulates this distinction and justifies the need for region-level guidance. The combination of instance-level and gaze-guided regional losses is also a novel contribution in this context."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations of self-supervised learning (contrastive methods) and the well-accepted premise that expert gaze correlates with regions of interest in medical images. The proposed methodology (GazeCon framework, loss functions, data processing) is robust and well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines, downstream tasks, evaluation metrics, interpretability analysis, and crucial ablation studies. Technical formulations are clearly presented and appear correct. The explicit plan to address challenges identified in the literature review further strengthens its soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Its reliance on publicly available datasets with gaze data (REFLACX) significantly reduces the data acquisition barrier. The core methodology uses standard deep learning architectures and builds upon existing SSL implementations, making the technical development manageable. The main implementation challenge lies in the novel regional contrastive loss component, but this appears achievable within standard frameworks. Potential risks related to gaze data variability and hyperparameter tuning are acknowledged. Assuming access to adequate computational resources (standard for SSL research), the project plan is realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical challenges in medical AI: the high cost of annotation for supervised learning and the need for more interpretable and trustworthy models. By leveraging gaze data as weak supervision to guide SSL, it has the potential to improve diagnostic model performance (especially in low-data regimes), reduce development costs, and enhance clinical acceptance by aligning AI attention with expert focus. The work also contributes a novel technique to the growing field of gaze-assisted machine learning, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals and potentially influencing SSL methodologies beyond medical imaging."
