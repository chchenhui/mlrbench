    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on gaze-assisted ML, specifically unsupervised learning using gaze for feature importance in radiology. The proposed GazeCL framework is a direct implementation of the research idea, leveraging radiologists' gaze for self-supervised contrastive learning. It appropriately cites and builds upon the provided literature (McGIP, FocusContrast, GazeGNN), positioning the work within the current research landscape and addressing relevant themes like annotation efficiency and human-AI alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. Key components like the model architecture, gaze heatmap generation, and the contrastive loss function are presented with specific formulas and clear explanations. The experimental design is detailed and easy to follow. While minor details like the exact implementation of the gaze proportionality in the attention layer could be slightly more explicit, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using gaze for contrastive learning in medical imaging exists (e.g., McGIP, FocusContrast), GazeCL introduces a novel mechanism. Specifically, it proposes contrasting gazed vs. non-gazed *patches within the same image* and integrates a *gaze-guided attention layer* directly into the ViT backbone to modulate embeddings *before* the contrastive head. This differs from McGIP (inter-image similarity) and FocusContrast (gaze-guided augmentation). The combination of intra-image gaze-based contrastive sampling and the specific attention mechanism offers a fresh perspective distinct from the cited prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (self-supervised contrastive learning, ViTs) and the plausible hypothesis that expert gaze indicates salient regions. The methodology is well-described, including data processing, model components, loss function, and a comprehensive experimental plan with appropriate baselines and metrics. Technical formulations are provided and appear largely correct. Minor points, such as the precise enforcement of gaze proportionality in the attention layer and the potential oversimplification of treating all non-gazed regions as equally negative, slightly detract from perfect soundness but do not represent major flaws."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces a significant potential challenge regarding data availability. While the technical implementation (ViT, contrastive learning, attention mechanisms) is feasible using standard tools, the core methodology relies heavily on the availability of large-scale, publicly available chest X-ray datasets *paired with corresponding radiologist gaze data*. As noted in the literature review's challenges, collecting such data is resource-intensive and its widespread availability for datasets like CheXpert or MIMIC-CXR might be limited. The proposal assumes this data exists but doesn't detail contingency plans if it's scarce or unavailable, which poses a considerable risk to successful execution. The computational requirements are also high but standard for this type of research."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical challenges in medical AI, namely the high cost of expert annotation and the need for more interpretable and trustworthy models. By leveraging gaze data as a form of weak supervision, it has the potential to significantly improve data efficiency for training diagnostic models. Aligning AI attention with radiologists' focus could enhance clinical acceptance and performance, particularly in low-data scenarios. Success would represent a substantial contribution to both medical imaging AI and the broader field of gaze-guided machine learning."
