    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (Workshop on Gaze Meets ML), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: using eye-gaze for ML supervision (specifically self-supervision), unsupervised feature learning, feature importance via attention, applications in radiology, and enhancing interpretability/trustworthy AI by bridging human cognition (gaze) and AI. It faithfully expands on the research idea of using gaze patterns for feature prioritization in medical imaging via contrastive learning. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (McGIP, FocusContrast, GazeGNN), positioning its contribution (continuous gaze prior via GGAM and GWCL) as an advancement over existing methods and acknowledging key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, motivation, and research objectives are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the proposed Gaze-Guided Attention Module (GGAM) and Gaze-Weighted Contrastive Loss (GWCL), including mathematical formulations, data sources, preprocessing steps, training protocol, and a comprehensive evaluation plan with specific metrics and ablation studies. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities might exist in implementation details (e.g., exact layer for GGAM injection), but the overall concept and plan are exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing work in self-supervised learning (SimCLR/MoCo) and gaze-guided learning (McGIP, FocusContrast, GazeGNN), it introduces distinct contributions. Specifically, the proposed GGAM integrates gaze as a *continuous* attention prior to dynamically weight patch embeddings within the backbone, and the GWCL uses gaze similarity to *weight* the contribution of patch pairs within the contrastive loss. This differs from prior work cited, which primarily used gaze for selecting positive pairs (McGIP) or guiding data augmentation (FocusContrast). The combination of these two gaze-informed mechanisms for feature learning presents a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of self-supervised contrastive learning and the well-accepted premise that expert gaze correlates with regions of interest in medical images. The proposed GGAM and GWCL mechanisms are technically plausible and mathematically formulated. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant downstream tasks, interpretability metrics, ablation studies, and comparisons to strong baselines. The use of standard datasets and evaluation protocols adds to the rigor. Minor weaknesses include the reliance on the quality of generated gaze heatmaps and the need for empirical validation of the specific gating and weighting formulations proposed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Leveraging existing large datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert) and gaze data (McGIP) is practical. However, the plan to collect significant new eye-tracking data (25k sessions) requires substantial effort, resources (radiologists' time, eye-trackers), and potentially ethical approvals, representing a key feasibility risk. The proposed methods (GGAM, GWCL) are implementable with standard ML libraries but require expertise. Pre-training on large datasets necessitates significant computational resources (GPUs). The 12-month timeline is ambitious given the data collection but appears generally realistic for the technical work."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of reducing annotation dependency in medical AI by leveraging readily available (though requiring collection) expert gaze data. Success would lead to more data-efficient and potentially better-performing unsupervised models for medical image analysis. Crucially, it aims to improve model interpretability by aligning AI attention with expert gaze, fostering clinical trust and adoption. The potential to outperform existing SSL methods and reduce the need for labeled data has substantial practical implications. The methodology could also generalize to other domains, enhancing its overall significance."
