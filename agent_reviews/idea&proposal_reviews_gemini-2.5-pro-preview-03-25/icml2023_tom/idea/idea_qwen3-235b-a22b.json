        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (Workshop on Theory of Mind in Communicating Agents). It directly addresses the workshop's main theme of computational modeling of ToM, particularly focusing on its role in natural language processing (NLP) models like transformers. It explicitly falls under the listed topic 'Leveraging ToM for Machine Learning Applications (e.g., NLP)' and strongly relates to 'model explainability' and 'human value alignment', which are mentioned as key areas of interest in the workshop motivation. The proposal aims to improve NLP models using ToM, which is central to the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main technical approach (dual-channel model, ToM supervision, regularization, explanation generation), and evaluation strategy are described logically. The example provided ('I detected aggression...') helps illustrate the intended output. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the 'cognitive science frameworks' for annotation, the exact nature of the regularization, and the mechanism for 'posterior ToM reasoning', but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While research on ToM in AI and explainable AI (XAI) exists, the specific proposal to integrate explicit ToM supervision (predicting latent mental states) into a dual-channel transformer architecture for the *primary purpose* of generating human-like explanations based on inferred mental states is a novel combination. It moves beyond simply using ToM for task improvement towards using it as a core mechanism for interpretability, offering a fresh perspective compared to standard XAI techniques or implicit ToM modeling."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning data annotation. Annotating datasets with reliable latent mental state labels (beliefs, desires) is inherently difficult, subjective, potentially expensive (if using crowdsourcing), and requires careful framework design (if using cognitive science theories). This data acquisition step is critical and represents a major bottleneck. The modeling aspect (dual-channel transformers, joint training, regularization) is technically feasible with current ML practices, but the success heavily depends on the quality and scale of the annotated data."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of opacity in complex NLP models. Generating explanations grounded in Theory of Mind could lead to more intuitive, trustworthy, and human-aligned AI systems. This is particularly important for high-stakes domains like healthcare and education, as mentioned. Success would represent a meaningful contribution to XAI, human-AI interaction, and the broader goal of developing more responsible AI systems, aligning well with the workshop's interest in positive social impact and value alignment."
