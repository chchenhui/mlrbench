    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of computational modeling of ToM in communicating agents, focusing on leveraging ToM for ML applications (NLP/dialogue) and Human-AI collaboration. It faithfully expands on the core concepts presented in the research idea (meta-learning, MAML, ToM module, few-shot adaptation, synthetic data, evaluation). Furthermore, it explicitly references key papers from the literature review (Sclar et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Johnson & Lee, 2024) and directly tackles challenges identified therein, such as data annotation complexity (via synthetic data) and evaluation standards (by proposing a comprehensive evaluation plan)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Impact). Key concepts like ToM, meta-learning, MAML, and the proposed architecture are explained. The methodology, including data generation, model components, meta-learning steps, integration, and evaluation, is detailed systematically. Mathematical notation is used to formalize parts of the approach. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of the adaptation loss (\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\\\\\text{adapt}) and the alignment loss (\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\\\\\text{alignment}), and the specifics of the semi-automated annotation verification process could be elaborated further. However, the overall objectives, methods, and rationale are understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing a specific framework (Meta-ToM) that integrates a structured neural ToM module (dual-encoder, explicit mental states B, K, G, I) with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for the specific purpose of *few-shot user adaptation* in conversational AI. While the literature review indicates prior work exists on meta-learning for personalization (Johnson & Lee, 2024) and even MAML for ToM in dialogue (Purple & Orange, 2023), this proposal details a specific architectural and integration strategy that appears distinct. The novelty lies in this synthesis and application focus, particularly the emphasis on rapid adaptation (3-5 turns) via MAML applied to an explicit ToM module, rather than general personalization or end-to-end ToM modeling. The distinction from the closest prior works could be slightly sharper, but it offers a fresh perspective on achieving adaptive ToM."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (ToM from cognitive science) and well-established machine learning techniques (Transformers, MAML). The proposed methodology is generally robust: synthetic data generation with LLMs and human verification is a pragmatic approach to the data challenge, the dual-encoder ToM architecture is plausible, MAML is appropriate for the few-shot adaptation goal, and the evaluation plan is comprehensive (benchmarks, simulation, human studies, ablations). Technical formulations are mostly correct, although specific definitions for some loss functions (\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\\\\\text{ToM}, \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\\\\\text{adapt}, \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\\\\\text{alignment}) are missing, and the additive belief update mechanism might be simplistic. The reliance on synthetic data quality is a potential weakness, but the plan includes verification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. The required technologies (LLMs, Transformers, MAML) are available. However, generating a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality synthetic dialogue corpus with accurate latent mental state annotations is a significant undertaking, even with semi-automation and human verification. Training the complex integrated system and performing meta-learning will require substantial computational resources. The planned human evaluation study (100 participants) is resource-intensive but standard. The primary risk lies in the quality and ecological validity of the synthetic data, which directly impacts the effectiveness of the learned ToM module and its adaptation capabilities in real-world scenarios. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable for a well-equipped research group."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in conversational AI: the lack of adaptive Theory of Mind. Enabling agents to rapidly model and adapt to individual users' mental states (beliefs, goals, knowledge) has the potential for major impact. Success would lead to more personalized, efficient, empathetic, and trustworthy human-AI interaction, advancing HCI significantly. It also contributes a computational model relevant to cognitive science and provides a framework for integrating meta-learning with structured cognitive modeling in AI. The potential applications in areas like education, healthcare, and collaboration are substantial. The research tackles fundamental challenges in AI alignment and social AI development."
