        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes (ToM for ML/NLP, HCI, Social Impact, Cognitive Foundations) and the core motivation of the research idea (few-shot ToM adaptation using meta-learning). It effectively integrates concepts and challenges highlighted in the literature review, citing relevant papers (MindDial, Hypothetical Minds, SymbolicToM, MAML for ToM) and explicitly tackling identified challenges like data annotation (via synthetic data) and evaluation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed, the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of data generation, model architecture (including specific components like GNN, RNN, LLM, MAML), and training procedures with relevant technical formulations. The experimental design specifies metrics, benchmarks, and baselines. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While leveraging existing concepts like MAML for adaptation and explicit ToM modules (acknowledged by citing refs [6, 8, 10]), the novelty lies in the specific synthesis: integrating a GNN+RNN based ToM module with an LLM via MAML for *few-shot* user adaptation in conversational AI, trained initially on a specifically designed synthetic dataset using knowledge graphs and diverse agent policies. It clearly differentiates itself from prior work like MindDial (static) and Hypothetical Minds (multi-agent focus). The proposed framework represents a novel combination and application of existing techniques to address the specific challenge of rapid ToM personalization."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (ToM, meta-learning, GNNs, LLMs) and established methods (MAML). The methodology, including synthetic data generation, model architecture, and training procedure, is well-reasoned and technically plausible. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, incorporating multiple benchmark types and user studies. Minor weaknesses include the inherent challenge of ensuring synthetic data fully captures real-world nuances and the relatively brief description of the RL integration mechanism. The technical formulations provided are appropriate."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. It requires significant expertise across multiple ML domains (dialogue, GNNs, MAML, RL) and substantial computational resources. The proposed synthetic data generation pipeline is complex but implementable. Integrating the various components (GNN, RNN, LLM, MAML, RL) presents technical challenges. Achieving high accuracy (>90\\%) with very few (O(10)) interactions is a challenging goal. User studies add complexity regarding resources and ethics. Overall, it's feasible for a well-equipped research team but carries moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical limitation in current conversational AI â€“ the lack of dynamic, personalized ToM. Success would represent a major advancement in human-AI interaction, leading to more empathetic, efficient, and trustworthy systems. The potential impact spans HCI, NLP applications (especially in sensitive areas like mental health and education), and foundational AI research on social intelligence. The explicit consideration of ethical implications further enhances its significance."
