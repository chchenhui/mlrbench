    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (focusing on ToM modeling in agents, HCI, and ML applications), the research idea (directly implementing the Meta-Theory concept using meta-learning for few-shot ToM adaptation), and the literature review (citing relevant works like SymbolicToM, ToMi benchmark, and papers on meta-learning for ToM, while addressing identified challenges like generalization and evaluation). It coherently integrates all provided context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Research objectives are explicit. The methodology section provides detailed steps for data collection, model architecture (ToM-Encoder), meta-learning algorithm (MAML with equations), deployment strategy (joint optimization), and a thorough experimental design (baselines, metrics, user studies). The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the plan readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal combines established concepts (Meta-Learning, MAML, ToM modeling in dialogue). However, the literature review provided includes very recent papers (specifically 6, 8, and 10) that appear to explore highly similar ideas: meta-learning for personalized ToM, few-shot ToM adaptation, and MAML for ToM in dialogue systems. While the specific implementation (synthetic data strategy, joint optimization details, evaluation setup) might offer some novelty, the core concept of applying meta-learning for few-shot ToM adaptation seems less original in light of this specific literature context. The proposal doesn't sufficiently distinguish its core contribution from these closely related works."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, based on solid ML foundations (Transformers, MAML) and relevant cognitive concepts (ToM). The methodology for pretraining and meta-learning is well-described and standard. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including multiple metrics and relevant baselines. However, potential weaknesses exist: reliance on synthetic data generation (potential for bias, annotation brittleness despite validation) and the 'Joint Optimization During Deployment' section lacks detail on the online fine-tuning mechanism, potential stability issues, and how exactly loss is computed and applied during interaction."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using current ML techniques. Implementing the models and MAML is standard. However, generating and validating 100k high-quality synthetic dialogues across 10 domains is ambitious and resource-intensive. Conducting user studies with 100 participants also requires significant logistical effort and funding. Assuming access to substantial computational resources, LLM APIs, crowdsourcing platforms, and user study infrastructure, the project is achievable, albeit challenging."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in conversational AI: the lack of rapid, personalized adaptation based on users' mental states (ToM). Enabling few-shot adaptation tackles a key scalability challenge. Success would lead to more effective and empathetic AI systems in important domains like healthcare, education, and collaboration, representing a meaningful advancement in human-AI interaction. The public release of data and code would also be a valuable contribution."
