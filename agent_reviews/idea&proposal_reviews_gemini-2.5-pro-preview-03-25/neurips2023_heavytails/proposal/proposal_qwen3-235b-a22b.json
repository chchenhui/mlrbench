        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of reframing heavy tails from a 'dreaded' phenomenon to a potentially beneficial and expected characteristic in ML. The core idea (HTGA) perfectly matches the research idea provided. The methodology and expected outcomes explicitly connect to topics mentioned in the task description (stochastic optimization, generalization, stability, dynamical systems, scaling laws) and build upon the challenges and findings presented in the literature review (e.g., limitations of clipping/normalization, need for better understanding of generalization, stability bounds)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from motivation and background to the specific methodology (HTGA framework, algorithm steps, experimental design), expected outcomes, and future work. The objectives are clearly stated. The HTGA framework components are described, and the algorithm steps are outlined. Mathematical notation is used, although the Hill estimator formula appears to have a minor typo (missing index `j` in the second log term), slightly impacting perfect clarity. Some details, like the exact form of the scaling function `lambda(alpha)` or the adaptive thresholding mechanism, are left open, which is acceptable for a proposal but prevents a perfect score. Overall, the proposal is well-articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. The core concept of Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification (HTGA) – actively *amplifying* gradients based on their estimated tail index to enhance exploration – presents a fresh perspective compared to prevailing methods discussed in the literature review, which primarily focus on mitigating heavy tails through normalization (Paper 2), clipping (Paper 4), or truncation/quantization (Paper 5). While building on the emerging understanding that heavy tails can be beneficial and using existing tools like the Hill estimator, the proposed *mechanism* of adaptive amplification is innovative. The real-time, block-wise estimation of the tail index within the optimization loop also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has gaps in rigor. It is well-grounded in empirical observations (heavy tails exist) and relevant literature. However, the core HTGA mechanism relies on heuristics. The choice of the Hill estimator for real-time, non-stationary gradient data needs strong justification regarding robustness and computational cost, which is acknowledged but not fully addressed. The proposed amplification function (`lambda(alpha)`) lacks strong theoretical justification *a priori* for why it should improve convergence or generalization, although deriving this is part of the proposed work. The crucial aspect of ensuring stability via adaptive thresholding is mentioned but not detailed, which is a significant point for soundness as amplification could easily lead to divergence. The potential typo in the Hill estimator formula also slightly detracts from technical correctness. The experimental plan is sound, but the core algorithmic proposal needs stronger theoretical backing or preliminary evidence of stability."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Implementing the HTGA algorithm involves estimating the tail index (computationally intensive but likely manageable with techniques like block-wise estimation or focusing on specific layers/parameters) and applying a scaling factor, which are technically achievable with current ML frameworks. The experimental plan uses standard datasets and evaluation protocols. Access to compute resources (GPUs) is standard. The main risks involve the computational overhead of tail estimation and potential instability of the amplification mechanism, but the proposal acknowledges the need for stability controls (thresholding). The theoretical analysis is ambitious but aligns with active research areas. Overall, the project seems implementable with moderate refinement and careful engineering."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely research question: how to understand and utilize the ubiquitous heavy-tailed phenomena in deep learning optimization. By proposing to actively leverage heavy tails for improved exploration and generalization, it challenges conventional wisdom and aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of repositioning heavy tails as potentially beneficial. Success could lead to novel, more effective optimization algorithms, particularly for complex non-convex landscapes or low-data regimes. Furthermore, the research promises deeper theoretical insights into optimization dynamics, generalization, and connections to dynamical systems and scaling laws, contributing substantially to the fields highlighted in the task description."
