    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's goal of repositioning the understanding of heavy tails from a negative phenomenon to a potentially beneficial one. It implements the core research idea of leveraging (and adaptively amplifying) heavy-tailed gradients for generalization. It situates itself correctly within the provided literature, acknowledging existing work on analysis (Raj et al., 2023; Dupuis & Viallard, 2023) and mitigation (Hübler et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2025; Armacki et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2024) while proposing a novel approach that goes beyond them, directly tackling the challenges and themes (optimization dynamics, generalization, stability) mentioned."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the tail index estimation, the adaptive amplification mechanism (including specific formulas for the transformation and adaptive exponent), the overall AHTGA algorithm (with pseudo-code), and a comprehensive experimental plan. The rationale is clearly articulated, and the structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities might exist only at the level of fine-grained implementation details or hyperparameter choices, but the core concepts and procedures are exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon the established observation of heavy-tailed gradients in deep learning, the core idea of *adaptively amplifying* these gradients based on estimated tail index and training phase is novel. This contrasts significantly with existing approaches cited in the literature review, which primarily focus on analyzing the phenomenon or mitigating its perceived negative effects (e.g., clipping, normalization). The specific gradient transformation function and the dynamic scheduling of the target tail index are original contributions. It's not entirely groundbreaking (as it builds on existing observations), but it offers a fresh and potentially impactful perspective on optimization."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in recent literature identifying heavy tails in SGD. The methodology employs established techniques like the Hill estimator (with appropriate refinements like adaptive k selection and smoothing) and integrates the novel mechanism into a standard momentum-based optimizer. The mathematical formulations for the transformation and adaptive exponent are clearly presented. However, the theoretical justification for the specific form of the transformation function and the adaptive schedule for the target tail index (\\alpha^*) is currently heuristic, relying on intuition about exploration/exploitation phases. While the proposal includes plans for theoretical analysis (convergence, generalization bounds), these are presented as future work and are known to be challenging for such adaptive, non-standard optimizers. The core mechanism is plausible but requires the proposed empirical and theoretical validation to be fully confirmed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The components (tail index estimation using Hill estimator, gradient transformation involving norms and basic operations, integration into SGD) are computationally implementable on standard deep learning hardware (GPUs). The use of standard benchmarks and models facilitates empirical validation. Potential challenges include the computational overhead of tail index estimation within the training loop (especially adaptive k selection), potential sensitivity to new hyperparameters (c_1, c_2, \\alpha^* schedule parameters), and the inherent difficulty of the planned theoretical analysis. However, these are manageable research risks, and the overall experimental plan seems realistic."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of deep learning optimization, generalization theory, and the role of heavy-tailed dynamics – a central theme highlighted in the task description. If successful, the proposed AHTGA framework could represent a paradigm shift from mitigating heavy tails to actively leveraging them, potentially leading to substantial improvements in model generalization, robustness, and data efficiency. The research could also yield significant theoretical insights into the mechanisms underlying deep learning success, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theory. The potential impact spans algorithmic development, theoretical understanding, and practical applications."
