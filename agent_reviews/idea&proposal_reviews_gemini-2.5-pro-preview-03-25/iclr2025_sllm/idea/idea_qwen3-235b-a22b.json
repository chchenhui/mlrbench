        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned: Mixture of Experts (MoEs), Quantization, Activation Sparsity (inherent in MoEs), Hardware Innovation for Sparsity (by targeting deployment efficiency), and LLM inference. Furthermore, it explicitly aims to find synergies between sparsity (MoE structure and activation) and quantization, which perfectly matches the workshop's goal of fostering connections between related research areas to unlock innovation in AI systems efficiency and design."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly defines the problem (deploying quantized MoEs effectively), the proposed solution ('code-conditional quantization' based on routing context/importance), the mechanism (learnable meta-controller, co-optimization), and the expected outcomes (quantified improvements). Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact architecture of the meta-controller or the specifics of the co-optimization process, but the core concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While MoEs and quantization are established fields, the core novelty lies in proposing a *dynamic, context-aware* quantization strategy specifically tailored to the sparse activation patterns of MoEs. Conditioning the quantization bit-width on the routing decision ('code') and functional importance, learned via a meta-controller and co-optimized with the router, represents a fresh perspective compared to static or globally adaptive quantization methods. It cleverly links the dynamic routing inherent in MoEs to the quantization policy."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The components (MoEs, quantization techniques like differentiable rounding, meta-learning) exist. However, integrating these elements and successfully co-optimizing the expert weights, the routing function, and the quantization policy controller simultaneously will require significant engineering effort and computational resources. Training stability and achieving the target performance might require careful tuning and experimentation. It's feasible within a research context but not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. MoE architectures are crucial for scaling state-of-the-art LLMs, but their large size poses deployment challenges. Efficiently quantizing MoEs without significant performance degradation is a critical problem. This research directly addresses the need for better algorithm-hardware co-design for sparse models, potentially enabling the deployment of powerful MoE models on resource-constrained platforms (edge AI, mobile devices). Success would represent a major advancement in efficient AI."
