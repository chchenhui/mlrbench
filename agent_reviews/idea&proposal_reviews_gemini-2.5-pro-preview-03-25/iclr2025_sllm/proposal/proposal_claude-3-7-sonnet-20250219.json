        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of MoE, quantization, hardware-aware optimization, and inference efficiency, which are central to the task description. The methodology closely follows the research idea, elaborating on dynamic mixed-precision quantization, RL-based optimization, and hardware awareness. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself against recent relevant works identified in the literature review (MiLo, MC-MoE, MoQa) and aims to tackle the key challenges highlighted, such as accuracy degradation and adaptive bit-width allocation. The focus on bridging MoE sparsity with adaptive quantization perfectly matches the workshop's goal of exploring synergies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and outlines the proposed solution. The methodology section is well-structured, breaking down the approach into logical components (Expert Importance Analysis, Mixed-Precision Framework, RL for Bit-Width Selection, QAT). Mathematical formulations are provided for key concepts, enhancing precision. The experimental design is detailed and comprehensive, specifying models, datasets, baselines, metrics, and hardware platforms. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. While some implementation details could be further specified (e.g., RL network specifics), the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While mixed-precision quantization for MoEs exists (e.g., MC-MoE, MoQa), the core novelty lies in the proposed method for achieving it: using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for *dynamic*, hardware-aware optimization of bit-widths per expert. This contrasts with existing methods like MC-MoE's static LP formulation. The integration of hardware-in-the-loop training for the RL policy, the specific formulation of the Expert Importance Score (EIS), and the combination of QAT with expert specialization techniques further contribute to the novelty. It offers a fresh perspective by framing bit-width selection as an adaptive control problem solved via RL, distinguishing it clearly from prior work cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in MoE architectures, quantization techniques, RL (PPO), and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT). The proposed methodology, including the expert importance metrics, quantization formulas, RL state/action/reward structure, and QAT modifications, is technically plausible and well-justified. The mathematical formulations are presented clearly and appear correct. The experimental design is rigorous, featuring relevant baselines (including SOTA methods), comprehensive metrics, multiple hardware targets, and planned ablation studies. Minor areas for further justification might include the specific weighting of EIS components and the robustness of the RL reward function, but the overall approach is well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges and resource requirements. Implementing and training large MoE models, conducting extensive RL training (especially with a hardware-in-the-loop component across multiple platforms), and integrating specialized QAT requires substantial computational resources and engineering effort. Access to the specified hardware (A100, T4, CPUs, mobile chipsets) is crucial. The complexity of tuning the RL agent and ensuring stable convergence adds risk. While the individual components are based on existing technologies, their integration is complex. The ambitious performance targets (2-3x speedup, 40% memory reduction) might be challenging to fully realize. However, the plan is logical and achievable with sufficient resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical bottleneck of inference efficiency for large MoE models, a major barrier to their wider adoption. Successfully achieving the stated goals (significant speedup and memory reduction with minimal accuracy loss) would represent a major advancement, enabling the deployment of powerful MoE models on resource-constrained hardware like edge devices and reducing the operational costs and environmental impact of LLM inference. The research directly contributes to the fields of efficient deep learning, model compression, and hardware-aware AI, aligning perfectly with the workshop's themes. The potential for democratization of LLMs and enabling new edge AI applications underscores its high significance."
