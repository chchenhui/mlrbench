    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the task (MoEs, quantization, hardware interaction, inference efficiency) and the specific research idea (dynamic mixed-precision using RL with hardware feedback). It effectively synthesizes the literature review, identifies gaps (limitations of static/heuristic methods, lack of direct hardware feedback integration), and positions the proposed work as a logical advancement addressing key challenges highlighted in the review (accuracy degradation, adaptive allocation, hardware efficiency, balancing compression/performance)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The background, problem statement, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow, and key concepts like the RL formulation (state, action, reward), quantization scheme, and QAT integration are explained clearly. There is minimal ambiguity, making the research plan immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality and innovation. While mixed-precision quantization and RL for optimization exist, the specific application of an RL agent trained with direct hardware performance feedback (latency, energy) to dynamically determine per-expert bit-widths in MoE models is a novel approach. This distinguishes it from prior MoE quantization works cited (MoQE, MiLo, MC-MoE, MoQa) which primarily rely on static quantization, post-hoc compensators, heuristics, or LP-based allocation without the same level of dynamic, hardware-aware, learning-based optimization during the policy design phase. The proposed co-design involving QAT and the RL policy is also a sophisticated integration."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (MoEs, quantization principles, RL algorithms like PPO, QAT). The methodology is well-reasoned, proposing a clear RL framework and a comprehensive experimental plan including relevant baselines (SOTA MoE quantization methods), metrics, and ablation studies. The inclusion of different options for hardware feedback (models, simulators, direct measurement) adds robustness. Minor potential weaknesses involve the complexity of RL training for potentially large state spaces and the accuracy of hardware models if direct measurement proves too slow, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The required components (MoE models, datasets, compute for RL/QAT, quantization libraries, hardware access/models) are standard in well-resourced ML labs. However, training the RL agent, especially with hardware-in-the-loop feedback, could be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Achieving the ambitious target of <1% accuracy drop alongside significant efficiency gains (2-3x latency, 40% memory) requires careful execution and tuning. Reproducing some specific baselines might also pose challenges if code is unavailable. Overall, it's achievable but requires significant effort and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of deploying large, powerful MoE models efficiently, which is a major bottleneck for both cloud and edge applications. Success would lead to substantial practical benefits, including reduced inference latency and cost, lower energy consumption (sustainability), and wider accessibility of advanced AI. It directly contributes to the workshop's themes by exploring the synergy between sparsity (MoEs), quantization, and hardware, potentially advancing the state-of-the-art in model compression and efficient AI systems."
