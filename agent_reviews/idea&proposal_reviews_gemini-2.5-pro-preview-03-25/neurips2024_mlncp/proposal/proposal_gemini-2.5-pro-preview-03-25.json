    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for ML co-design with new compute paradigms (analog hardware), focuses on exploiting hardware characteristics rather than just mitigating them, and specifically targets Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) as suggested. The methodology incorporates concepts from the cited literature (PAT, hybrid gradients, analog challenges) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified (noise, precision, training). It faithfully expands the core research idea into a detailed plan. A minor point could be slightly more elaboration on the specific relationship/differentiation from Nest & Ernoult's gradient computation, but overall consistency is very high."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The background, problem statement, and objectives are articulated precisely. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the proposed hybrid architecture, the physics-informed proxy, the training algorithm adaptation, and the evaluation plan. Key concepts are explained well, and the structure is logical and easy to follow. There is minimal ambiguity in the description of the proposed system and experiments."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While it builds upon existing concepts like DEQs, analog computing, and Physics-Aware Training (PAT), the core contribution lies in the specific synthesis: leveraging analog dynamics *natively* for DEQ fixed-point computation and developing a tailored physics-informed training strategy using implicit differentiation through a hardware-aware proxy. This specific combination and adaptation for DEQs, moving beyond general physical system training (PAT) or EBM-focused hybrid gradients (Nest & Ernoult), represents a novel approach to hardware-algorithm co-design for this class of models. The novelty is clearly articulated in relation to prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established theories (DEQs, dynamical systems, implicit differentiation) and relevant prior work (PAT, analog computing principles). The proposed methodology, particularly the use of a differentiable proxy to handle hardware non-idealities during training, is a recognized and sensible approach. The adaptation of implicit differentiation for the proxy model is conceptually sound, although its practical stability and convergence properties will require careful implementation and analysis. The assumptions (e.g., existence of suitable analog mappings, adequacy of the proxy) are reasonable for a research proposal. Technical formulations are presented correctly."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible, especially given its initial focus on simulation. Simulating analog circuit dynamics (using SPICE or numerical models) and implementing DEQs with custom training loops (using standard ML frameworks) are achievable tasks. Developing the differentiable proxy is a software engineering challenge well within research capabilities. The required expertise (ML, DEQs, analog modeling) is specialized but available. The main risks involve the complexity of finding good analog mappings, ensuring proxy fidelity, potential training instabilities, and the computational cost of scaling simulations, but these are typical research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks to the proposed simulation-based investigation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical and timely problem of the AI compute wall and the need for energy-efficient AI, aligning perfectly with the goals of sustainable AI development. Successfully enabling complex models like DEQs on energy-efficient analog hardware could represent a step-change in performance for certain applications (edge AI, real-time control) and significantly advance the field of analog machine learning by providing a concrete co-design and training methodology. It directly tackles key challenges highlighted in recent surveys (Datar & Saha, 2024) and has strong potential for scientific, technological, and potentially societal impact."
