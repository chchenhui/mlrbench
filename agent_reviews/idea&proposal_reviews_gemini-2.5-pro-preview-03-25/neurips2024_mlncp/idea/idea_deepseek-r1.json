        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the need for co-designing ML models (EBMs) with non-traditional hardware (analog stochastic hardware). It explicitly proposes exploiting inherent hardware characteristics (noise, mismatch) rather than just mitigating them, which is a key point in the task description. It targets a model class (EBMs) mentioned as limited by compute resources and aims for efficiency gains, fitting the workshop's goals of exploring new compute paradigms for ML."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (EBM sampling inefficiency, analog hardware potential) is concisely stated. The main proposal (co-design framework, using hardware noise for Gibbs sampling, hybrid training) is clearly articulated. The expected outcomes (latency/energy reduction, robust EBMs) are specific. There are no significant ambiguities in the core concept."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using analog hardware for computation or accelerating ML isn't entirely new, the specific focus on co-designing EBMs with analog hardware to *exploit* its inherent stochasticity for Gibbs sampling is innovative. The proposed hybrid training loop, adapting the model to the hardware's noise profile, represents a fresh perspective compared to simply trying to build noise-resilient analog accelerators. It combines existing concepts (EBMs, analog computing, hardware-in-the-loop) in a novel way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Designing analog circuits that reliably leverage thermal noise for controlled Gibbs sampling is complex. Integrating this analog hardware into a hybrid training loop with digital components, managing the analog-digital interface, compensating for limited precision, and calibrating the system pose considerable technical hurdles. While conceptually plausible, realizing the proposed system and achieving the targeted 10-100x speedup requires substantial engineering effort and potentially breakthroughs in analog circuit design and control. Access to specialized hardware fabrication and testing facilities is also necessary."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. EBMs are a powerful class of models whose practical application is severely limited by sampling costs. Providing a hardware-accelerated, energy-efficient sampling method could unlock their potential for various applications (generative modeling, anomaly detection, scientific ML). Furthermore, demonstrating how to *productively use* the perceived imperfections (noise, variability) of analog hardware for computation would be a major advancement in the field of alternative computing paradigms for AI, directly addressing the sustainability and efficiency challenges highlighted in the task description."
