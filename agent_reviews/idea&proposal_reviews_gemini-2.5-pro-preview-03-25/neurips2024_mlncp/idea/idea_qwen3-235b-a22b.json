        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. It directly addresses the need for exploring non-traditional computing paradigms (analog hardware), focuses on co-designing ML models (DEQs) with hardware, explicitly aims to tackle hardware limitations (noise, precision) using a physics-aware approach, and targets model classes (DEQs) mentioned as being limited by current compute resources. It fits squarely within the workshop's goals of fostering synergy between ML and alternative hardware for efficiency and sustainability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is very clearly articulated. The motivation, core concept (hybrid analog-digital DEQ, physics-aware proxy), and expected outcomes are well-defined and easy to understand. The distinction between the roles of analog (convergence) and digital (parameterization) components is clear. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact implementation details of the 'physics-aware differentiable proxy', but the overall research direction is crystal clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While DEQs and analog ML hardware are existing concepts, the specific proposal to co-design DEQs where the analog hardware *natively implements* the equilibrium-finding dynamics is innovative. Furthermore, using a physics-informed differentiable proxy specifically tailored to simulate and mitigate analog imperfections during DEQ training represents a fresh approach to robust hardware-aware ML. It combines known elements in a synergistic and non-obvious way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea faces significant feasibility challenges. Implementing stable and controllable analog circuits that reliably converge to the fixed points of arbitrary DEQs is technically demanding due to noise, device mismatch, and limited precision. Developing an accurate yet differentiable physics-aware proxy for these complex analog dynamics is also non-trivial. Training DEQs can be sensitive, and adding simulated hardware noise/limitations could exacerbate stability issues. Success requires deep expertise across ML, analog design, and potentially physics modeling, making implementation considerably challenging, though not necessarily impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and impact potential. It addresses the critical challenge of energy efficiency and computational bottlenecks in ML, particularly for powerful but demanding models like DEQs. If successful, enabling efficient analog execution of DEQs could unlock their use in resource-constrained environments (edge AI, robotics) and real-time applications (control systems). The co-design methodology and the approach to handling hardware imperfections could offer valuable insights for the broader field of ML on non-traditional hardware, potentially leading to major advancements in sustainable AI."
