    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on understanding representation similarity and its practical application in model merging/stitching. The core TCFA concept is precisely the one outlined in the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle the key challenges (architectural disparities, task variability, alignment complexity, efficiency, generalization) identified in the literature review and positions itself relative to the cited works. It successfully integrates the motivation, idea, and context provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-structured and clearly articulates the background, objectives, significance, and evaluation plan. The core idea of task-conditioned functional alignment using OT/CCA is understandable. However, a significant lack of clarity exists in the 'Algorithmic Steps' section regarding the integration of the learned transformations (T_i,j,l^k) into the final merged model (M). The provided formula `M(X) = sum_{i,j} T_{i,j,l}^k(f_l(X))` is ambiguous and likely overly simplistic. It doesn't explain how transformations from different layers, conditions, or model pairs are combined to form a single cohesive architecture. This crucial detail about the 'stitching' mechanism requires substantial clarification, impacting the overall clarity of the proposed methodology."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers good novelty. While functional alignment and techniques like OT/CCA for comparing representations are established (as acknowledged by referencing stitching literature), the specific idea of *conditioning* the functional alignment on downstream task properties to merge models with *heterogeneous architectures and task distributions* appears innovative. It moves beyond simple parameter averaging or direct activation matching by introducing task context into the alignment process itself. The focus on deriving lightweight 'stitching' layers from this conditional alignment process distinguishes it from prior work mentioned, which focuses more on theoretical understanding, alignment during training, or specific model types (diffusion models)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound theoretical concepts like representation alignment, functional similarity, Optimal Transport, and Canonical Correlation Analysis. The general methodology of probing activations, finding transformations, and merging is logical. However, the soundness is significantly weakened by the unclear and potentially incorrect mathematical formulation for integrating the stitching layers, as mentioned under Clarity. Without a rigorous description of how the layer-wise, task-conditioned transformations (T_i,j,l^k) are composed to create the final merged model M, the technical soundness of this critical step is questionable. The reliance on the assumption that such task-conditioned alignment is sufficient for effective merging across diverse architectures also requires empirical validation, though it is a plausible hypothesis to investigate."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible. Accessing pre-trained models and datasets for probing is standard practice. Implementing OT and CCA variants is achievable with existing libraries. The computational cost of alignment might be considerable for large models but likely manageable within a research context. The main feasibility challenge lies in operationalizing the 'task-conditioning' effectively (selecting appropriate conditions/variations) and, more critically, designing and implementing the mechanism for integrating the learned transformations into a functional merged model (the unclear step). While challenging, these aspects seem addressable with further refinement and standard ML engineering effort, making the overall project feasible, albeit with moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research proposal addresses a significant problem in machine learning: the efficient merging and reuse of pre-trained models, particularly those with differing architectures or training data. Success would offer substantial practical benefits, reducing computational costs and potentially improving model performance through synergistic merging. Furthermore, the research aligns with the broader goals of understanding representation learning, identifying invariances, and contributing to AI alignment by investigating the relationship between function, structure, and data, as highlighted in the task description and literature review. The potential impact on model development practices and fundamental understanding is high."
