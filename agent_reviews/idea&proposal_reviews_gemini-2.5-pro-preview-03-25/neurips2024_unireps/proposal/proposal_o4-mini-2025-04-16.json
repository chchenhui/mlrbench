    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on understanding representation similarity and unification by proposing a specific mechanism (TCFA) for merging models. The research idea is faithfully translated into a detailed methodology. The proposal explicitly tackles challenges identified in the literature review, such as architectural disparities and task distribution variability, by design (cross-architecture merging, task-conditioning). The objectives and expected impact resonate strongly with the workshop's themes of practical applications (merging, reuse) and theoretical understanding (representation alignment, invariances)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step description of the TCFA framework, including specific techniques (OT, CCA) with their mathematical formulations and a clear plan for stitching layer construction and fine-tuning. The experimental design is thorough, specifying datasets, architectures, baselines, metrics, and ablations. The language is precise and technical, making the proposal readily understandable to experts in the field. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While model merging, activation space alignment, OT, and CCA are existing concepts, the core idea of *Task-Conditioned* Functional Alignment (TCFA) appears novel. Specifically, the strategy of computing alignment transformations conditioned on specific task properties (classes, styles) to handle both architectural heterogeneity and slight task distribution shifts simultaneously is a fresh perspective. This approach is distinct from standard global alignment or stitching methods mentioned in the literature review and directly addresses a gap in merging techniques for diverse models and tasks."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established and mathematically sound techniques like Optimal Transport (OT) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) for comparing distributions and finding correlations in activation spaces. The overall methodology (probing, aligning, stitching, fine-tuning) is logical and follows standard practices in representation learning research. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (naive averaging, random permutation) and evaluation metrics (accuracy, CKA, overhead). Minor weaknesses include the potential computational cost of OT (though mitigated by entropic regularization/Sinkhorn) and the ambitious nature of the theoretical characterization objective, which might be hard to fully realize. However, the core empirical approach is well-justified and technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required computational resources (GPUs), datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet subset), and software libraries (for OT, CCA, deep learning frameworks) are standard and accessible. The technical steps, while requiring expertise, are implementable. The experimental plan is detailed and realistic for a research project. Potential risks include the possibility that the alignment quality might not be sufficient for high-performance merging across very different architectures or tasks, or that fine-tuning the stitching layers might still require significant computation, but these are research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues. The empirical validation is clearly achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and practical problem of reusing pre-trained models efficiently, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous architectures and task variations â€“ a common challenge in real-world ML deployment, continual learning, and federated learning. Success would lead to substantial practical benefits (reduced computational cost, energy savings, increased modularity). Furthermore, the research has the potential to yield valuable theoretical insights into the nature of neural representations, functional alignment, and the conditions under which different models learn similar structures, directly contributing to the core questions posed by the workshop task description."
