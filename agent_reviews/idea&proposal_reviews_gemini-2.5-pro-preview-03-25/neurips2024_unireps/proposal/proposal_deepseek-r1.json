    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core questions about *when, how, and why* representations align by proposing the TCFA mechanism. It faithfully implements the research idea, detailing task conditioning, OT alignment, and stitching layers for cross-architecture merging. Furthermore, it effectively integrates concepts from the literature review, citing relevant papers ([1], [2], [4]), using proposed metrics (CKA from [2]), aiming to validate hypotheses (CRH from [2]), and explicitly tackling the identified key challenges (architectural disparity, task variability, functional alignment complexity, efficiency)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The TCFA framework is broken down into understandable phases with specific techniques (CKA, OT, Sinkhorn, stitching loss) mentioned. The experimental design, including baselines and metrics, is clearly outlined. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving minimal room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like model merging, stitching [1], representation similarity (CKA [2]), and Optimal Transport exist, the core idea of Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment (TCFA) – specifically using task variations (style, class permutations, corruptions) to probe and align activation spaces functionally across different architectures using Optimal Transport – represents a novel combination and approach. It distinguishes itself from simple parameter averaging or standard stitching by incorporating task-specific functional probes and sophisticated alignment techniques like OT for potentially non-linear mappings between activation spaces of diverse models."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations like representation similarity analysis (CKA [2]) and Optimal Transport theory. The methodology is logical, employing established techniques (CKA, OT, linear stitching layers) in a novel context. The technical formulations provided (CKA, OT objective) are standard and appear correct. The rationale for using task conditioning and OT is well-justified for tackling cross-architecture functional alignment. Minor uncertainties might exist regarding the optimal choice of OT cost function or the precise design of task conditioning probes, but the overall approach is methodologically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on publicly available datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet, LAION) and pre-trained models, along with standard deep learning frameworks and algorithms (OT solvers, CKA computation). The required computational resources are significant but typical for this type of research. The experimental plan is well-defined. Potential challenges include the computational cost of OT, the need for careful tuning of task conditions and alignment hyperparameters, and ensuring the stability of the OT optimization. However, these challenges appear manageable within a research setting, making the proposal practical and implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and practical challenge of merging neural models across different architectures and task distributions, which has direct implications for computational efficiency (reducing redundant training), model reuse (modularity), and federated learning. Theoretically, it aims to deepen the understanding of representation alignment, potentially validating/extending the Canonical Representation Hypothesis [2] and contributing to AI alignment science [4]. Successful execution could lead to substantial advancements in building more efficient, modular, and potentially interpretable AI systems."
