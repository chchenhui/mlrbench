    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Unifying Representations in Neural Models' by proposing a methodology for aligning representations across different models and modalities. It explicitly targets practical applications mentioned in the task description, such as model merging/reuse and multi-modal scenarios, and touches upon understanding universal features (interpretability). The motivation also echoes the workshop's interest in bridging AI and neuroscience perspectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation, main idea (including specific steps like extraction, alignment, validation), expected outcomes, and potential impact are logically structured and easy to understand. It specifies potential techniques (autoencoders, transformers, CNNs for extraction; contrastive learning, MI maximization for alignment), which adds clarity. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise definition or scope of 'unification' versus 'alignment', but the overall proposal is very clear."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While representation alignment, multi-modal embeddings, contrastive learning, and mutual information maximization are existing concepts and techniques, the proposal synthesizes these elements into a specific framework aimed at *unifying* representations across potentially diverse models and modalities, not just within a single multi-modal task. It's more of a novel application and combination of existing tools focused on the specific unification problem highlighted by the workshop, rather than introducing a fundamentally new technique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. The proposed methods – extracting embeddings from standard neural networks, applying alignment techniques like contrastive learning, and using common validation metrics – rely on established techniques and readily available tools (e.g., deep learning libraries). Access to pre-trained models and datasets is generally possible. Potential challenges might involve optimizing the alignment process for very diverse models or tasks and rigorously evaluating the quality of 'unification', but the core technical approach is practical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact, aligning well with the importance stressed in the task description. Successfully unifying representations could lead to tangible benefits like improved model interoperability (merging, reuse), more effective multi-modal systems, and better interpretability by identifying shared features across models. These outcomes address important challenges in current ML research and could foster advancements in AI and potentially contribute insights relevant to neuroscience, as mentioned in the motivation."
