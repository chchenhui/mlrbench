        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses the core themes of the workshop task description. It investigates 'when' and 'how' different models learn similar representations by focusing on functional alignment conditioned on task properties. It explicitly targets a key practical application mentioned: model merging and unifying representations ('stitching'). The focus on functional similarity despite architectural differences aligns perfectly with understanding shared representations across distinct neural models."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It defines the problem (merging diverse models), proposes a specific approach (Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment using activation spaces), mentions potential methods (probing, OT/CCA), and states the goal (lightweight stitching layers). While specific implementation details (e.g., exact probing strategy, precise OT/CCA formulation for this context) could be further elaborated, the core concept and methodology are understandable with only minor ambiguities."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While model merging and representation alignment (including functional alignment via activations) are existing research areas, the specific focus on *task-conditioning* as the basis for alignment, particularly for merging *cross-architecture* models, presents a fresh perspective. It combines existing tools (OT, CCA) in a specific, task-aware manner to address limitations in current merging techniques. It's not groundbreakingly new in all its components, but the synthesis and specific application context provide good novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach appears largely feasible using current ML techniques. Probing models, extracting activations, and applying methods like Optimal Transport or CCA variants are established practices. However, applying these alignment methods to potentially high-dimensional activation spaces across multiple layers and task conditions could pose computational challenges (scalability). Designing and training the 'stitching' layers is also feasible but requires careful engineering. Access to diverse pre-trained models and suitable datasets is necessary but generally achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a significant problem in practical ML: efficiently reusing and combining pre-trained models, especially when they differ in architecture or training nuances. Success could lead to substantial computational savings and more flexible model deployment. Furthermore, understanding how functional alignment varies with task conditions could provide valuable insights into the nature of learned representations and the conditions under which universality emerges, contributing directly to the workshop's goals beyond just the practical application."
