        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The MCRA idea aligns excellently with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of unifying representations in neural models, focusing on *how* different models might learn similar representations (shared invariances) and providing a method to align them. It explicitly targets practical applications mentioned in the task, such as model merging/stitching and identifying universally highlighted features (invariances). The motivation connects well with understanding emergent abstractions, fitting the workshop's goal.",
        "score_explanation": "9-10 - Excellent: The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It addresses all aspects of the task and is highly relevant."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation, the two-stage pipeline (extraction/projection, contrastive optimization with sparsity), and the expected outcomes (quantitative alignment scores, stitching performance, invariant subspaces) are clearly defined and easy to understand. The use of established concepts like contrastive loss and activation mapping makes the proposal readily comprehensible.",
        "score_explanation": "9-10 - Excellent: The idea is crystal clear, perfectly defined, and immediately understandable. It is articulated concisely with no ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While representation alignment itself is not new (e.g., CKA, SVCCA), and contrastive learning is a known technique, the specific application of learnable mapping networks optimized via a contrastive loss specifically for aligning hidden states of *heterogeneous pre-trained* models appears innovative. Adding a sparsity penalty to explicitly identify shared salient features further enhances the novelty. It's a novel combination and refinement of existing techniques tailored to this specific cross-architecture alignment problem.",
        "score_explanation": "7-8 - Good: The idea has notable originality and innovation. It offers fresh perspectives or new combinations of existing concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The MCRA proposal is highly feasible. The core components – extracting activations from pre-trained models, implementing relatively small mapping networks (e.g., MLPs), using standard contrastive loss functions, and adding sparsity regularization – are all well-established and readily implementable using current deep learning frameworks. It doesn't require exotic computational resources beyond what's standard for training moderately sized networks, assuming access to the pre-trained models.",
        "score_explanation": "9-10 - Excellent: The idea is highly practical and implementable with current resources, technology, and knowledge. Execution is straightforward."

        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Successfully aligning representations across diverse architectures like ResNet/ViT or BERT/GPT would be a valuable contribution, enabling better model merging, transfer learning, and potentially ensemble methods. Furthermore, identifying the 'universally salient features' could provide fundamental insights into what different architectures learn and generalize, contributing to the broader understanding of neural representations, which is a key goal outlined in the task description.",
        "score_explanation": "7-8 - Good: The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses an important issue and could lead to meaningful contributions."
