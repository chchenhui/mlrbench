    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description (System-2 Reasoning at Scale workshop), the research idea (Self-Supervised Framework for Emergent System-2 Capabilities), and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key questions regarding the need for System-2 capabilities, the role of scale vs. specific mechanisms, where such mechanisms should be implemented (proposing an implicit, internal approach), and how to benchmark them (using procedural benchmarks to avoid contamination). It effectively synthesizes concepts from the literature review (S2A, Dualformer, self-supervision, contrastive learning, curriculum learning, meta-learning, procedural benchmarks) and positions the proposed work clearly within that context, explicitly referencing relevant papers."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and easy to follow. The background, objectives, significance, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The core concepts (Reflection Layers, multi-faceted self-supervised training) are explained in detail, including specific mechanisms, loss functions (with mathematical formulations), and data generation strategies. The experimental design, including baselines, datasets, metrics, and ablation studies, is thoroughly described. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise internal architecture of the Reflection Layers, but this is acceptable as an area for exploration within the research itself."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. The core novel contribution is the concept of 'Reflection Layers' integrated *within* the transformer architecture to perform meta-cognitive self-evaluation during the forward pass, aiming for *inherent* reasoning capabilities. This contrasts with external context regeneration (S2A) or explicit mode switching (Dualformer). While it draws inspiration from meta-learning and uses known techniques like contrastive and curriculum learning (citing relevant recent work), the specific combination of the architectural modification (Reflection Layers) and the tailored multi-objective self-supervised training strategy focused on emergent, internal reasoning represents a fresh approach. The novelty is clearly articulated and distinguished from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (System-1/System-2, meta-cognition) and established ML methods (Transformers, attention, self-supervision, contrastive loss). The proposed Reflection Layer mechanism, while novel, leverages standard attention principles. The multi-objective self-supervised learning strategy is well-reasoned, combining complementary signals (task performance, consistency via contrastive loss, rule adherence, reflection layer training). The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including crucial procedural benchmarks and ablation studies. Potential challenges like tuning multiple losses or generating diverse flawed traces are acknowledged implicitly but do not undermine the overall soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but presents significant engineering and experimental challenges. Implementing and integrating Reflection Layers and the complex multi-objective loss function requires considerable effort. Training large transformer models (especially ~1B parameters mentioned) demands substantial computational resources. Procedurally generating high-quality reasoning data, especially diverse flawed traces for contrastive learning and rule-checking for the rule adherence loss, could be complex. Tuning the hyperparameters for the combined loss and the curriculum learning schedule will likely require extensive experimentation. While ambitious, the plan is generally realistic, assuming access to adequate compute and ML expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current AI models â€“ the lack of robust, verifiable System-2 reasoning. Successfully developing inherent reasoning capabilities, as proposed, would be a major advancement, potentially leading to more reliable, trustworthy, and capable AI systems suitable for high-stakes applications (science, math, safety-critical domains). It directly tackles fundamental questions about AI development (scale vs. mechanism) and contributes to AI safety by focusing on logical consistency. The research could inform future architectural designs and evaluation methodologies, aligning perfectly with the workshop's themes."
