    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop (achieving System-2 reasoning, emergent vs. engineered mechanisms, benchmarking, contamination control). It faithfully elaborates on the research idea, detailing the Reflection Layers and the self-supervised training framework. Furthermore, it effectively integrates concepts and baselines (S2A, Dualformer, self-supervision, contrastive learning, RL, curriculum learning, procedural benchmarks) discussed in the literature review, positioning the proposed work within the current research landscape and addressing key challenges identified."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology (architecture, training, data, experiments), and expected outcomes are articulated logically. Key concepts like the Reflection Layer and the composite loss are explained with mathematical formulations. The structure is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for calculating the RL reward based on 'deducible rules' and the exact nature of the 'symbolic representations' in the generated data, but these do not significantly impede overall understanding."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. The core novelty lies in the proposed 'Reflection Layer' â€“ an internal, trainable module designed for self-evaluation and correction of reasoning steps within the transformer architecture itself, trained via a specific combination of self-supervised losses (consistency, contrastive) alongside LM and RL objectives. While it leverages existing techniques (contrastive learning, RL, curriculum learning), the specific architectural integration and the self-supervised approach to emergent internal reflection appear distinct from prior work like S2A (context regeneration) or Dualformer (explicit modes), offering a fresh perspective on achieving System-2 capabilities."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established principles (System-1/2 distinction, self-supervision, contrastive learning, RL, curriculum learning). The proposed architecture (Reflection Layer) and feedback mechanism (logit modification) are plausible. The chosen loss functions are appropriate for their respective tasks. The plan for procedural data generation with contamination control is methodologically sound, as are the evaluation metrics and ablation studies. Potential challenges, like tuning the composite loss and defining the RL reward precisely, are acknowledged implicitly but the overall technical approach is well-founded and formulations appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but requires significant resources and careful implementation. The stated computational requirement (64 A100s, 100B tokens) is substantial, indicating a need for major infrastructure access. Technically, implementing the Reflection Layer, the composite loss, and the procedural data generator is complex but achievable using standard frameworks. The main risks involve potential training instability due to the complex loss function, the difficulty in effectively implementing and tuning the RL component, and ensuring the Reflection Layer learns meaningful signals. Assuming resource availability, the plan is generally realistic."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of robust System-2 reasoning in current LLMs. This is a critical bottleneck for AI safety, reliability, and the deployment of AI in high-stakes domains. Successfully demonstrating emergent reasoning through an internal self-correction mechanism would be a major advancement. The potential impact includes more trustworthy AI, new architectural paradigms for reasoning, and improved benchmarking standards through the proposed procedural suite. The research directly tackles a central challenge in the field."
