    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme of System-2 reasoning in neural networks. It directly addresses several key questions posed in the task description: what is needed for System-2 capabilities (proposing Reflection Layers and specific training methods), whether it requires a new mechanism or emerges from training (proposing an emergent approach via architecture/training), where it should be implemented (arguing for implicit implementation within the model), and how to benchmark it while avoiding contamination (proposing novel benchmarks and protocols). It also implicitly tackles the necessity of System-2 and the limitations of scaling alone, aligning perfectly with the workshop's focus."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, overall goal (inherent System-2 reasoning), and the proposed training methodologies (curriculum, contrastive, rewards) are understandable. However, the central architectural component, 'Reflection Layers,' lacks specific detail. How these layers function mechanistically to enable self-evaluation, inconsistency identification, and refinement is not fully explained, leaving some ambiguity about the core technical innovation. Minor refinements clarifying the workings of these layers would significantly improve precision."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like self-supervision, curriculum learning, and contrastive learning for reasoning have been explored, the core proposal of integrating 'Reflection Layers' directly into the transformer architecture for meta-learning and iterative self-refinement of reasoning steps is innovative. This contrasts with common approaches relying on external modules, prompting strategies, or separate verifier models. Focusing on fostering *inherent* System-2 capabilities through this integrated mechanism offers a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility is somewhat uncertain, primarily due to the proposed 'Reflection Layers.' Designing, implementing, and training such layers within a transformer architecture could pose significant technical challenges regarding computational overhead, training stability, and architectural integration. While the proposed training techniques (self-supervision, curriculum, contrastive, rewards) and benchmark creation are generally feasible, the success hinges on the practical realization of the core architectural modification, which requires considerable research and engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. It targets a fundamental limitation of current AI models – robust System-2 reasoning – which is critical for advancing AI capabilities in complex problem-solving, ensuring reliability, and enhancing AI safety. Developing inherent reasoning abilities, as proposed, could lead to more dependable and trustworthy AI systems compared to those relying solely on external scaffolding. Success in this area would represent a major advancement with broad impact across various AI applications."
