        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of System-2 reasoning in language models, particularly transformers. It proposes a specific mechanism (hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture) to imbue LMs with these capabilities, explicitly tackling questions about needing new mechanisms versus emergence, integrating neural networks with symbolic reasoning, developing new architectures, and benchmarking System-2 generalization using synthetic data to avoid contamination. It positions itself as an alternative to relying solely on scale and offers a concrete approach to enhancing reasoning, safety, and interpretability, all key topics mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main components (LM generating symbolic representations, external symbolic engine, RL training with feedback), example application (math problems), evaluation strategy (compositional tasks, synthetic data), and expected outcomes (OOD generalization, interpretability) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The core mechanism of interaction between the neural and symbolic components is immediately understandable. Minor details about specific symbolic engines or RL reward shaping could be further specified, but the overall research direction is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches are an established research area, the specific proposal of using a transformer LM to generate intermediate symbolic representations that are then processed and verified by an external symbolic engine, with the LM being trained via RL based on feedback from this engine, offers a fresh perspective within the context of modern large language models. It differs from simply using LMs as controllers for external tools by emphasizing the generation of verifiable symbolic reasoning steps and using feedback to improve the LM's internal reasoning process. It's a novel combination and application of existing concepts tailored to address System-2 limitations in LMs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. Transformer models, symbolic solvers/provers, and RL frameworks are available. However, training an LM to reliably generate syntactically correct and semantically meaningful symbolic representations is non-trivial. Designing an effective RL reward signal based on feedback from the symbolic engine requires careful engineering. Ensuring efficient interaction between the LM and the symbolic engine, especially at scale, could be complex. Creating suitable synthetic benchmarks for compositional generalization also requires effort. While challenging, these hurdles seem surmountable with dedicated research and engineering, making the idea feasible but not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It targets a fundamental limitation of current LMs â€“ their weakness in robust, rule-based System-2 reasoning. Successfully implementing this approach could lead to major advancements in AI reliability, particularly in domains requiring logical, mathematical, or structured reasoning. The potential benefits include improved out-of-distribution generalization, enhanced interpretability through symbolic reasoning traces (crucial for AI safety and trust), and reduced reliance on brittle memorization. Bridging the gap between neural flexibility and symbolic rigor in a scalable manner addresses a critical challenge in AI research with potentially transformative impact."
