        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses several key questions and topics outlined in the workshop task description. Specifically, it focuses on 'How do we benchmark System-2-like generalization?' and 'How do we avoid data contamination?'. It also implicitly relates to distinguishing memorization from rule-based learning, syntactic generalization, and compositionality by proposing a benchmark designed to test these aspects rigorously. The plan to compare different models and training strategies also touches upon whether different mechanisms or training methods are needed for System-2 reasoning. The alignment is excellent."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented very clearly. The motivation outlines the problem (contamination, lack of compositionality in benchmarks) effectively. The main idea (grammar-based synthesis, strict train/test separation via atomic components vs. novel combinations, evaluation metrics) is well-defined and understandable. The initial scope (comparing transformer variants and training methods) is also specified. There are no significant ambiguities, making the proposal easy to grasp."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While procedural generation and grammar-based dataset creation are not entirely new concepts in ML, the specific application to create a benchmark for System-2 reasoning with an explicit focus on *strict* train/test separation based on compositional elements (atomic vs. combined) to prevent contamination *by design* offers notable originality. The combination of grammar-guided generation, contamination prevention, and evaluation metrics like attention-path consistency for reasoning tasks represents a fresh and valuable approach within the specific context of System-2 evaluation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposed idea is highly feasible. Defining formal grammars for domains like arithmetic or logic is achievable. Procedural generation of datasets based on these grammars is computationally tractable. Training and evaluating transformer models are standard practices. While ensuring perfect separation and designing appropriate grammars requires careful engineering, the core technical components rely on existing methods and technologies. No major roadblocks suggest impracticality."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a critical and widely acknowledged problem in the evaluation of large models: distinguishing true reasoning and generalization from memorization or exploitation of dataset artifacts. Data contamination is a major confounder. Providing a benchmark methodology that systematically controls for compositionality and prevents contamination by design would be highly impactful. It could lead to more reliable evaluations, guide the development of models with better systematic generalization (a key aspect of System-2 reasoning), and significantly advance the field's understanding."
