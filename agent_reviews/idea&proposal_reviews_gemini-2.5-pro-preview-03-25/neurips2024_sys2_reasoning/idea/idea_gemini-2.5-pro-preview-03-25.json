    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme of System-2 reasoning at scale. It directly addresses the question of 'What do we need to imbue language models with System-2 reasoning capabilities?' by proposing a specific mechanism (self-correction via verification calls). It also tackles the question of 'Do we need a different mechanism... or should it emerge...?' by proposing a specific, engineered mechanism involving an auxiliary objective and external tool integration. Furthermore, it touches upon 'Where should a system like this be implemented?' by suggesting a hybrid approach where an internal confidence score triggers explicit external calls. The focus on improving reasoning chains and integrating verification aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals of enhancing reasoning, integrating neural/symbolic elements (if tools are symbolic), and developing new approaches beyond just scaling."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (addressing plausible but incorrect reasoning, cost of full verification) is well-defined. The core mechanism (auxiliary objective for confidence prediction, threshold-based triggering of external verification tools, feedback loop) is explained clearly and logically. The goal (efficient self-correction, improved accuracy/trustworthiness) is explicitly stated. The components involved (LLM, confidence score, external tools/verifier) are identifiable. While implementation details would require further specification, the overall concept is immediately understandable and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While concepts like self-correction, using external tools (Toolformer, ReAct), and confidence estimation exist in LLM research, this proposal combines them in a specific and interesting way. The core novelty lies in training the LLM to *internally predict the correctness of its own intermediate reasoning steps* and using this *internal signal* to *selectively and dynamically* invoke external verification during the reasoning process itself. This contrasts with approaches that verify only the final output, always use tools, or rely solely on prompting for self-critique. It offers a potentially more integrated and efficient mechanism for targeted self-correction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate challenges. Training an LLM with an auxiliary objective is standard. Integrating external API calls for tools/verification is technically achievable. The main hurdles are: 1) Data Acquisition: Obtaining or generating reliable ground-truth data for intermediate reasoning steps and their correctness labels at scale can be difficult and costly. Using a separate verifier model introduces its own complexities and potential inaccuracies. 2) Calibration: Effectively training the confidence prediction module and tuning the threshold for triggering verification will require careful experimentation to balance accuracy gains against computational overhead. 3) Tool Integration: Ensuring seamless integration and effective use of the feedback from diverse external tools requires robust engineering. Overall, it's feasible with current ML techniques but requires significant effort in data curation/generation and system tuning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and impact potential. Improving the reliability and factual accuracy of LLM reasoning is a critical challenge (System-2 reasoning). Current models often fail subtly on complex tasks. A mechanism that allows models to efficiently identify potential errors in their reasoning chains and proactively seek verification could lead to major advancements in trustworthiness and performance on tasks requiring multi-step deduction, planning, or quantitative reasoning. Success would make LLMs more suitable for high-stakes applications and directly contribute to achieving more robust AI reasoning, a central goal in the field and highly relevant to the workshop's focus."
