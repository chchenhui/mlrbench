    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The ANSRR idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme of System-2 reasoning in neural networks. It directly addresses key topics such as integrating neural networks with symbolic reasoning, proposing a new mechanism (the router) for System-2 capabilities, enhancing systematic decision-making for AI safety (via interpretable logs), and considering benchmarking with contamination controls. It implicitly engages with the 'bitter lesson' debate by proposing a hybrid approach rather than relying solely on scale, and it addresses the question of whether System-2 mechanisms should be explicit (the router) or implicit."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated. The motivation outlines the problem (limitations of pure neural/symbolic approaches), and the main idea describes the proposed solution (trainable router dispatching tasks) and its components (transformer, router, symbolic engine). The training method (RL) and evaluation strategy (math/logic datasets, contamination control) are specified. While implementation details (e.g., exact router architecture, specific symbolic engine capabilities, RL reward structure) are not fully elaborated, the core concept is well-defined and understandable for a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While neural-symbolic integration and modular approaches (like routing) exist, ANSRR proposes a specific, trainable mechanism (the reasoning router) dynamically allocating sub-problems within a transformer's generation process based on the nature of the reasoning step. Training this router via RL with a reward incorporating symbolic tractability adds another layer of originality. It's a novel synthesis and application of existing concepts tailored specifically to enhancing System-2 reasoning within large models, rather than a completely new paradigm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Building upon standard transformers is practical. Integrating a lightweight symbolic engine is achievable. However, training the reasoning router effectively via RL could be complex, requiring careful design of the state/action space and reward function. Reliably classifying reasoning steps during generation might also be difficult. Ensuring seamless and efficient communication between the neural and symbolic components requires careful engineering. The proposed benchmarking is standard but requires rigorous execution regarding contamination control."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Addressing the limitations of current models in systematic, multi-step reasoning is a critical challenge in AI. Success could lead to more reliable and robust models for tasks requiring logical deduction, mathematical reasoning, and planning. The emphasis on interpretability through symbolic steps directly contributes to AI safety research. If ANSRR demonstrates improved compositional generalization and reduced hallucinations, it would be a meaningful contribution towards achieving more human-like System-2 reasoning capabilities in AI."
