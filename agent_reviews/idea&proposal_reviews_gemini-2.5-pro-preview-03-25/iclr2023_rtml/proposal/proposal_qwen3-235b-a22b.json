        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for methods enhancing trustworthiness (privacy, bias, toxicity mitigation) in large-scale models, specifically focusing on machine unlearning and efficient fine-tuning. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the integration of PEFT and gradient influence for scalable unlearning. Furthermore, it situates the work effectively within the provided literature, referencing relevant prior work (PEFT for unlearning, gradient-based methods) and aiming to tackle identified challenges like efficiency, utility preservation, and formal guarantees."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, significance, and experimental design are presented logically and are easy to understand. The core methodology combining gradient influence and PEFT is explained, and the pseudocode provides a high-level overview. However, some technical details could be slightly clearer, such as the precise mechanism for 'ensuring gradients from D_bad dominate theta_LoRA' during PEFT training, and the exact nature of the 'Utility Restoration' step (which parts of the model are fine-tuned). Despite these minor points needing refinement, the overall proposal is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the literature review shows existing work combining PEFT with unlearning (e.g., Fast-NTK, S3T, LMEraser) and using gradient-based methods (e.g., SalUn), this proposal's specific approach of using gradient tracing to identify influential parameters and then isolating/removing these influences via LoRA modules appears to be a distinct combination. The focus on achieving scalability (<5% overhead) and providing formal differential unlearning guarantees specifically for this LoRA-based gradient-guided approach adds to its novelty. It's an innovative synthesis rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has areas needing further justification. It builds on established concepts (gradient influence, PEFT, differential unlearning). However, the methodological step of ensuring specific data influences are captured predominantly by LoRA modules during initial training lacks a clear mechanism description. Additionally, the utility restoration step needs clarification regarding which parameters are tuned. The claim of achieving tight epsilon-differential unlearning bounds based solely on low-rank structure in the non-convex LLM setting requires rigorous theoretical proof, which is acknowledged but not provided. While the overall direction is plausible, these specific points weaken the current methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required computational resources (LLMs, GPUs) and software tools (PEFT libraries, DL frameworks) are standard for contemporary LLM research. The proposed algorithmic steps, including gradient estimation (with approximations like k-NN) and LoRA manipulation, are implementable. The experimental plan uses relevant datasets and metrics. However, achieving all ambitious targets simultaneously (e.g., <5% overhead, >90% toxicity reduction, <1% PII recall, >95% utility retention, *and* formal epsilon=0.5 guarantees) presents significant research challenges and potential trade-offs, making it good but not excellent in feasibility without demonstrating preliminary results."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical problem of efficiently removing harmful or unwanted data influences (bias, toxicity, private information) from large language models, which is essential for building trustworthy AI systems and complying with regulations like GDPR. Success would offer substantial benefits: cost savings compared to retraining, improved model safety and fairness, and increased user trust. The planned contributions, including a scalable algorithm, formal guarantees, a benchmark, and an open-source toolkit, would provide considerable value to both industry and the research community."
