        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the HAIC 2025 workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of Human-AI Coevolution (HAIC), focusing on feedback loops, continuous coadaptation, and long-term interactions. It explicitly aims to move 'beyond AI performance benchmarks' (a key focus of the workshop) by proposing a new evaluation framework. The idea touches upon multiple subject areas listed in the call, including 'Human-AI Interaction and Alignment' (trust, alignment drift), 'Algorithmic Adaptation' (policy shift), 'Bidirectional Learning Beyond Performance Metrics' (the core proposal of new metrics capturing cognitive and behavioral shifts), and 'Dynamic Feedback Loops in Socially Impactful Domains' (mentioning healthcare). The proposed methodology involving longitudinal studies and diverse metrics fits perfectly with the workshop's goal of exploring intricate interactions over extended periods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity. The motivation, main idea, methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact are well-articulated and logically structured. The methodology provides specific examples of metrics (accuracy, trust surveys, NASA-TLX, policy shift, uncertainty, bias drift) and analysis techniques (transfer entropy, DTW). The concept of a unified framework and a composite 'Coevolution Score' is understandable. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise calculation and weighting of the composite score, but this level of detail is often elaborated upon in a full paper rather than an initial idea description. Overall, the proposal is clearly defined and easy to grasp."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While research exists on human-AI interaction, adaptation, and specific metrics like trust or cognitive load, the proposal's novelty lies in integrating these into a *unified coevolutionary evaluation framework*. Specifically, framing the problem explicitly as quantifying *mutual adaptation* over long periods and proposing specific techniques like transfer entropy and DTW to capture the strength and direction of these feedback loops is innovative in the context of AI evaluation. It moves beyond evaluating AI or human factors in isolation, focusing instead on their dynamic interplay, which represents a fresh perspective compared to standard benchmarks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Longitudinal studies involving human participants are inherently complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. Continuously collecting diverse data streams (behavioral, cognitive via surveys/tools like NASA-TLX, and complex AI internal states like policy shifts or bias drift) requires sophisticated experimental infrastructure and data management. Furthermore, applying information-theoretic measures like transfer entropy or DTW effectively to potentially noisy and high-dimensional human-AI interaction data can be computationally demanding and requires careful methodological design. Defining and validating the proposed composite 'Coevolution Score' would also require substantial empirical work. While achievable in a dedicated research project, it's not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and increasingly recognized limitation of current AI evaluation methods, which often fail to capture the dynamics of long-term use. Understanding human-AI coevolution is crucial for developing AI systems that remain aligned, trustworthy, and beneficial as both the AI and its users adapt over time. This is particularly important in socially impactful domains like healthcare, education, and governance, as mentioned in the proposal and the workshop call. A framework providing actionable insights into these dynamics could lead to major advancements in designing safer, fairer, and more robust AI systems, directly contributing to the field's understanding of dynamic alignment and trust."
