    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the HAIC 2025 workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of Human-AI Coevolution (HAIC) by proposing a framework (AAC) focused on continuous human-AI coadaptation via real-time feedback. It aligns perfectly with several key subject areas, including 'Human-AI Interaction and Alignment' (focus on values, trust), 'Algorithmic Adaptation and Robustness' (RLHF enhancements, adaptability frameworks, bias reduction), and 'Dynamic Feedback Loops in Socially Impactful Domains' (real-time feedback in healthcare, education, criminal justice). The motivation explicitly mentions moving beyond static benchmarks, a key goal stated in the workshop description."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is clearly articulated and well-defined. The motivation, main concept (AAC framework), methodology components (real-time feedback, adaptive RL, context, ethics), expected outcomes, and potential impact are all presented logically and are easy to understand. The core proposal of using enhanced RLHF within a dynamic adaptation framework is clear. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific nature of the 'enhancements' to RLHF or the precise mechanisms for contextual adaptation and bias mitigation, but this level of detail is often appropriate for an initial research idea description."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates satisfactory novelty. While components like RLHF, NLP for feedback, and bias mitigation are existing research areas, the proposed novelty lies in their integration into a specific 'Adaptive AI Coevolution (AAC)' framework designed for continuous, real-time adaptation. The focus on the coevolutionary aspect, combining real-time NLP interpretation, adaptive RL, contextual awareness, and integrated fairness checks within a single dynamic loop offers a fresh perspective on applying these techniques. It's more of an innovative integration and application focus rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms, aligning well with the workshop's interest in frameworks and applications."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core technologies (RLHF, NLP) exist, but achieving robust real-time feedback interpretation and model adaptation is technically demanding. Challenges include handling noisy/ambiguous feedback, ensuring stability during continuous updates, managing computational costs, effectively incorporating context, and rigorously integrating and verifying bias mitigation within a dynamic system. Accessing appropriate real-world settings or high-fidelity simulations for development and testing would also be crucial and potentially difficult. It's feasible as a research direction but requires considerable effort and potentially novel engineering solutions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the dynamic alignment of AI systems with human values and preferences in real-time is a critical challenge for the safe and beneficial deployment of AI. Improving trust, user satisfaction, and fairness, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and criminal justice (as mentioned in both the idea and the task description), would represent a major advancement. Success in this research could provide crucial frameworks and insights for developing more trustworthy, adaptive, and human-centric AI systems, directly contributing to the core goals of the HAIC field."
