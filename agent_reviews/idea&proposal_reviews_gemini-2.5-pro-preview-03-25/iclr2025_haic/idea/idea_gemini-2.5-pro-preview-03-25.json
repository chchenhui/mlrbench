        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the HAIC 2025 workshop's task description. The workshop explicitly calls for moving beyond standard AI benchmarks to understand human-AI coadaptation over time. The idea directly addresses this by proposing 'Co-Adapt Metrics' derived from longitudinal studies of human cognitive shifts during AI interaction. It fits squarely within Subject Area 4: 'Bidirectional Learning Beyond Performance Metrics', particularly the points on 'how prolonged human-AI interactions shape cognition and decision-making' and 'Revising evaluation metrics to assess AI systems through the lens of HAIC'. The motivation and proposed approach directly tackle the core themes of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (limitations of current benchmarks), the core proposal (Co-Adapt Metrics framework based on longitudinal human cognitive shifts), the methodology (longitudinal studies tracking performance and human adaptation), and the expected outcome/impact (quantifiable metrics guiding AI design) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. While the specific details of the metrics and experimental design are not fully elaborated, this is appropriate for a research idea summary. The core concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While longitudinal studies and human adaptation are studied in HCI and psychology, framing human cognitive adaptation *as the basis for AI evaluation metrics* within the specific context of Human-AI Coevolution (HAIC) is innovative. It shifts the focus from purely AI performance or static human factors (like initial trust or usability) to the dynamic, evolving nature of the human collaborator's cognition as a measure of the AI system's quality and impact. This represents a fresh perspective on AI evaluation, moving beyond standard benchmarks in a meaningful way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Longitudinal studies are inherently resource-intensive, requiring sustained participant engagement, complex task design, and careful data collection over extended periods. Reliably measuring cognitive shifts (strategies, decision processes, skill changes) and attributing them specifically to AI interaction requires sophisticated experimental design and validated measurement techniques, which can be difficult to develop and apply. Operationalizing these observations into 'quantifiable metrics' is a non-trivial research challenge itself. While conceptually sound, the practical execution requires considerable effort, expertise, and funding."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the long-term cognitive effects of interacting with AI is crucial as these systems become more pervasive. Current evaluations often miss potential downsides like skill degradation or detrimental reliance patterns. Developing metrics that capture these co-adaptive dynamics could fundamentally change how AI systems are designed and evaluated, promoting the development of AI that truly complements and enhances human capabilities over the long term, rather than inadvertently undermining them. It addresses a critical gap in understanding the true utility and risks of AI, directly contributing to the core goals of HAIC research."
