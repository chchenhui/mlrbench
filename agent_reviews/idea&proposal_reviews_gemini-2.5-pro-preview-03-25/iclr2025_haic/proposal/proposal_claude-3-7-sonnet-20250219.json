    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (HAIC workshop focus on feedback loops, long-term coadaptation, bias, healthcare), the research idea (modeling/mitigating bias in healthcare HAIC loops via simulation, co-correction, validation), and the literature review (building on concepts like RL, causal mediation, XAI, fairness metrics, and acknowledging related work). It directly addresses multiple subject areas outlined in the task description, particularly 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. The methodology logically expands on the research idea, and the introduction and methods explicitly reference concepts and papers from the literature review. The proposed 'looping inequity' metric aligns with a paper mentioned in the literature review, showing consistency with the provided context, although this slightly impacts the novelty claim."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes) is logical and easy to follow. Research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology is broken down into understandable components (simulation, co-correction, validation) with specific techniques (RL, Q-learning, causal mediation, fairness constraints, XAI) clearly identified. Mathematical notations, while sometimes high-level (e.g., function placeholders like f_B, g_T), add precision without obscuring the core concepts. Implementation details regarding libraries provide further clarity. The overall research plan is articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. Its primary novelty lies in the integrated framework designed to model *bidirectional* human-AI adaptation over long periods and the proposed *bias-aware co-correction* mechanism that addresses both the AI (via causal mediation and constrained optimization) and human (via explanations and trust recalibration) sides of the feedback loop simultaneously. This integrated, dynamic, and bidirectional approach to bias mitigation in HAIC within healthcare distinguishes it from static fairness interventions or approaches focusing only on the AI side. However, the novelty of the 'looping inequity' metric is diminished as it is also mentioned in the provided literature review (Zhang & Patel, 2025). The proposal should ideally acknowledge this and clarify its contribution regarding the metric (e.g., application, validation, extension). While individual components (RL, causal mediation, XAI) exist, their synthesis within this specific HAIC framework for longitudinal bias analysis is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (RL, causal inference, fairness principles, behavioral modeling). The methodology employs established techniques (simulation, Q-learning, causal mediation analysis, constrained optimization, standard fairness metrics, XAI methods like SHAP/LIME) appropriately combined for the research question. The validation plan includes necessary components like baseline comparisons, relevant outcome measures (clinical, fairness, patient-centered), and expert review. Mathematical formulations are conceptually correct. Potential weaknesses lie in the inherent complexity of accurately modeling human behavior and trust dynamics (f_B, g_T) and the assumptions required for causal mediation, but the overall approach is well-justified and technically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It relies on standard, accessible technologies and libraries (Python, ML/RL frameworks, causal inference tools). The use of simulation and synthetic data (from public sources) makes the study of long-term effects tractable compared to real-world longitudinal trials. However, the project is ambitious. Developing accurate and validated simulation models (especially patient behavior and trust), generating high-fidelity synthetic data capturing relevant biases, and effectively implementing and tuning the complex co-correction mechanism require significant expertise and effort. The scope (5-year simulation, multiple components) is substantial. While feasible within a dedicated research effort, successful execution depends heavily on careful implementation and managing the inherent modeling complexities."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the potential for AI systems in healthcare to amplify health disparities through dynamic, long-term feedback loops with patients. This is a key challenge for the responsible deployment of AI in high-stakes domains. The research has the potential to make substantial contributions by providing a framework for understanding, measuring (e.g., via looping inequity), and mitigating these dynamic biases. Successful outcomes could lead to fairer AI-driven clinical decision support, inform regulatory guidelines, and promote health equity. The focus on longitudinal effects and bidirectional adaptation addresses a major gap in current algorithmic fairness research, extending its relevance beyond healthcare to other HAIC domains."
