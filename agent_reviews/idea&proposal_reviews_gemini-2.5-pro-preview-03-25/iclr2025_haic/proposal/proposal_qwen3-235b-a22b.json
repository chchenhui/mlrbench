        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the HAIC 2025 workshop's focus on feedback loops, long-term coadaptation, bias mitigation, healthcare applications, RL, and evaluation beyond static metrics. The methodology explicitly incorporates concepts and citations (Smith & Johnson 2023, Wilson & Thompson 2025, Martinez & Wang 2024, Patel & Nguyen 2024, Chen et al. 2024, Lee & Kim 2023, Zhang & Patel 2025) from the literature review, tackling the identified challenges like dynamic loops and bias perpetuation. The objectives and significance sections clearly link the work to specific workshop themes (e.g., Socio-Technological Bias, Algorithmic Adaptation, Bidirectional Learning, Dynamic Feedback Loops)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section clearly outlines the simulation components, RL formulation, bias-correction mechanism, case study design, baselines, and evaluation metrics. Technical concepts like causal mediation and the RL objective are presented concisely. While highly detailed for a proposal, minor implementation specifics (e.g., exact integration of mediation into RL updates) could be further elaborated in a full paper, but this does not detract significantly from the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like RL, causal mediation, and XAI exist, their integration into a cohesive framework specifically designed to model and mitigate bias in *bidirectional*, *long-term* human-AI feedback loops in healthcare is novel. It moves beyond static fairness or standard RLHF by explicitly modeling patient adaptation and using causal mediation dynamically within the loop. The 'bias-aware co-correction mechanism' combining algorithmic adjustment and patient-facing explanations as a unified strategy is a fresh perspective. The proposed use/validation of the recent 'looping inequity' metric also contributes to its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in RL, causal inference, and fairness in AI. The proposed methodology, including the simulation framework, RL formulation with a dynamic fairness term, use of causal mediation for bias decomposition, and a mixed-methods evaluation (simulation + real data + human subject testing for explanations), is well-justified and appropriate for the research questions. Using both synthetic and real-world data, along with relevant baselines, strengthens the experimental design. Potential challenges exist in the assumptions of causal mediation and the complexity of dynamic integration, but the overall approach is technically sound. The statistical analysis plan using multilevel modeling is appropriate for the longitudinal data."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. It requires significant resources: access to specific synthetic data tools, real-world EHR data (Cedars-Sinai access implied), computational power for RL and simulation, and expertise spanning ML, causal inference, healthcare, and potentially HCI. The proposed human-subject trial (n=200) for explanation testing adds complexity (IRB, recruitment). While the plan is generally realistic, the integration of multiple complex components (dynamic RL, causal mediation, behavioral simulation, explanations) presents technical challenges and risks potential delays or requires simplification. It is feasible within a well-equipped research environment but requires careful project management."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the potential for AI systems in high-stakes domains like healthcare to amplify societal biases through dynamic feedback loops. Successfully developing and validating the proposed framework could lead to major advancements in building fairer, more trustworthy, and equitable AI systems. The potential impact spans scientific understanding (advancing HAIC theory), practical applications (tools for developers, reduced health disparities), and policy/ethics (informing regulations and guidelines). The research directly aligns with pressing societal concerns about AI fairness and the specific goals of the HAIC workshop."
