    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (focusing on efficient fine-tuning and personalized adaptation for adaptive FMs), the research idea (elaborating on dynamic sparse adapters, RL, meta-learning for scalable personalization), and the literature review (situating the work within recent PEFT advancements like AdaLoRA, QEFT, Light-PEFT, and addressing identified challenges like scalability and dynamic adaptation). It clearly defines how DSAs aim to overcome limitations of existing methods discussed in the literature (e.g., static allocation, memory cost of dense adapters) and directly addresses the workshop themes."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (including DSA design, gating network, RL formulation, meta-learning integration), and evaluation plan are presented logically and in detail. The core concept of dynamic sparse adapters is explained well. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise state representation for RL or the exact scheduling of the alternating optimization, but these do not significantly hinder understanding. The structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While leveraging existing concepts (PEFT, sparsity, RL, meta-learning), the core idea of using a dynamically learned, user/context-specific sparse mask via RL for adapter parameters in the context of large-scale personalization appears novel. It clearly distinguishes itself from static PEFT methods, dense adapters, and adaptive budget allocation methods like AdaLoRA (which adapts globally, not per-user dynamically). The combination of these techniques specifically for scalable personalization is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established ML techniques (PEFT, RL policy gradients, MAML). The mathematical formulations for the core ideas are presented. However, the integration of RL for optimizing sparsity gating introduces significant complexity. Potential challenges include RL training stability (e.g., high variance gradients, reward shaping), the effectiveness of the gating network in learning meaningful sparse patterns, and potential convergence issues in the alternating optimization scheme. While conceptually sound, the practical realization requires careful implementation and validation, making the soundness good but not excellent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges and resource requirements. Implementing and debugging the combined system (FMs, sparse adapters, RL gating, meta-learning) is complex and requires substantial computational resources and expertise. Training stability for RL and meta-learning components is a known challenge. While the use of public datasets and standard FMs is practical, the overall scope (multiple modalities, extensive baselines, ablations) is ambitious. The risks associated with RL convergence and achieving theoretical efficiency gains in practice are manageable but non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: enabling scalable and efficient personalization of powerful foundation models. This is a critical bottleneck for deploying user-centric AI widely. Success would have substantial impact, potentially enabling personalization for millions/billions of users, reducing computational costs (inference efficiency), facilitating edge deployment, and democratizing personalized AI. The research directly contributes novel methodology to the PEFT landscape and aligns perfectly with the growing need for adaptive AI systems."
