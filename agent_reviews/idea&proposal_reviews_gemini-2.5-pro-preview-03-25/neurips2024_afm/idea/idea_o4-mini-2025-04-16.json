    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics outlined: 'Continual Weight Updates' (via adapter fine-tuning and EWC), 'Efficient Fine-Tuning' (using lightweight LoRA adapters with <5% overhead), 'Personalized Adaptation' (core focus on user preferences and history), and 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation' (explicitly using a Global-RAG adapter). It tackles the central theme of creating adaptive foundation models that learn continually, efficiently, and are personalized, matching the workshop's goals precisely."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-defined for a research proposal summary. The motivation is clear, and the main components (three adapter types, meta-controller, fusion mechanism, EWC, prompt-gating) are identified along with their intended functions. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact architecture of the meta-controller and the specifics of the 'prompt-based gating filters', but the overall concept and workflow are understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like LoRA adapters, RAG, and EWC are established techniques, the proposed combination and architecture are innovative. Specifically, the use of multiple, specialized adapter modules (Global-RAG, User-History, Situational-Context) dynamically managed and fused by a learned meta-controller for continual personalization represents a fresh approach. The dynamic routing and fusion based on context is a notable contribution beyond static adapter application or standard RAG."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It leverages existing and well-understood techniques like LoRA, RAG, and EWC. Implementing and training individual adapters is practical. The main challenge lies in designing, training, and evaluating the meta-controller for effective dynamic routing and fusion, which might require significant experimentation and tuning. Managing the different data sources (corpora, logs, session context) also adds complexity, but is achievable. The focus on lightweight adapters (<5% overhead) enhances its practical feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. It addresses the critical and timely problem of enabling foundation models to adapt continually and efficiently to new knowledge and user-specific needs without catastrophic forgetting or prohibitive computational costs. Success in this area would represent a major advancement for deploying personalized AI systems in real-world, dynamic environments, directly impacting user experience and model utility across various applications."
