    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory policies, focusing on the tensions between fairness, privacy, and explainability. The methodology (causal graphs, multi-objective adversarial training, benchmark) precisely implements the research idea. It also builds upon and synthesizes concepts from the provided literature (causality for trade-offs, adversarial learning) while acknowledging the key challenges identified therein. The objectives and significance strongly resonate with the task's call for operationalizing guidelines and developing auditing frameworks."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, outlining the background, objectives, methodology, and expected impact logically. The three main components of the methodology are distinctly presented with algorithmic steps. However, the mathematical formulations provided are very high-level and lack specific detail (e.g., how privacy and explainability losses ℒ_i are defined within the adversarial framework). While the overall concept is understandable, these technical details require further elaboration for complete clarity on the implementation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using causality for fairness/trade-offs and adversarial methods for fairness/privacy exists in the literature (as cited), the specific combination of using a causal framework to *inform* a *multi-objective adversarial training* system designed to *simultaneously* harmonize fairness, privacy, *and* explainability appears novel. The integration of these three specific desiderata within this combined causal-adversarial approach represents a fresh perspective compared to prior work often focusing on pairs of objectives or single objectives. The proposed 'regulatory stress-test' benchmark also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, grounded in established concepts like causal inference and adversarial learning. The high-level approach of using causality to understand relationships and adversarial training to enforce constraints is reasonable. However, the soundness is weakened by the lack of technical depth. The mathematical formulations are abstract placeholders. Crucial details, such as how explainability is operationalized as an adversarial objective or how differential privacy guarantees are enforced via the discriminator, are missing. Furthermore, the proposal relies heavily on the ability to perform accurate causal discovery from data, which is notoriously challenging and often requires strong, potentially untestable assumptions. The reliance on high-level descriptions rather than concrete technical formulations prevents a higher score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Accurate causal discovery (using PC/FCI or other methods) is difficult, especially in complex, real-world domains with potential hidden confounders. Multi-objective adversarial training involving multiple discriminators and potentially complex optimization algorithms (like MOO-PSO) is computationally expensive, potentially unstable, and hard to tune. Creating a comprehensive benchmark requires substantial effort in data curation/generation and evaluation infrastructure. While the individual techniques exist, their successful integration into a robust, scalable framework is ambitious and carries considerable implementation risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of ML, ethics, and regulation – the need to reconcile potentially conflicting requirements like fairness, privacy, and explainability. Successfully developing such a framework would be a major contribution to trustworthy AI, providing practical tools for building and auditing compliant ML systems in high-stakes domains (healthcare, finance). The research directly tackles core issues highlighted in the workshop call and has the potential for substantial impact on both research and practice."
