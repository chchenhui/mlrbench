    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call to bridge the gap between ML research and regulatory policies by focusing on operationalizing fairness, privacy, and explainability, and mitigating their inherent tensions. The methodology clearly expands on the research idea's core concepts (causal graphs, multi-objective adversarial training, benchmark). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself as a response to the identified challenges, such as the need for causal methods to balance multiple goals (Binkyte et al., Ji et al.) and extending adversarial techniques (Lahoti et al.) to a multi-objective setting."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the structure follows a logical progression. The methodology section details the technical approach using SCMs, do-calculus, and specific loss functions for the adversarial training. The notation is generally standard and understandable. Minor ambiguities exist: Figure 1 is referenced but not provided, and the formulation of the explainability loss (\\mathcal{L}_E) as training an auxiliary explainer is slightly less integrated into the core adversarial framework compared to the fairness and privacy losses, which directly penalize the main model. However, these points do not significantly obscure the overall research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality and innovation. While causal inference and adversarial learning are established techniques, their proposed integration into a unified framework specifically designed to *simultaneously* harmonize fairness, privacy, *and* explainability using causal disentanglement and multi-objective optimization is novel. It extends prior work that focused on pairs of objectives (e.g., fairness-accuracy, fairness-explainability) or advocated for causality without presenting such a specific, integrated algorithmic solution. The development of a dedicated 'regulatory stress-test' benchmark also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, based on established concepts like SCMs and adversarial learning. However, there are weaknesses. A core assumption is the ability to reliably learn accurate causal graphs from data, which is notoriously challenging ('causal discovery algorithms' are mentioned but the difficulty is understated). The soundness hinges on the correctness of this learned graph. Secondly, the connection between the proposed adversarial losses and formal definitions or guarantees of fairness (beyond demographic parity implicitly targeted by \\mathcal{L}_F), privacy (e.g., differential privacy vs. inference risk targeted by \\mathcal{L}_P), and explainability (where \\mathcal{L}_E focuses on fidelity of a separate explainer, not inherent model interpretability) needs stronger justification or empirical validation. The technical formulations are mostly correct, but the conceptual link between the proposed mechanisms and the targeted regulatory principles could be stronger."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Both causal discovery (especially with latent confounders using algorithms like FCI) and multi-objective adversarial training (balancing three discriminators and the main task loss, ensuring stable convergence) are technically demanding and computationally intensive. Curating appropriate real-world datasets is achievable but requires effort. The successful integration of these complex components into a robust working system is uncertain and carries substantial implementation risks. The ambitious scope covering modeling, optimization, and benchmarking adds to the feasibility concerns."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the need for ML systems to comply with multiple, potentially conflicting regulatory requirements (fairness, privacy, explainability) simultaneously. This is a critical barrier to deploying ML in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance. A successful outcome, providing a causally-grounded framework for harmonizing these principles, would represent a major advancement in trustworthy AI and have substantial impact on policy compliance, research methodology (promoting causal approaches), and industry practice (providing auditing tools)."
