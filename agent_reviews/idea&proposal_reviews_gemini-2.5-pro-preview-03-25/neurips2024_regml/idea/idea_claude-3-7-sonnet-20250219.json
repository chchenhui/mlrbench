    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the need for 'Evaluation and auditing frameworks for ensuring that ML models comply with regulatory guidelines'. It also tackles the 'operational gaps between existing regulations and SOTA ML research' by focusing on continuous monitoring post-deployment, a known challenge. The proposal aims to bridge the gap between dynamic ML systems and evolving regulatory policies, which is central to the workshop's theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem of continuous compliance monitoring. The main idea is well-defined and broken down into four logical components (knowledge base, monitoring probes, drift detection, reporting system). The overall goal and the intended functionality are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While components like drift detection or model monitoring exist, the proposed integration into a comprehensive, automated framework specifically for *continuous regulatory compliance* is innovative. The concept of a semantic regulatory knowledge base mapping legal principles to measurable technical properties, combined with automated probes and compliance-specific drift detection, offers a fresh perspective compared to standard MLOps monitoring or pre-deployment checks. It builds upon existing concepts but combines them in a novel way to address a specific regulatory challenge."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is satisfactory but presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in creating the 'regulatory knowledge base' that accurately maps complex, often ambiguous legal text from multiple regulations (GDPR, AI Act, etc.) into precise, measurable technical properties. This requires deep interdisciplinary expertise (ML, law, ethics) and may face interpretation issues. Designing 'automated monitoring probes' that are non-disruptive yet comprehensive enough to cover diverse compliance aspects (fairness, privacy, transparency) across different model types and deployment environments is also technically challenging. While individual components might be feasible research directions, building the complete, robust, and general framework as described is ambitious and faces considerable implementation hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Ensuring ongoing compliance of deployed ML systems with evolving regulations is a critical, unmet need for organizations deploying AI. Failure to comply carries substantial legal, financial, and reputational risks. An effective automated monitoring framework would provide immense value by enabling continuous verification, reducing manual effort, and fostering trust in AI systems. It directly addresses a major bottleneck in the responsible deployment of ML, making the potential impact substantial."
