        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core challenge of bridging the gap between regulatory policies (GDPR, EU AI Act) and ML implementation by proposing a method to translate legal text into algorithmic constraints. It touches upon key workshop topics like operationalizing guidelines, creating frameworks for compliance (fairness, privacy, explainability), and operationalizing rights (right to be forgotten via auditors). The focus on automating the translation from policy to code is highly relevant to the workshop's aim of finding solutions to operationalize regulations."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. It outlines a distinct two-stage pipeline (NLP processing + DSL compilation) with clear inputs (regulatory documents) and outputs (executable code modules like loss functions, auditors, tests). The motivation is well-articulated, and the specific components (dependency parsing, ontology mapping, DSL compiler, target platforms like PyTorch/TensorFlow) are mentioned, making the proposed approach highly understandable. The evaluation plan using case studies and specific metrics further enhances clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While components like NLP for legal text analysis, ML fairness/privacy constraints, and DSLs exist individually, the proposed integration into an end-to-end pipeline specifically designed to automatically compile legal text into diverse, executable ML compliance artifacts (loss functions, runtime auditors, test generators) represents a novel approach. The combination of NLP interpretation, ontology mapping, and DSL compilation for this specific purpose offers a fresh perspective on automating regulatory compliance in ML."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. The NLP component required to accurately parse complex and potentially ambiguous legal text is ambitious and achieving high reliability will be difficult. Designing a comprehensive and accurate ontology mapping ML desiderata to legal concepts requires deep expertise in both domains. Building a robust DSL compiler that generates correct and efficient code for various ML frameworks is a substantial engineering task. While feasible with current technology, successful implementation requires overcoming these considerable hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying trustworthy AI: the difficulty of translating complex legal regulations into concrete technical implementations. Automating this process could drastically reduce development time, costs, and errors associated with manual interpretation, thereby accelerating the adoption of compliant ML systems. Success would represent a major advancement in operationalizing AI ethics and regulations, directly contributing to safer and more transparent AI deployments, which is a key concern highlighted in the workshop description."
