        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory policies, specifically focusing on the 'right to explanation' mandated by regulations like GDPR. It falls squarely under the listed workshop topics, particularly 'Evaluation and auditing frameworks for ensuring that ML models comply with regulatory guidelines' and is highly relevant to 'Novel algorithmic frameworks to operationalize the right to explanation' by proposing a method to verify such operationalization. The idea tackles the challenge of translating legal requirements into verifiable technical standards, which is a central focus of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem: the difficulty in verifying compliance with the 'right to explanation'. The main idea is well-defined, specifying a semi-automated framework combining technical metrics (fidelity, stability) and human evaluation (intelligibility, actionability) based on regulatory criteria. The proposed methodology (defining metrics, user study protocols, scoring system) and expected outcomes (toolkit, methodology) are clearly articulated. While specific technical details are omitted, the overall concept and approach are immediately understandable and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like technical explanation metrics (fidelity, stability) and user studies for evaluating explanations exist, the proposed integration into a *standardized auditing framework* specifically designed to assess *regulatory compliance* with the 'right to explanation' is innovative. It moves beyond simply generating or evaluating explanations to creating a systematic process for auditing against legal requirements. The combination of technical rigor and structured human evaluation within this specific regulatory context offers a fresh perspective compared to existing work focused primarily on XAI methods themselves."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Defining technical metrics for fidelity and stability builds on existing XAI research. Designing and conducting user studies is standard practice in HCI and XAI, although ensuring diverse representation and robust protocols requires effort. Creating an integrated scoring system is achievable. However, challenges exist: precisely translating ambiguous legal terms like 'intelligibility' or 'sufficiency' into quantifiable metrics and universally applicable user study protocols is non-trivial. Standardizing the framework across diverse ML models and application domains will require careful design and validation. Overall, it's feasible within a research context but requires careful execution and potentially significant effort for standardization."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Ensuring ML systems comply with regulations like GDPR is a critical challenge for organizations deploying AI. The 'right to explanation' is a cornerstone of algorithmic accountability, yet practical methods for auditing compliance are lacking. This research directly addresses this gap. A successful framework would provide immense value to regulators, auditors, and developers, fostering trust and responsible AI deployment. It has the potential to directly influence industry standards and regulatory practices concerning AI explanations, making it a highly impactful contribution to the field of regulatable ML."
