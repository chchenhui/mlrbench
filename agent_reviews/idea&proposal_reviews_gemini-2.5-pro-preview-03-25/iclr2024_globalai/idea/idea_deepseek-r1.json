    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop theme 'Scalable Cultural Representation Evaluations' by proposing a framework to test cross-cultural performance using metrics, diverse datasets, and feedback loops. It also touches upon 'Conceptual and Theoretical Foundations' by operationalizing cultural inclusivity, 'Culturally-Rich Training Datasets' by proposing curation of test data, and 'Methods to study cultural values' through automated metrics. The motivation and expected outcomes resonate strongly with the workshop's goal of building globally-inclusive AI and understanding its cultural dimensions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main components (automated metrics, crowdsourced data, dynamic pipelines, feedback loops), and expected outcomes are clearly presented. The breakdown into four key activities provides a good structure. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific NLP techniques for detecting abstract cultural values (like individualism vs. collectivism) and the precise mechanisms of the 'dynamic evaluation pipelines', but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While evaluating AI for bias and performance across groups exists, the specific focus on creating a *systematic, scalable framework dedicated to cultural dimensions* (references, values, norms) using a combination of automated metrics, curated diverse datasets, dynamic pipelines, and human feedback loops offers a novel synthesis. Applying NLP to detect specific cultural values and semantics within a structured evaluation framework is an innovative aspect. It moves beyond simple demographic or linguistic evaluation towards more nuanced cultural assessment."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing reliable automated metrics for complex cultural concepts like values is technically demanding and requires substantial research. Curating high-quality, genuinely representative cross-cultural test data via crowdsourcing and expert partnerships is logistically complex and resource-intensive. While integrating evaluation pipelines and feedback loops is standard, ensuring the cultural validity and scalability of the entire framework requires considerable effort, expertise across ML, NLP, and cultural studies, and significant resources. The ambition level makes full implementation challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the lack of systematic methods for evaluating cultural inclusivity in AI, which risks perpetuating biases and hindering equitable global deployment. Developing such a framework could lead to major advancements in building fairer AI systems, provide valuable tools and benchmarks for the community, and foster AI that better serves diverse global populations. The potential impact on responsible AI development and mitigating negative cultural consequences is substantial."
