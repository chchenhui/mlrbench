        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea 'GlobalCultureScore' aligns excellently with the task description. The task calls for developing methods for 'Scalable Cultural Representation Evaluations' to test cross-cultural performance using metrics like representation and inclusion. The proposed idea directly addresses this by outlining a framework with modules for lexicon extraction, multi-dimensional scoring (including representation coverage and cultural sensitivity), and calibration, explicitly aiming for a scalable evaluation metric. It fits perfectly within the workshop's theme of building and evaluating globally inclusive AI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It presents a structured three-module pipeline (Lexicon Extraction, Scoring, Feedback Loop) with defined components and expected outcomes. The motivation is clear. However, some operational details could be more precise, such as the exact methodology for curating corpora with cultural experts, the generation/selection of region-specific embeddings, the specifics of the adversarial dataset creation and learning for sensitivity scoring, and the mechanics of the feedback loop calibration. Minor refinements would enhance precision, but the core concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like lexicon mining, embedding similarity, and adversarial testing for bias exist, their integration into a unified, multi-dimensional, scalable framework specifically for *cross-cultural* AI evaluation (GlobalCultureScore) is innovative. The combination of automated extraction, quantitative scoring across representation/semantics/sensitivity, and a human-in-the-loop calibration for cultural nuances offers a fresh approach compared to existing bias evaluations often focused on single dimensions (e.g., gender) or qualitative assessments."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Key hurdles include: 1) Scalably curating culturally rich lexicons requiring substantial input from diverse cultural experts. 2) Creating robust, representative region-specific embeddings. 3) Developing a meaningful and unbiased 'Cultural Sensitivity' module, especially the creation of a diverse, annotated adversarial dataset covering numerous cultural taboos/stereotypes, which is complex and sensitive. 4) Implementing the large-scale (10+ countries) user study and feedback loop is logistically demanding and expensive. Considerable resources and methodological rigor are needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of cultural bias and lack of representation in globally deployed AI systems, a core concern highlighted in the task description. Developing a scalable, quantitative metric like GlobalCultureScore could lead to major advancements in building and auditing culturally inclusive AI, mitigating harm, fostering global trust, and guiding responsible AI development practices. It tackles a key gap in current AI evaluation methodologies."
