        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (Global AI Cultures workshop). It directly addresses the workshop's central goal of building globally-inclusive AI that respects cultural sensibilities. The five methodological points outlined in the idea map almost one-to-one onto the six themes listed in the workshop description, covering conceptual foundations, datasets, evaluation, cultural values, user interaction, and impact analysis. The multidisciplinary approach mentioned in the idea also mirrors the workshop's aim to bring together AI researchers and humanities/social science scholars."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main goal (developing a framework), and methodology (broken down into five distinct steps) are articulated concisely and logically. The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. While the term 'framework' can sometimes be broad, the specific components listed provide substantial clarity on the intended scope and activities. There are no significant ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While the general problem of cultural bias in AI is recognized, the proposed approach of creating a comprehensive, integrated framework that systematically combines insights from humanities/social sciences across the AI lifecycle (from conceptualization and data to UI and impact analysis) is innovative. Many efforts focus on specific aspects, but this proposal outlines a holistic, structured, and explicitly multidisciplinary methodology, which offers a fresh perspective compared to siloed approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Developing a comprehensive framework covering all outlined aspects is a massive undertaking. Specifically, creating 'culturally-rich datasets' that are truly representative and unbiased at scale is extremely difficult, requiring immense resources, global collaboration, and navigating complex ethical issues. Similarly, developing robust methods to automatically 'recognize and account for cultural values' within AI pipelines is a major technical and conceptual challenge representing an open research area. While individual components are researchable, implementing the full, integrated framework presents considerable practical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and increasingly urgent problem of cultural bias and lack of inclusivity in globally deployed AI systems. Successfully developing such a framework could lead to major advancements in responsible AI, resulting in fairer, more equitable, and culturally respectful technologies. It directly tackles the concerns outlined in the task description regarding the potential negative impacts of culturally unaware AI on global cultures, making its potential contribution substantial."
