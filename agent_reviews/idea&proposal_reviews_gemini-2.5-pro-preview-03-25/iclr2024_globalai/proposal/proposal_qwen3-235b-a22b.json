    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core goal of building globally inclusive AI by proposing the Cultural Calibration Framework (CCF), which aligns perfectly with the research idea. It tackles key themes from the task description, such as scalable evaluation (DTP), culturally rich data (CVV creation), studying cultural values (CVVs), and bridging AI research with humanities/social sciences (participatory governance). The proposal effectively synthesizes the challenges identified in the literature review (data bias, evaluation gaps, Western-centric models) and proposes concrete solutions grounded in that context, citing relevant papers like Tao et al. (2023) and Bayramli et al. (2025)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology, validation, and impact. The three core components (CVV, DTP, AWM) are explained with conceptual foundations and implementation details. The research objectives are explicitly listed. Mathematical formulations add precision, although they might reduce accessibility for non-technical readers. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact execution of the large-scale participatory research and data annotation across 20 diverse groups. The absence of the referenced Figure 1 slightly hinders full visualization of the workflow. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and understandable, with only minor areas needing potential refinement."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing work on cultural bias detection and mitigation (e.g., cultural prompting mentioned by Tao et al.), the proposed Cultural Calibration Framework (CCF) offers a more systematic and integrated approach. The key novel elements include: 1) The Cultural Value Vectors (CVVs) as quantifiable, multi-faceted representations derived from participatory methods and incorporating uncertainty. 2) The specific Differential Testing Protocol (DTP) combining vector comparisons, standard metrics, and human evaluation tailored for cultural assessment. 3) The Adaptive Weighting Mechanism (AWM) for dynamic, context-aware model adjustment during inference. The combination of these components within a single framework that includes participatory governance distinguishes it significantly from prior ad-hoc solutions or purely analytical studies identified in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, grounded in relevant literature from AI ethics, cultural studies, and participatory research. The methodology employs established techniques (BERT encoders, PCA, ANCOVA, contrastive learning, human evaluation). The inclusion of uncertainty bounds for CVVs and stakeholder validation for DTP adds rigor. However, the core challenge of operationalizing complex 'cultural norms, aesthetics, and values' into quantitative vectors (CVVs) is significant and carries inherent risks of reductionism or essentialism, even with the proposed mitigation strategies (entropy calculation). The mathematical notation for CVV components using partial derivatives is unconventional and could be expressed more clearly. The effectiveness of the AWM relies heavily on the quality of the CVVs and the context detector's ability to generalize across diverse inputs. While generally well-founded, the translation of cultural concepts into robust technical components requires careful execution and validation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily related to its scale and complexity. Partnering with 20 diverse cultural groups globally, conducting surveys (10,000+ participants total), curating massive annotated datasets (1 million prompts total), and managing large-scale human evaluations (200+ experts, 3000+ crowdworkers) requires immense resources, logistical coordination, time, and robust ethical oversight. Building and maintaining these global partnerships effectively is non-trivial. Technically, developing high-fidelity CVVs and ensuring the AWM works reliably across such cultural diversity are major hurdles. While the individual technical steps are known, their integration and successful application at this scale are ambitious and carry substantial risks regarding data quality, partnership sustainability, and achieving the target performance metrics. The project scope seems more suited for a large consortium than a single typical research grant."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of cultural bias and lack of inclusivity in generative AI, a major challenge as these technologies are deployed globally. Successfully developing the CCF could lead to major advancements in responsible AI, promoting equity and relevance for underrepresented cultures ('epistemic justice'). The potential contributions – public CVV datasets, the CultEval benchmark, the AWM algorithm, and influencing industry/policy standards (UNESCO collaboration) – are substantial. It directly aligns with the workshop's goal of building globally inclusive AI and has clear potential to improve AI functionality for diverse users and mitigate representation harms, making a potentially transformative contribution to the field."
