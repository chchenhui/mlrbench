        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of cultural bias in AI outlined in the task description and motivation. The objectives (developing a framework, shared vocabulary, collaboration, scalable evaluations, recommendations) map clearly onto the workshop themes (conceptual foundations, scalable evaluations, datasets, cultural values). The proposed framework (Cultural Value Vectors, Differential Testing, Adaptive Weighting) is a direct elaboration of the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal acknowledges the issues raised in the literature review (data bias, evaluation gaps, need for frameworks) and positions itself as a solution addressing these identified challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear in its overall structure, objectives, and significance. The motivation and high-level concept of the Cultural Calibration Framework are well-articulated. However, the clarity diminishes significantly in the methodology section. Key technical components like 'Cultural Value Vectors' and the 'Adaptive Weighting Mechanism' are described conceptually but lack precise definition. The mathematical formulations provided (e.g., CV = f(D), O = W * M(I)) are too high-level to be informative. Crucial details about how cultural dimensions are identified and encoded, how the weighting matrix W is learned via RL (reward function, state/action space), how cultural context is detected, and how the evaluation metrics are operationalized are missing, leaving significant ambiguity about the practical implementation and workings of the core methods."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While research exists on cultural bias detection, evaluation, and dataset diversity (as shown in the literature review), the proposed 'Cultural Calibration Framework' offers a novel, integrated system. The combination of Cultural Value Vectors (specifically derived from annotated community data for calibration), a Differential Testing Protocol feeding into an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism (dynamically adjusting outputs based on detected context, vectors, and testing) appears to be a fresh approach. It moves beyond static bias analysis or simple prompting towards a dynamic, context-aware calibration loop within the generative process itself. The integration of computational methods with participatory approaches within this specific framework structure is also a strong point of novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is conceptually sound in its motivation and high-level approach, grounding itself in the well-documented problem of cultural bias. However, it lacks methodological rigor and detailed technical formulation. The descriptions of the Cultural Value Vectors and Adaptive Weighting Mechanism are underdeveloped. Key assumptions, such as the ability to reliably capture complex cultural nuances in vectors and the effectiveness of the proposed weighting mechanism without adverse effects, are not sufficiently justified or explored. The mathematical representations are superficial, and the reliance on techniques like PCA/Autoencoders or RL is mentioned without specific justification or detailed implementation plans. The operationalization of evaluation metrics (Representation, Quality, Impact, Inclusion) is also missing, weakening the proposed testing protocol's rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The data collection and annotation process across diverse cultures involving community members and experts is highly resource-intensive (time, cost, coordination) and complex to manage reliably. Developing robust Cultural Value Vectors and operationalizing the evaluation metrics are non-trivial research tasks in themselves. The technical implementation of the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism, especially using RL integrated with large generative models and cultural context detection, is highly complex and computationally expensive. Meaningful participatory research and stakeholder engagement at scale also pose logistical hurdles. While the goals are achievable in principle over a long-term research program, the proposal underestimates the practical difficulties and resource requirements for successful execution within a typical project scope."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and increasingly critical problem: the cultural bias embedded in generative AI systems and its potential global impact. Developing a framework to systematically identify, measure, and adjust these biases would be a major contribution to creating more equitable, inclusive, and effective AI technologies worldwide. Success in this research could lead to substantial advancements in AI ethics, fairness, cross-cultural HCI, and influence industry practices for developing globally responsible AI. The potential impact on promoting diverse cultural representation and enhancing user experience for non-Western users is substantial."
