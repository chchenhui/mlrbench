    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core goal of building globally inclusive AI by proposing a concrete framework (CCF) outlined in the research idea. It tackles key themes from the task description, such as scalable evaluation (Differential Testing), culturally rich data (Data Collection), and methods to study cultural values (Value Vectors). The proposal effectively synthesizes the literature review, citing relevant work (Tao et al., Zhou et al., Bayramli et al.) and positioning itself to address identified gaps, particularly the need for a unified framework and better evaluation methods. It aims to bridge AI techniques with cultural understanding, although the collaboration aspect with humanities/social sciences could be slightly more emphasized beyond expert annotation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to detailed methodology and expected impact. The research objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. Each component of the proposed framework (Cultural Value Vectors, Differential Testing, Adaptive Weighting) is explained with sufficient detail, including technical formulations (loss functions, metrics, adjustment mechanism). The rationale and significance are compellingly articulated. While some implementation details (e.g., specific model architectures for contrastive learning or context classification) are omitted, this is appropriate for a proposal. Overall, it is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components draw on existing concepts (contrastive learning, bias metrics, adaptive mechanisms), their integration into the holistic Cultural Calibration Framework (CCF) is novel. Specifically, the proposed method for creating 'Cultural Value Vectors' via contrastive learning on culturally annotated data and the 'Adaptive Weighting Mechanism' for dynamic, context-aware output adjustment represent fresh approaches compared to static fine-tuning or simple prompting methods discussed in the literature (e.g., Tao et al.). The emphasis on a systematic, multi-component framework for both evaluation and mitigation distinguishes it from prior work focusing on specific aspects of cultural bias."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in relevant literature and employs established machine learning techniques (contrastive learning, classification, multi-task learning, ANOVA). The proposed methodology for vector creation, differential testing (using defined metrics like CRS and DI with statistical validation), and adaptive weighting is technically plausible and well-justified. The mathematical formulations provided are generally correct and clearly presented. Key assumptions, such as the ability to capture cultural dimensions in vectors and reliably detect context, are acknowledged implicitly and represent reasonable starting points for research. The reliance on Hofstede's dimensions (or similar) for annotation provides a theoretical grounding, though the complexity of culture might require further refinement."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily related to scale and resources. Data collection across 10+ diverse cultures, requiring partnerships and high-quality annotation by cultural experts, is ambitious and potentially costly and time-consuming. Recruiting 500+ diverse participants for user studies and conducting expert reviews for the CRS metric also demand substantial resources. While the technical components (model training, fine-tuning, implementing mechanisms) are feasible with adequate computational resources, the data acquisition and large-scale human evaluation aspects make the overall plan challenging within typical project constraints. A phased approach or reduced scope might improve feasibility."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of cultural bias in generative AI, which has profound implications for global communication, cultural representation, and equity as AI systems become more pervasive. The proposed CCF offers a potential pathway to systematically evaluate and mitigate these biases, contributing directly to the development of more inclusive and globally relevant AI. Successful outcomes, such as validated bias reduction methods and open-source tools, could have substantial technical impact (improving model robustness), societal impact (promoting cultural diversity, reducing harm), and potentially inform policy and industry best practices, aligning with the goals of the EU AI Act and UNESCO."
