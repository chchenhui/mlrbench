        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of Western-centric AI outlined in the task description and workshop themes (e.g., cultural evaluation, representation, embedded values). It meticulously elaborates on the 'Cultural Calibration Framework' idea, detailing its components (CVV, DTP, AWM). Furthermore, it explicitly references key findings and challenges from the provided literature review (e.g., citing Tao et al., Peters & Carman, Zhou et al., Bayramli et al., and addressing issues like data bias and evaluation gaps), positioning the work effectively within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives (Develop CVV, Design DTP, Create AWM, Validate CCF) are explicitly stated and logically connected. The methodology is broken down into distinct, understandable phases with specific techniques suggested for each. The background and significance sections clearly articulate the rationale. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise mathematical formulation beyond the example provided and the exact operationalization of 'cultural dimensions', but these are acceptable at the proposal stage. Overall, the proposal is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components draw on existing concepts (cultural dimensions, bias evaluation, conditional generation), the synthesis into a single, systematic 'Cultural Calibration Framework' (CCF) specifically for generative AI is novel. The proposed CVVs as computational representations of cultural values for AI conditioning, the DTP as a standardized *differential* cultural testing protocol, and the AWM applying adaptation techniques guided by CVVs represent fresh perspectives. It moves beyond simple benchmarking or prompting towards a more integrated solution, clearly distinguishing itself from prior work mentioned in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in relevant theories (cross-cultural psychology) and established ML techniques (contrastive learning, LoRA, etc.). The mixed-methods approach (computational, participatory, user studies) is appropriate, and the phased research design is logical. It acknowledges the complexity by including qualitative metrics and ethical considerations. However, the inherent difficulty of computationally modeling 'culture' poses a significant challenge, risking oversimplification (though acknowledged). The effectiveness of lightweight AWM needs empirical validation. While an example mathematical formulation is given, more detail on the proposed mappings and vector representations would strengthen the technical rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the proposed ML techniques and use of existing models are technically plausible, the project demands substantial resources: extensive cross-cultural data collection/annotation (ethically complex and costly), significant computational power, diverse expertise (ML, social sciences, ethics), and strong community partnerships. The plan to start with a limited scope (specific domain, 3-5 cultures) improves feasibility, but data acquisition, ensuring representative participation, and conducting cross-cultural user studies remain major hurdles. Success is heavily dependent on securing adequate resources and navigating logistical/ethical complexities."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem identified in the task description and literature: the lack of cultural inclusivity in generative AI and its potential negative consequences (homogenization, marginalization). The proposed CCF, if successful, offers a systematic methodology to tackle this challenge, potentially leading to major advancements in AI fairness, evaluation, and cross-cultural HCI. It has the potential to influence AI development practices, improve global user experiences, contribute to cultural sustainability, and inform policy discussions, making substantial contributions to the field."
