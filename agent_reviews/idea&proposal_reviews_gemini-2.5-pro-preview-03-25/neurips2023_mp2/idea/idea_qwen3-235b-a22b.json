    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed for the workshop, including the application of moral philosophy to AI (using taxonomies), exploring alternatives to RLHF (proposing MARL-based aggregation), tackling the problem of missing pluralistic values, and investigating how to incorporate diverse voices and values into AI alignment to avoid amplifying monolithic views. The cross-disciplinary nature (AI/ML + moral philosophy) is central to the proposal, matching the workshop's theme."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is explicit, and the core concept of 'deliberative aggregation' using MARL with 'value agents' representing stakeholders is understandable. The contrast with RLHF is helpful. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific moral philosophy taxonomies to be used and the precise mechanics of the MARL negotiation process (how the 'dynamic equilibrium' is defined and achieved). However, the overall research direction and approach are well-defined."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While MARL and value alignment are existing fields, the specific proposal to frame alignment as a 'deliberative aggregation' process, explicitly modeling diverse stakeholder groups as negotiating agents within a MARL framework, and grounding this in moral philosophy taxonomies, offers a fresh perspective. It presents a distinct alternative to the common single-reward-model approach in RLHF, focusing on dynamic compromise between competing values rather than simple aggregation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Using philosophical taxonomies conceptually is feasible. Implementing MARL systems is technically possible but often complex, especially ensuring stable and meaningful negotiation dynamics. The primary challenge lies in accurately operationalizing diverse stakeholder values into agent objectives/rewards and ensuring these agents genuinely represent the nuances of those perspectives. Data collection or expert input for defining these agents would be demanding. Initial experiments in constrained domains (AVs, public health) are plausible, but scaling to complex real-world systems poses considerable hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical and increasingly urgent problem of value pluralism in AI alignment, addressing concerns about AI systems entrenching dominant values and excluding minority perspectives. Developing methods for AI to mediate value conflicts rather than imposing monolithic solutions could lead to major advancements in ethical AI. Success would offer a valuable alternative to current alignment techniques and contribute to building more equitable and trustworthy AI systems."
