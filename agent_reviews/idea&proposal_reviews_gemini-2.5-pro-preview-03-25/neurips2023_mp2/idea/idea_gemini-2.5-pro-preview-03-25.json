    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly asks 'What can theories of developmental moral psychology teach us about making AI?' and the core of the research idea is precisely the application of developmental moral psychology stages (like Kohlberg's) to train AI systems. It also addresses methodological questions about teaching AI values and potentially offers an alternative perspective to standard RLHF, another topic mentioned in the task description."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of static alignment), the core proposal (developmental scaffolding based on psychological stages), the mechanism (staged curriculum, varied data/signals, simulations), and the expected outcome (nuanced moral reasoning). The reference to Kohlberg's stages provides a concrete theoretical grounding. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While curriculum learning is an existing concept in ML, applying stages specifically derived from developmental moral psychology to AI value learning is innovative. It contrasts significantly with prevalent static alignment methods like RLHF and offers a fresh perspective grounded in psychological theory. It's a creative synthesis of ideas from different fields."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Translating abstract psychological stages (pre-conventional, conventional, post-conventional) into concrete training objectives, datasets, reward signals, and simulation environments is non-trivial. Designing simulations or curating data that accurately reflect the increasing complexity of moral reasoning at each stage requires considerable effort and careful design. Evaluating whether the AI has genuinely achieved a 'stage' of moral reasoning versus merely pattern-matching the training data for that stage is also a difficult validation problem. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation requires overcoming substantial hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and challenging problem of AI alignment and ethical AI development. If successful, creating AI systems that learn values in a more developmentally plausible way could lead to more robust, nuanced, context-aware, and potentially trustworthy AI. It offers a potential path beyond the limitations of current alignment techniques and could represent a major advancement in how we approach instilling values in AI."
