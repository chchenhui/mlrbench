        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme by applying a theory from moral psychology (Moral Foundations Theory) to AI practices (value alignment). It explicitly tackles several listed topics, including how psychologists can contribute to ethical AI, exploring alternatives to RLHF, addressing the lack of pluralistic values in current AI, and proposing methods to incorporate diverse voices and values into AI systems. The focus on pluralism, alternatives to RLHF, and integrating psychological theories makes it highly relevant."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (limitations of RLHF, need for pluralism) is explicitly stated. The proposed methodology (combining MFT, co-design workshops, participatory ranking, graph-based modeling, alignment constraints) is clearly outlined step-by-step. The expected outcomes (auditing toolkit, modular architecture) are specific. While the exact technical details of the graph-based model could be further elaborated in a full paper, the concept and overall workflow are immediately understandable and unambiguous for a proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While research exists on value alignment, participatory AI, and applying MFT, the specific combination of using MFT within co-design workshops to generate context-specific, weighted moral priorities, and then translating these via a graph-based model into dynamic AI alignment constraints, presents a novel approach. It offers a fresh perspective by decentralizing value specification and aiming for dynamic adaptation based on diverse value profiles, contrasting with typical RLHF implementations. The proposed mechanism for integrating participatory inputs directly into AI training constraints is innovative."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. The participatory component (co-design workshops, diverse stakeholder recruitment, managing deliberation, participatory ranking) is resource-intensive and complex to scale effectively while ensuring representative diversity. The technical component (formalizing qualitative values into quantitative weights, designing the graph-based model, translating weights into effective AI constraints, integrating these constraints into training/fine-tuning, evaluating the resulting alignment) requires substantial research and engineering effort. While conceptually sound, bridging the gap between participatory input and technical implementation poses considerable hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of value alignment in AI, particularly the risks of value homogenization and bias stemming from current methods like RLHF. Developing frameworks for systematically incorporating pluralistic values is crucial for creating equitable and trustworthy AI systems that serve diverse populations. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in AI ethics, provide practical tools for auditing and improving value alignment, and offer a viable alternative paradigm for aligning AI with complex human values."
