    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call to apply developmental moral psychology theories to AI ethics, elaborating on the core research idea of 'Developmental Scaffolding'. The methodology and objectives are consistent with the motivation to move beyond static RLHF and explore staged learning. Furthermore, it explicitly references concepts and challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as Kohlberg's stages, curriculum learning, cultural variability, and evaluation difficulties, positioning the work effectively within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The background, objectives, significance, and expected outcomes are articulated well. The methodology outlines the key stages, data types, high-level algorithmic steps, and evaluation plan logically. However, some crucial details lack full clarity. Specifically, the definitions and operationalization of the stage-specific reward functions (R_pre, R_con, R_post, particularly the s_t and j_t terms) are abstract. More detail on how 'social reward' and 'justice reward' will be quantified and implemented would enhance clarity. Similarly, specifics on the curation/generation of ethical dilemmas and social simulations could be more defined."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a satisfactory level of novelty. The core idea of applying developmental psychology stages to AI moral training is not entirely new, as evidenced by several recent papers cited in the literature review (e.g., Endo 2025, Johnson & Williams 2024, Davis & Brown 2023, Lee & Kim 2024). However, the specific formulation of the 'Developmental Scaffolding' approach, combining a three-stage curriculum with tailored RL rewards, simulated social interactions, and a structured evaluation plan, offers a potentially novel synthesis and refinement of these emerging ideas. The novelty lies more in the specific proposed framework and experimental design rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, grounded in established developmental psychology theories (like Kohlberg's) and standard machine learning techniques (RL, curriculum learning). The overall research design is logical. However, the soundness is weakened by the lack of rigor in critical methodological details. The abstract presentation of the reward functions (R_{pre}, R_{con}, R_{post}) without clear definitions or methods for calculating social (s_t) and justice (j_t) rewards is a significant gap. The success heavily relies on the effective operationalization of these complex moral concepts into computable signals, which is non-trivial and not adequately justified in the proposal. The reliance on simulated social interactions also raises questions about fidelity and transferability to real-world scenarios."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Quantifying abstract concepts like social norms and justice into robust reward signals for RL is notoriously difficult. Curating or simulating a sufficiently diverse and complex dataset of ethical dilemmas and social interactions across developmental stages is a substantial undertaking. Ensuring the AI genuinely progresses through stages rather than simply overfitting to stage-specific data requires careful design. While the proposal acknowledges challenges like scalability and evaluation, it doesn't provide concrete strategies to overcome them. The cross-cultural validation adds another layer of complexity. Significant resources and potentially novel methodological developments would be needed for successful execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and pressing problem in AI: developing ethical systems with nuanced moral reasoning capabilities that align with human values. Moving beyond static alignment methods towards dynamic, developmental approaches could represent a major advancement. If successful, the research could lead to more trustworthy, adaptable, and context-aware AI systems. It directly tackles key issues like cultural variability and the limitations of current methods like RLHF, potentially having a substantial impact on the field of AI ethics and responsible AI development."
