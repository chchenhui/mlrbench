    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for applying moral psychology (specifically developmental stages) to AI, explores alternatives/enhancements to RLHF, and considers the issue of monolithic vs. pluralistic values. It faithfully expands on the research idea of 'Developmental Scaffolding'. Furthermore, it effectively integrates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as using developmental approaches (Endo, Lee), considering cultural adaptability (Oliveira), and acknowledging limitations of current methods (Ganguli)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, the staged HRL methodology is explained with specific reward functions and algorithms (PPO, BERT integration), and the evaluation plan is detailed with metrics and baselines. The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the 'simulated social environments', the exact training process for the norm-scoring BERT model, and the details of the distillation process in Stage 3, but these do not significantly hinder understanding of the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the idea of applying developmental psychology to AI exists in the literature (as shown in the review), this proposal offers a novel formalization through a specific staged Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) framework. The combination of Kohlberg's stages, stage-specific reward engineering (integrating rule-based, norm-based, and principle-based rewards), and explicit testing for cultural adaptability using defined metrics constitutes a fresh approach compared to existing work on RLHF, IRL, or more general developmental concepts."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theories (Kohlberg) and methods (HRL, PPO). The methodology is generally well-defined, and the mathematical formulations for the reward functions are provided. However, operationalizing complex psychological stages into precise reward functions is inherently challenging and might oversimplify the concepts. The complexity of the Stage 3 reward function could pose tuning difficulties. While technically plausible, the reliance on synthesized/curated data for abstract stages and the effectiveness of a pre-trained BERT for nuanced norm-scoring introduce areas requiring further justification or empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While using standard frameworks like PyTorch and HuggingFace is practical, the core difficulty lies in curating or synthesizing high-quality, large-scale, stage-specific, and culturally diverse datasets, especially for the conventional and post-conventional stages. Training and tuning the complex staged HRL model will require substantial computational resources and expertise. Evaluating moral reasoning robustly, particularly OOD generalization and cross-cultural consistency, is also non-trivial. The ambition is high, and success depends heavily on overcoming the data and evaluation hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of AI alignment by proposing a more nuanced, developmentally inspired approach than current static methods like RLHF. Success could lead to major advancements in creating AI systems that are more ethically robust, context-aware, culturally adaptable, and capable of sophisticated moral reasoning. It directly tackles issues of monolithic value alignment and offers potential theoretical contributions bridging AI and moral psychology, alongside practical implications for deploying AI in sensitive domains."
