    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on applying developmental moral psychology to AI, explores alternatives to standard RLHF, considers value pluralism, and tackles AI alignment. It fully elaborates on the research idea of 'Developmental Scaffolding' using Kohlberg's stages. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the provided literature, citing relevant papers (Ganguli, Oliveira, Tennant, Endo, Lee & Kim) and acknowledging key challenges identified in the review, such as cultural variability and evaluation complexity."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It follows a logical structure, clearly articulating the background, objectives, significance, methodology, and expected outcomes. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the theoretical framework, technical implementation (architecture, loss functions, datasets, training procedures per stage, simulations, progression criteria), experimental design, and evaluation metrics. While some implementation details (e.g., precise formulation of stage-specific losses or simulation mechanics) would require further specification, the overall research plan is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the core idea of applying developmental psychology principles to AI ethics exists in the cited recent literature (Endo, Johnson, Davis, Lee & Kim, Martinez, White), this proposal offers a novel, comprehensive, and systematic framework (DSVA). Its novelty lies in the detailed, integrated methodology combining specific adaptations of Kohlberg's stages, stage-specific datasets and loss functions (integrating SFT and RL), simulated social environments tied to stages, explicit progression criteria, and a thorough evaluation plan. It represents a significant step beyond merely suggesting the developmental approach by providing a concrete, testable implementation strategy."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established developmental psychology theory (Kohlberg) and employs standard, appropriate machine learning techniques (Transformers, SFT, RL, RLHF). The proposed methodology, including staged training, specialized datasets, combined loss functions, and simulated environments, is logical and theoretically justified. The experimental design is comprehensive. Technical formulations are presented and appear generally correct, although some require further elaboration for implementation. Potential weaknesses lie in the inherent difficulty of operationalizing complex psychological concepts into ML terms and objectively evaluating moral reasoning, but the proposed approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial computational resources (large models), diverse expertise (ML, psychology, ethics), and extensive effort for dataset creation (especially culturally diverse, stage-specific data) and simulation development. The complexity of managing multi-stage training, integrating various components, and evaluating nuanced moral reasoning objectively is very high. While technically plausible with current methods within a well-resourced setting, the practical hurdles related to data, complexity, and evaluation make successful execution challenging and resource-intensive."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of AI value alignment, tackling limitations of current static approaches. By proposing a method for potentially achieving more nuanced, context-aware, and robust AI moral reasoning grounded in human development, it could lead to major advancements in AI safety and ethics. The potential to incorporate ethical pluralism and improve AI trustworthiness in high-stakes domains is substantial. Success would represent a significant contribution to AI alignment theory and practice."
