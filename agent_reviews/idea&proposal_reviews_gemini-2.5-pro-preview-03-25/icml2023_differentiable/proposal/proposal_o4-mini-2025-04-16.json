    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (making discrete optimization differentiable), the research idea (training-free, optimality-preserving via convex reformulation and KKT), and the literature review (addressing limitations like training needs and optimality loss of methods like Gumbel-Softmax, Birkhoff extensions, RL-based solvers). It directly tackles the core challenge outlined in the task description by proposing a specific method for obtaining gradients for non-differentiable combinatorial solvers, positioning itself clearly against existing approaches mentioned in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section logically progresses from problem formulation, through the core idea of parameterized convex reformulation and the use of KKT conditions for implicit differentiation, to the algorithmic pipeline and experimental design. Mathematical notations are used appropriately, and the overall structure makes the proposal easy to understand. The rationale and expected contributions are articulated concisely and without ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While implicit differentiation via KKT conditions is known (e.g., for differentiable convex layers) and convex reformulations exist in OR, the specific combination proposed here – using a parameterized convex reformulation with a penalty term explicitly designed to recover the *exact* discrete optimum, and then applying KKT-based implicit differentiation to get *exact gradients* in a *training-free* manner for general combinatorial optimization – appears innovative. It presents a distinct approach compared to prevalent relaxation-based (Gumbel-Softmax, Birkhoff) or learning-based (DIMES, GNNs) methods discussed in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely sound, built upon solid theoretical foundations of convex optimization (KKT conditions, convex hulls) and calculus (implicit function theorem). The core mechanism of using a strongly convex penalty to enforce integrality in the continuous relaxation and applying implicit differentiation is rigorous. However, the soundness score is slightly lowered because the proposal makes strong claims about the general applicability (finding F_hat, characterizing conv(Z), existence of rho_min ensuring x*=z*) without providing full justification or proof for arbitrary combinatorial problems. The practical existence and computability of such reformulations for all targeted problems (especially NP-hard ones) remain an assumption that needs further validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. While integrating a convex solver into PyTorch and using Hessian-vector products is standard, the core feasibility depends critically on: 1) The ability to efficiently solve the convex program `min G(x)` over `conv(Z)`. For many NP-hard problems, optimizing over the convex hull can be as hard or harder than solving the original discrete problem, potentially contradicting the claimed low overhead. 2) The difficulty of obtaining the necessary representation of `conv(Z)` (e.g., linear constraints `Ax <= b`), which can be complex or require exponentially many constraints. 3) The practical determination of the penalty `rho_min`. The feasibility seems higher for problems with known tractable convex hulls but questionable for harder, larger-scale instances without more details on how these challenges will be addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Addressing the challenge of differentiating combinatorial optimization components without sacrificing optimality or requiring training data is crucial for integrating OR techniques into end-to-end learning systems. Success would represent a major advancement over existing relaxation or stochastic methods, potentially enabling breakthroughs in areas like logistics, scheduling, network design, and resource allocation where both learning and optimal discrete decisions are needed. The potential impact on both the ML and OR communities is substantial."
