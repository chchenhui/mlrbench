        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task (making discrete combinatorial optimization differentiable where vanilla AD fails), precisely follows the proposed research idea (training-free, KKT-based implicit differentiation, optimality preservation focus), and positions itself clearly against methods discussed in the literature review (relaxations like Gumbel-Softmax, learning-based solvers like DIMES), aiming to overcome identified challenges like solution quality and training data dependence."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The core methodology (convex reformulation, KKT conditions, implicit differentiation) is explained with mathematical formulations and a high-level algorithm. However, some key aspects lack sufficient detail: 1) The exact conditions under which the solution to the regularized continuous problem x^*(\\theta) coincides with the original discrete optimum need explicit statement and justification beyond 'mild conditions'. 2) The practical construction of the convex hull \\\\text{conv}(\\\\mathcal{X}) for general COPs like Max-Cut or Graph Coloring is not detailed. 3) Potential numerical issues like the invertibility of the KKT Jacobian J are not discussed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While implicit differentiation via KKT conditions has been explored for optimization layers, its specific application here—combining convex reformulation (hull + regularization) with KKT-based implicit differentiation for *training-free* gradient computation in COPs, explicitly aiming to *preserve discrete optimality*—represents a novel approach. It clearly distinguishes itself from dominant relaxation-based (Gumbel, DOMAC) and learning-based (DIMES, GNNs) methods highlighted in the literature by avoiding explicit relaxations during solving and eliminating the need for training data."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is based on sound mathematical principles (convex optimization, KKT conditions, implicit function theorem). However, there are significant soundness concerns regarding the core claims and methodology: 1) The claim of 'preserving optimality' is critical but potentially fragile. Adding a regularizer \\\\lambda \\\\Gamma(x) changes the objective; rigorous proof is needed to show the solution x^*(\\theta) corresponds to the *original* discrete optimum, and under what specific conditions (problem types, properties of f, choice of \\\\lambda). This is mentioned as an expected outcome but needs stronger upfront justification. 2) The reliance on the convex hull \\\\text{conv}(\\\\mathcal{X}) is theoretically sound but practically challenging, as constructing it is often NP-hard. The proposal doesn't adequately address how this will be handled for problems beyond TSP (e.g., Max-Cut, Coloring). 3) Conditions for the invertibility of the KKT Jacobian, crucial for the implicit function theorem, are not discussed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Using standard convex solvers (CVXPY, ADMM) and auto-diff for implicit gradients is feasible for moderate sizes. However, major hurdles exist: 1) Constructing or representing the exact convex hull for many COPs is computationally prohibitive. Using known polyhedral relaxations might compromise the 'exact optimality' claim. 2) The O(n^3) complexity for dense KKT Jacobian inversion limits scalability. While sparsity or iterative methods might help, this isn't detailed, making the claimed scalability (e.g., 1000-node Max-Cut faster than DIMES) seem ambitious and requiring strong empirical validation. The feasibility hinges heavily on efficiently handling the convex hull and the KKT system solve for the target problem sizes."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: enabling gradient-based learning through exact combinatorial solvers without requiring training data or compromising optimality. Success would represent a major advancement over existing relaxation or learning-based methods, particularly for high-stakes applications (logistics, resource allocation, scheduling) requiring certified optimality or operating in data-scarce environments. The potential impact on integrating optimization and learning, and enabling new forms of self-supervision, is substantial."
