    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of limitations in existing sequence models (SSMs, Transformers) regarding memory and long-range dependencies. It falls squarely within several listed topics, including 'Memory' (long-range correlations, long context), 'Improving architectures', and 'Recurrent neural networks and state-space models'. It also touches upon efficiency ('reasonable computational requirements') and potential improvements for 'Reasoning' via better memory utilization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the core components (dual memory system, memory controllers, RL optimization, integration with SSMs) are outlined. However, the specifics of the mechanisms lack detail. For instance, how the 'learnable, parameterized cache' works, the exact 'selective compression' method, the nature of 'importance signals', and the precise RL formulation (state, action, reward) are not fully defined. While the overall concept is understandable, these ambiguities prevent it from being crystal clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While external memory mechanisms and RL for control aren't entirely new concepts in sequence modeling, their specific integration proposed here – a dual (working/long-term) memory system with learnable controllers optimized via RL, specifically designed to augment modern State Space Models (SSMs) for extreme sequence lengths – offers a fresh perspective. It combines existing concepts in a non-trivial way to address a contemporary challenge in sequence modeling, moving beyond standard attention or recurrent state mechanisms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating SSMs, a differentiable dual-memory system, and an RL-based controller is complex. Training such a system could be unstable and computationally expensive, requiring careful reward shaping and hyperparameter tuning for the RL component. Ensuring the 'selective compression' is effective yet efficient, and achieving the target of 100K+ tokens with 'reasonable computational requirements' is ambitious and requires substantial engineering effort and empirical validation. While plausible using current techniques, it's a high-risk, high-reward endeavor."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Effectively managing memory and long-range dependencies over extreme sequence lengths (100K+ tokens) remains a major bottleneck for current sequence models. Successfully developing such a mechanism would represent a substantial advancement, enabling better performance on tasks involving very long documents, code analysis, extended dialogues, or biological sequences. It addresses a critical and widely recognized problem in the field, aligning well with the workshop's focus on next-generation architectures."
