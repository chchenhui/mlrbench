        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea aligns excellently with the task description (ICML Workshop on Next Gen Sequence Models). It directly addresses limitations of State Space Models (SSMs), a key topic ('Recurrent neural networks and state-space models'). It focuses on improving SSMs ('Improving architectures') for continuous learning, which relates to 'Memory', 'Generalization' (robustness over time), and handling long sequences/streams effectively. The problem of catastrophic forgetting and state management is central to the challenges discussed for sequence models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear. The motivation (SSMs struggle with continuous learning) is well-stated. The proposed solution (adaptive state reset mechanism via a learned gate triggered by state dynamics/uncertainty) is clearly defined. The evaluation plan (streaming benchmarks, comparison) and expected outcomes (more stable/adaptive SSMs) are explicitly mentioned. The language is precise and easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While continual learning and state management are known problems, applying an *adaptive*, *learned* state reset mechanism specifically *within* modern SSM architectures like Mamba to mitigate catastrophic forgetting appears relatively unexplored. It combines concepts (gating, state monitoring, continual learning) in a specific way tailored to SSMs' state dynamics, differentiating it from typical continual learning approaches focused on parameter updates or simple replay. It's not a completely new paradigm but a novel architectural modification for a specific challenge."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Implementing a gating mechanism is standard. Monitoring state dynamics (e.g., norms, changes) is straightforward. Monitoring prediction uncertainty is also feasible, though potentially more complex depending on the method chosen. Integrating this into existing SSM codebases is achievable with moderate engineering effort. Training requires careful setup but relies on standard deep learning techniques. Suitable benchmark datasets exist. No fundamental technological barriers are apparent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. SSMs are increasingly important sequence models. Enabling them to perform robustly in continuous learning settings, where data arrives sequentially and distributions may shift, would greatly expand their practical applicability to real-world streaming data problems (e.g., time series, robotics, monitoring). Mitigating catastrophic forgetting is a critical challenge in lifelong learning. Success would represent a meaningful advancement for both SSMs and continual learning."
