    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the ICML workshop (memory, long-range context, scalability, improving architectures, SSMs) and the key challenges identified in the literature review (memory retention/access, efficiency, adaptive management, scalability). The proposed AHM-SSM architecture is a direct and detailed elaboration of the research idea, integrating the SSM backbone with the dual memory system and learnable controllers. It correctly positions itself relative to cited works like Mamba, S4, SMR, and LMNs, aiming to overcome their limitations for extreme sequence lengths (100K+)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure with distinct sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The problem statement is concise, the proposed AHM-SSM architecture and its components (SSM, WM, LTM, controllers) are explained clearly, and the research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section details the architecture, the RL-based optimization strategy for controllers, data sources, and a comprehensive experimental plan including baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Potential challenges are also clearly articulated with mitigation strategies. Minor ambiguities exist only at the level of fine-grained implementation details, which is expected for a proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While leveraging existing concepts like SSMs (Mamba), external memory, and RL, the specific combination into an Adaptive Hierarchical Memory system (WM/LTM) managed by learned controllers optimized via RL for extreme long-range sequence understanding (100K+ tokens) is novel. It distinguishes itself from standard SSMs lacking external memory, memory-augmented RNNs/Transformers with different backbones/scalability, and recent related works like SMR (different focus) or LMNs (different memory structure/mechanism). The use of RL for dynamic, task-aware memory management within this specific SSM-based architecture is a key innovative aspect."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon strong foundations: efficient SSMs (Mamba) and established concepts of memory augmentation and reinforcement learning. The rationale for combining these components to address the problem is logical. The proposed methodology, including the architecture design, the RL framework for controller optimization (state, action, reward, algorithm choices), and the extensive evaluation plan (benchmarks, baselines, ablations, scalability analysis), is well-reasoned and technically plausible. The proposal acknowledges potential technical challenges (RL stability, computational overhead) and suggests reasonable mitigation strategies. The technical descriptions are appropriate for a proposal, indicating a solid understanding."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the individual components (SSM, memory modules, RL controllers) can be implemented using existing frameworks, integrating them into a stable and efficient system is complex. Training the RL controller effectively, especially with potentially sparse rewards and long sequences, is known to be difficult and requires significant expertise and tuning. Furthermore, experimenting with extreme sequence lengths (100K+) demands substantial computational resources (high-memory GPUs, extensive training time), which might be a bottleneck. The proposal acknowledges these challenges, but their successful mitigation is not guaranteed, making the overall feasibility satisfactory rather than good or excellent."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized bottleneck in sequence modeling: effective processing and memory management over extreme sequence lengths. Success would represent a major advancement, enabling deeper understanding of long documents, codebases, biological sequences, etc. This could unlock new applications in various fields (long-form generation, complex QA, scientific discovery). The research directly contributes to the goals of the target workshop and has the potential to influence future sequence model architectures, offering a more scalable alternative to pure attention for ultra-long contexts."
