        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop task (memory, long-range context, efficiency, scalability, improving architectures) by proposing a solution for limitations in current sequence models (SSMs, Transformers). It elaborates coherently on the research idea (dual memory, RL controllers). Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review (memory retention, efficiency, adaptive memory, scalability, generalization) and positions the work relative to recent advancements in SSMs and memory mechanisms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is partially clear but has some ambiguities. The overall goal, objectives, and high-level architecture are understandable. However, the methodology lacks specific technical details. The descriptions of the working memory (RNN-based?), long-term memory (compression mechanism?), and memory controllers are high-level. The mathematical formulation is very abstract, leaving key functions like 'Gate', 'Compress', and 'Memory Controller' undefined. The specifics of the RL implementation (state/action space, reward function) are missing. The precise interaction between the base SSM (mentioned in intro/conclusion) and the proposed memory components needs clarification."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While external memory systems and RL for optimization exist, the specific combination of a dual-memory architecture (dynamic working memory + selectively compressed long-term store) integrated with State Space Models and controlled by learnable, RL-optimized memory controllers for operations like storing, compressing, retrieving, and discarding based on downstream task performance appears novel. It distinguishes itself from cited works like SMR, LMNs, or basic Mamba extensions by proposing a more complex, adaptive memory management system specifically tailored for extreme sequence lengths."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has gaps in rigor. The motivation is well-founded, and the high-level concept of combining SSMs with external memory controlled by RL is plausible. However, the methodology lacks technical depth. The mathematical formulation is too abstract to verify correctness. The RL approach (Q-learning) is mentioned but without details on state/action/reward design, raising questions about its practical application and stability for complex memory control. The choice of an RNN for working memory seems potentially contradictory to the goal of leveraging SSM strengths unless its role or design is clarified. Claims about handling 100K+ tokens lack concrete justification regarding the scalability of the proposed memory access and RL mechanisms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating a dual-memory system, potentially involving complex compression schemes, with an SSM backbone is non-trivial. Adding RL controllers for fine-grained memory operations introduces substantial complexity in implementation, training (potential instability, reward shaping), and debugging. Training and evaluating on 100K+ token sequences requires significant computational resources. While the components exist individually, their successful integration into a stable, scalable, and effective system poses considerable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged limitation of current sequence models: effective memory and reasoning over very long contexts. Successfully enhancing memory retention and adaptive management for sequences of 100K+ tokens would represent a major advancement, potentially transforming performance on tasks requiring deep contextual understanding (long-form generation, document analysis, bioinformatics) and enabling more efficient processing of extensive sequential data across various domains."
