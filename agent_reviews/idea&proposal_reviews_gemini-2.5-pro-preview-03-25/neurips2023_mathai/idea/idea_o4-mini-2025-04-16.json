        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Measuring mathematical reasoning: How do we design benchmarks which accurately evaluate mathematical reasoning abilities, especially in an era of large language models?'. This proposal directly addresses this need by suggesting a dynamic benchmark system specifically designed to overcome the limitations of static benchmarks (saturation, overfitting) for evaluating AI, particularly LLMs, in mathematical reasoning. It tackles the core theme of the workshop regarding the extent to which machines can comprehend mathematics by proposing a more robust evaluation method."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem with existing benchmarks. The main idea outlines a specific closed-loop pipeline involving concrete tools (Lean, LLMs), processes (generate, prove, verify), domains (algebra, analysis, combinatorics), and a method for difficulty calibration (tags). The expected outcomes and overall goals are explicitly stated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity, providing a strong foundation for research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using LLMs with proof assistants and creating math benchmarks are existing research areas, the core novelty lies in proposing a *dynamic*, *closed-loop*, and *self-generating* benchmark system. This 'living benchmark' concept, designed to continuously produce new, verified, and difficulty-calibrated problems using a neuro-symbolic approach to combat overfitting and assess deeper generalization, represents a significant innovation over traditional static datasets. The integration of generation, proving, and verification directly into the benchmark creation process is a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core components (LLMs, Lean, formal libraries) exist. However, reliably integrating LLMs with proof assistants for automated theorem generation and proof sketching at scale is technically demanding. Ensuring the generated theorems are non-trivial and diverse, automatically drafting useful proof sketches, robustly verifying/refining them in Lean, and accurately calibrating difficulty requires substantial research and engineering effort. Building and maintaining the continuous closed-loop pipeline is ambitious. It requires significant expertise and computational resources, making it challenging but plausible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Evaluating the true mathematical reasoning capabilities of advanced AI models like LLMs is a critical challenge, as current static benchmarks are increasingly susceptible to saturation and overfitting. A successful dynamic, adaptive benchmark as proposed could provide a much more reliable measure of genuine progress, pushing the field towards developing AI with deeper mathematical understanding rather than superficial pattern matching. It addresses a key bottleneck identified in the task description and could become a standard evaluation tool, thus having a major impact on AI research in mathematics and related fields."
