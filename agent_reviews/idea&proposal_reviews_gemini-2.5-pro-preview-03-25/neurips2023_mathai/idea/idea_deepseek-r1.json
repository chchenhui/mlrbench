    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Measuring mathematical reasoning: How do we design benchmarks which accurately evaluate mathematical reasoning abilities, especially in an era of large language models?'. The proposed idea directly addresses this by designing a novel benchmark focused on evaluating the depth (step-by-step reasoning) and generalization of mathematical reasoning in AI, moving beyond existing benchmarks that primarily focus on final answer correctness. It fits squarely within the workshop's theme and guiding question."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation highlights the limitations of current benchmarks effectively. The main components of the proposed benchmark (context-rich problems, dynamic difficulty, distractors, cross-disciplinary prompts) are specific and clearly articulated. The evaluation methodology (human annotation of steps) and goals (quantifying gaps, proposing training strategies, public benchmark) are explicitly stated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While evaluating mathematical reasoning is not new, existing popular benchmarks (MATH, GSM8K) primarily score final answers. This proposal focuses on evaluating the *process* (step-by-step validity) and *generalization* in a structured way. The combination of context-rich problems, dynamic difficulty, distractor tasks designed to probe logical justification, and cross-disciplinary prompts within a single benchmark framework represents a novel and holistic approach compared to current standards. It moves beyond typical competition-style problems towards assessing deeper understanding."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Creating high-quality, context-rich, multi-step problems across different domains and difficulty levels is resource-intensive. The most challenging aspect is the reliable annotation of step-by-step reasoning, which requires considerable expert human effort, clear guidelines, and potentially complex inter-annotator agreement protocols. Designing effective distractors and sourcing cross-disciplinary problems also adds complexity. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation requires substantial resources (time, funding, diverse expertise) and careful planning to execute successfully."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Accurately evaluating *how* AI models reason mathematically, rather than just checking final answers, is crucial for understanding their true capabilities, limitations, and trustworthiness. Such a benchmark could drive progress towards models with more robust and generalizable reasoning skills, essential for applications in science, engineering, education, and safety-critical systems. It addresses a well-recognized gap in current evaluation methodologies and could provide valuable insights for the AI research community, guiding future model development."
