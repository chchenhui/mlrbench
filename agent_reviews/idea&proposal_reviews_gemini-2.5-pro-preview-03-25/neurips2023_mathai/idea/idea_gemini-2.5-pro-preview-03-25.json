        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly asks 'How do we design benchmarks which accurately evaluate mathematical reasoning abilities, especially in an era of large language models?'. The proposed idea directly addresses this question by suggesting a method for generating adversarial benchmarks to ensure robust evaluation and mitigate issues like data contamination and memorization. It fits squarely within one of the key focus areas outlined for the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (benchmark saturation), the core mechanism (generator/solver LLMs), the process (iterative refinement), and the goal (robust, dynamic benchmark targeting weaknesses) are well-explained. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanisms for iterative refinement and how specific 'known weaknesses' are targeted systematically, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using LLMs for data generation or employing adversarial methods isn't entirely new, applying an adversarial LLM framework specifically to generate challenging mathematical reasoning problems for benchmarking is innovative. It moves beyond static, human-curated benchmarks towards a dynamic, self-improving system designed to counter LLM memorization and probe deeper reasoning. This specific application and framing are novel."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires access to capable LLMs and expertise in controlling their generation and evaluation capabilities. Key challenges include ensuring the generated problems are mathematically sound, genuinely solvable by humans, appropriately difficult, and effectively target specific reasoning weaknesses without being overly contrived. Significant engineering effort and potentially substantial computational resources would be needed, but it is within the realm of current ML research capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Evaluating the true mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, beyond pattern matching or memorization, is a critical challenge for the field. Existing benchmarks face obsolescence due to training data contamination. This proposal addresses this fundamental issue by aiming to create robust, dynamic benchmarks. Success would lead to more reliable evaluations, guide future model development towards genuine understanding, and significantly contribute to answering the workshop's central theme about AI comprehending mathematics."
