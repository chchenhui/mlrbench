        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of ML models comprehending mathematics and potential applications by focusing on explainable mathematical reasoning using LLMs. It elaborates precisely on the research idea of integrating LLMs with dynamically constructed knowledge graphs for transparency and robustness. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, referencing relevant papers on LLM+KG integration, mathematical benchmarks, and explicitly tackling key challenges like explainability, multi-step reasoning, and hallucinations identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to a detailed methodology and expected impact. Key concepts like the EMG-LLM architecture, Dynamic Mathematical Knowledge Graph (DMKG), and KG Interaction Module (KIM) are clearly explained. Research objectives are specific and measurable. The algorithmic steps for the reasoning loop are presented logically. While fine-grained implementation details (e.g., exact KG schema, parsing rules) are not fully specified, this is appropriate for a proposal, and the overall approach is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While integrating LLMs and KGs is an active research area (as shown in the literature review, e.g., Luo et al., Li et al.), the core novelty lies in the proposed *dynamic* construction and validation loop using a KG specifically tailored to represent the evolving state of a *mathematical problem-solving process*. This differs from cited works often focused on querying static KGs for factual grounding (KGQA) or proof generation with potentially different KG interaction models. The emphasis on using this dynamically built graph for step-by-step validation and generating inherent explanations for general mathematical reasoning problems presents a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon the established principle of using structured knowledge (KGs) to ground LLM reasoning. The proposed hybrid architecture (EMG-LLM) and the iterative reasoning loop involving LLM proposal, KIM validation, and DMKG update are methodologically coherent. The inclusion of validation checks (definitions, preconditions, symbolic verification via SymPy) is appropriate for mathematical reasoning. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant metrics and baselines. Minor weaknesses include the inherent difficulty in creating a perfectly robust parser/validator and a universally applicable mathematical KG schema, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technologies (LLMs, KG libraries, symbolic math engines) and publicly available datasets. However, it presents significant engineering challenges. Developing the KG Interaction Module (KIM) to accurately parse diverse LLM outputs, perform robust validation against the dynamic KG, and manage the graph updates efficiently is complex. Defining a flexible yet effective KG schema for various mathematical domains requires careful design. The project requires substantial computational resources and expertise in LLMs, KGs, and mathematical reasoning. While achievable, the implementation complexity poses moderate risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of explainability and trustworthiness in LLM-based mathematical reasoning. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially enabling reliable use of AI in critical areas like education (explainable tutoring), scientific research (verifiable derivations), and finance (transparent modeling). By aiming to produce verifiable reasoning traces, it directly tackles core limitations of current LLMs (opacity, hallucinations) and aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of understanding AI's mathematical comprehension and its applications. The potential impact is substantial."
