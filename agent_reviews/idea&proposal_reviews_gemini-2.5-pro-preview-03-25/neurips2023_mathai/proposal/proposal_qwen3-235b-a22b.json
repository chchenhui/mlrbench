    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core theme of LLMs and mathematical reasoning, focusing on comprehension (via structured reasoning), new capabilities (explainable AI), benchmarking (proposing new metrics), and applications (education, formal verification). It faithfully implements the research idea of using dynamic KGs integrated with LLMs for explainability. Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant KG+LLM works (KG-GPT, RoG), benchmarks (U-MATH, ProofNet, MathBench, FrontierMath), and explicitly aims to tackle key challenges identified in the review, such as explainability, multi-step reasoning, and hallucinations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with motivation and objectives, detailing the methodology (graph construction, LLM integration, training, evaluation), and outlining expected outcomes and impact. Key concepts like the dynamic reasoning graph, node/edge types, integration mechanisms (prompting, attention modification, graph updates), loss functions, and evaluation metrics are clearly explained. The objectives are specific and measurable. While some implementation details could be further elaborated in a full paper (e.g., precise computation of L_EX), the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While integrating KGs with LLMs for reasoning isn't entirely new (citing KG-GPT, RoG), this proposal's emphasis on *dynamic* graph construction *during* the reasoning process, specifically tailored for mathematical problem-solving, offers a fresh perspective. The explicit focus on explainability as a core objective, reinforced by a dedicated explainability loss function (L_EX) and specific explainability metrics (Coverage, Consistency, Modularity), distinguishes it from prior work that might mention interpretability more broadly. The proposed hybrid architecture and integration with formal math libraries (Lean, Coq) further contribute to its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (LLMs, KGs, attention, formal methods). The methodology is well-reasoned, combining established techniques (embedding similarity, prompt engineering, cross-entropy loss) with plausible innovations (graph-based attention, dynamic updates, specialized loss functions). The inclusion of a Graph Consistency Loss (L_GC) potentially using a theorem prover like Coq adds significant rigor, as does the plan to evaluate hallucination rates via formal verification. The Explainability Loss (L_EX) based on mutual information is theoretically grounded, although its practical estimation and optimization present challenges. Overall, the approach is technically well-founded, with minor areas (like L_EX implementation details) needing further specification."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core components (LLM fine-tuning, KG manipulation, basic integration) are achievable with current technology. However, the dynamic nature of the graph construction needs careful and efficient engineering. Integrating formal theorem provers (like Coq for L_GC or verification) can be computationally very expensive and complex to implement robustly within a training loop or evaluation pipeline. Estimating and optimizing the mutual information-based L_EX loss is non-trivial. The evaluation plan, involving potentially manual validation for the Consistency metric (S) and formal checks for Hallucination Rate (HR), could be resource-intensive. Scalability is correctly identified as a risk. While conceptually sound, the practical realization requires considerable effort and expertise, pushing the boundaries of current practical implementations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in current AI systems â€“ the lack of explainability and reliability in complex reasoning tasks, particularly in the fundamental domain of mathematics. Improving transparency and reducing errors in mathematical reasoning LLMs has profound implications for trustworthiness in high-stakes applications like education (personalized tutoring, curriculum development), scientific research (proof assistance, discovery), and formal verification. Success would represent a major step towards more reliable and collaborative AI, establishing a valuable framework for hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning and potentially setting new standards for evaluating explainability in this domain."
