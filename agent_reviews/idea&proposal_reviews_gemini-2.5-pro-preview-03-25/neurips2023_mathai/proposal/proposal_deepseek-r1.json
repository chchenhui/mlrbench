    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on LLMs and mathematical reasoning, particularly concerning AI comprehension, new capabilities (hybrid LLM-KG), evaluation (benchmarks), and applications (education, science). It faithfully implements the research idea of using dynamic KGs for explainable mathematical reasoning. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the provided literature, citing relevant papers (KG-GPT, RoG, KG-Trie concept) and benchmarks (ProofNet, U-MATH, MathBench, PutnamBench), while explicitly aiming to tackle the identified key challenges like explainability, multi-step reasoning, and hallucinations. The objectives and methodology are directly derived from these inputs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall system design (KGC and LLM-KG Engine), data sources, and evaluation plan are presented logically. However, some technical details within the methodology lack full specification. For instance, the precise mechanism of using KG-Trie for validating mathematical steps, the exact formulation and tuning of the attention modification term (lambda * A_G), the specifics of the contrastive decoding for corrections, and the RL reward function design could be elaborated further. While the overall structure and intent are clear, these specific points introduce minor ambiguities requiring refinement for complete understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing work integrating LLMs and KGs (like KG-GPT, RoG, GCR cited in the literature review), it proposes a specific and novel approach focused on *dynamically* constructing mathematical reasoning graphs during the problem-solving process. This dynamic aspect, tailored to capture step-by-step mathematical logic, distinguishes it from approaches potentially using more static KGs. The proposed integration method, including the specific attention mechanism modification incorporating graph structure and the use of KG-Trie for validation within this dynamic mathematical context, offers a fresh perspective. The focus on generating interpretable graphs for complex mathematical reasoning on challenging, recent benchmarks further enhances its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of LLMs, KGs, and neuro-symbolic AI. The motivation is strong, and the proposed methodology (dynamic KG construction, LLM-KG integration, step-by-step reasoning) is logical and leverages recent techniques (KG-Trie). The experimental design is appropriate, including relevant baselines, standard accuracy metrics, and suitable explainability measures (FVI, human evaluation) on challenging benchmarks. However, the soundness score is slightly moderated because some technical formulations lack full detail and rigorous justification (e.g., the specific form of the attention modification, the precise adaptation of KG-Trie for mathematical validation, the RL reward function). While plausible, the effectiveness of these specific components requires empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current SOTA LLMs, KG techniques, and computational resources, assuming adequate access. The plan is generally realistic. However, there are non-trivial implementation challenges. Developing a robust dynamic Knowledge Graph Constructor (KGC) for diverse mathematical reasoning, effectively adapting and implementing the KG-Trie validation, successfully fine-tuning the LLM with a complex RL objective involving graph consistency, and carefully tuning the LLM-KG integration mechanism require significant expertise and effort. The ambitious performance improvement targets (15-20% on PutnamBench) also add to the challenge. While achievable, these factors indicate moderate implementation risks and complexity."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning: their lack of explainability and susceptibility to errors in complex, multi-step problems. Improving transparency and reliability in AI-driven mathematical reasoning is crucial for trust and adoption in high-stakes domains like scientific research, engineering, finance, and education. The potential contributions – a novel explainable reasoning framework, improved accuracy, interpretable reasoning traces, and applications in education and science – are substantial. Success would represent a major advancement in trustworthy AI and directly contribute to the core questions posed by the workshop task description."
