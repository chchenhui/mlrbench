        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of understanding pre-training data's influence on emergent capabilities and representation learning. The methodology faithfully operationalizes the research idea of using representation perturbation to probe data subset influence. Furthermore, it explicitly references key papers from the literature review (Du et al., Wei et al.) and aims to tackle the challenges identified therein (identifying critical data, perturbation techniques, measuring impact, causal inference, data curation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes, Conclusion) with clearly stated objectives. The methodology section details the steps for clustering, perturbation, evaluation, and experimental design, including mathematical formulations. The rationale and significance are well-articulated. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for task-specific cluster filtering using attention heads (S2.1.3) and the full interpretation of 'subspace drift' using Mahalanobis distance, but these do not significantly impede overall understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While utilizing existing techniques like representation clustering (DBSCAN) and gradient-based analysis, the core novelty lies in their specific combination and application: systematically linking unsupervised data clusters in representation space to specific emergent capabilities using targeted, cluster-associated representation perturbations as a causal probe. This approach offers a more fine-grained, causally-oriented investigation into the data-capability link compared to studies focusing solely on scale, overall loss, or correlational analyses. The proposed framework for quantifying data subset influence via controlled perturbation is a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established concepts of foundation models, representation learning, and emergent phenomena. The methodology employs reasonable techniques (DBSCAN, gradient-based perturbation, standard benchmarks like GSM8K, representation analysis metrics). The inclusion of control groups, ablation studies, and multiple base models strengthens the experimental design. Technical formulations are generally correct. Minor weaknesses include the potential sensitivity of DBSCAN, the simplification introduced by using `sign` for perturbation direction, and the need for careful validation of the causal claims derived from perturbations. However, the overall approach is methodologically coherent and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and standard FM research infrastructure (access to models, datasets, compute). The core techniques (embedding extraction, clustering, gradient computation, model evaluation) are implementable. However, the project involves significant computational cost and engineering complexity, particularly in handling large datasets, performing extensive clustering, and running numerous perturbation experiments. Potential challenges include the effectiveness of clustering in high dimensions, controlling for confounding effects of perturbations, and the potential noisiness of results, making successful execution non-trivial but achievable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical, unresolved question in FM research: how specific pre-training data drives emergent capabilities like reasoning. Successfully establishing these causal links would be a major advancement in understanding FMs. The potential practical implications are substantial, including developing data-efficient pre-training strategies (reducing cost and environmental impact) and enabling targeted interventions for alignment and bias mitigation by manipulating representations associated with problematic data clusters. The research directly contributes to the workshop's goals of rigorous characterization and responsible FM development."
