    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding pre-training data's role ('What subsets of the data are most important...'), emergent capabilities, and representation learning. It systematically elaborates the core research idea (linking data subsets to emergent abilities via representation perturbation) and incorporates insights and challenges identified in the literature review (e.g., referencing Wei et al. on emergence, Du et al. on loss thresholds, Aghajanyan et al. on multi-task representations, and acknowledging challenges in data identification and perturbation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context and motivation effectively. The objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology is broken down into logical phases (Data Clustering, Representation Analysis, Perturbation, Impact Assessment), each with clear goals and described methods, including specific techniques and mathematical formalisms where appropriate (e.g., clustering definition, association score S(i,k), AIS). The experimental setup, expected outcomes, and impact are also clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like data clustering, representation analysis (probing, activation analysis), and model perturbation exist, the novelty lies in their systematic integration to establish causal links between diverse pre-training data *subsets* and specific *emergent* abilities through targeted *representation interventions*. It moves beyond correlational studies or analysis of overall training dynamics (like Du et al.) by proposing a specific mechanism (data -> representation subspace -> capability) and a method to test it causally. The focus on perturbing data-associated representations to understand emergent abilities is a fresh perspective compared to standard interpretability or fine-tuning studies."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on plausible hypotheses about the role of data in shaping representations for specific capabilities. The methodology employs established techniques (LDA, SVD, probing classifiers, standard benchmarks like GSM8K, MMLU) appropriately. The inclusion of multiple perturbation types (ablation, noise, directional shifts) and validation steps strengthens the approach. The plan for control experiments and quantitative impact assessment (AIS, Data Influence Matrix) adds rigor. Minor weaknesses include the potential difficulty in perfectly isolating data-cluster-specific representations and ensuring perturbations don't have broad, unintended consequences, though validation steps aim to mitigate this. The mathematical formulations are clear and appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial computational resources (multiple high-end GPUs) for experiments on large models (LLaMA 70B) and datasets (The Pile). The technical complexity is high, involving large-scale data processing, sophisticated representation analysis across multiple layers, development of a flexible perturbation framework, and extensive evaluation. Identifying clean associations between broad data clusters and specific representation components might be difficult. While using open-source models/datasets and existing libraries helps, the overall scope is very ambitious and requires significant expertise and time. Success depends heavily on access to resources and overcoming potential technical hurdles in the analysis and perturbation steps."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental, critical gap in understanding foundation models: how specific pre-training data contributes to the emergence of complex capabilities. Successfully establishing these causal links would be a major advancement in FM science. The potential impact is substantial, offering insights for more efficient training, targeted data curation, better model alignment (by understanding data sources of desired/undesired behaviors), improved interpretability, and potentially informing strategies for mitigating biases or harmful capabilities originating from specific data."
