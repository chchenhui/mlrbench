    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding pre-training data's influence on emergent capabilities, a key topic mentioned under 'Pre-Training' and 'Emergent phenomena'. The methodology precisely follows the research idea of using representation perturbation linked to data clusters to probe emergent abilities. It effectively incorporates and builds upon the cited literature, acknowledging key papers on emergent abilities and loss perspectives, and explicitly aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as identifying critical data subsets and applying causal inference."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and easy to understand. The methodology is broken down into logical, detailed steps (data clustering, representation analysis, perturbation techniques, experimental design), including specific algorithms (Sentence-BERT, BERTopic, probing classifiers), mathematical formulations (neuron importance, ACE, perturbation equations), models (LLaMA-2, GPT-NeoX), tasks (GSM8K, BIG-Bench), and evaluation metrics. The structure is logical, and the language is precise, making the research plan readily comprehensible with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the individual techniques (data clustering, representation probing, model perturbation, causal mediation analysis) are not entirely new, their specific combination and application to systematically map pre-training data cluster influence to specific emergent abilities via targeted representation manipulation is innovative. It moves beyond correlational studies towards a more causal understanding, which is a novel approach in this specific context of dissecting emergent abilities based on data origins. The novelty lies more in the synthesis and targeted application rather than the invention of fundamentally new methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established concepts (representation learning, emergent abilities, probing, causal inference) and relevant literature. The proposed methodology employs standard and appropriate techniques (clustering, logistic regression/MLP probes, ablation, projection, gradient perturbation, causal mediation framework). The experimental design includes relevant models, tasks, control variables, and validation metrics. The technical formulations appear correct. A minor weakness lies in the inherent assumptions when applying causal mediation analysis to complex neural representations and linking probe-identified neurons directly to causal mechanisms for downstream tasks, but the approach itself is methodologically valid."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical and resource challenges. Access to large models (LLaMA-2, GPT-NeoX) and substantial computational resources for clustering, training probes, performing perturbations, and evaluating across multiple configurations is essential. Implementing perturbation techniques effectively without degrading general model performance requires careful tuning. While the steps are logical, the scale of the experiments and the complexity of the analysis (especially causal mediation in high dimensions) make it ambitious. The proposal acknowledges some risks (confounding clusters, over-perturbation) and suggests mitigations, indicating awareness of potential difficulties."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and poorly understood aspect of foundation models: how pre-training data shapes emergent abilities. Understanding this link has major implications for efficient training (data curation), targeted capability development, model safety/alignment (mitigating biases or harmful behaviors linked to specific data), and advancing the fundamental scientific understanding of how FMs work. The potential to provide causal evidence linking data subsets to skills like reasoning would be a substantial contribution to the field, directly aligning with the goals of the workshop."
