    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding pre-training data's impact on emergent abilities in FMs. The methodology, centered around identifying data clusters and perturbing associated representations, perfectly matches the research idea. It incorporates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review (emergent abilities, data influence, representation analysis). The objectives and significance directly echo the goals outlined in the task description, such as rigorous characterization, understanding data subsets, and potential for mitigation of undesirable behaviors."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes, Conclusion), and the research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section breaks down the process into understandable steps. However, the description of the core 'Representation Perturbation' technique, while mentioning inspiration from representation engineering and causal mediation analysis, lacks specific details on the exact methods to be employed for identifying and perturbing components. This introduces a minor ambiguity but doesn't obscure the overall research direction."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While analyzing representations and attributing model behavior to data are existing research areas, the specific approach of (1) clustering pre-training data, (2) identifying associated representation components, and (3) actively perturbing/ablating these components to causally probe their impact on *specific emergent abilities* (like reasoning on GSM8K/BIG-Bench) is innovative. It moves beyond correlational studies towards a more targeted, interventional analysis of the data-representation-capability link, offering a fresh perspective compared to standard fine-tuning or data influence studies."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established concepts (importance of pre-training data, representation learning, emergent abilities). The use of standard techniques like data clustering and benchmark evaluation is appropriate. The experimental design includes good practices like control groups and statistical analysis. However, the soundness is slightly limited by the lack of technical detail regarding the core representation perturbation methodology. Precisely identifying representation components tied to data clusters and perturbing them without causing unintended global effects is technically complex, and the proposal doesn't specify the exact techniques, assumptions, or validation methods for this crucial step. While mentioning causal mediation analysis is relevant, its application in high-dimensional latent spaces is non-trivial and requires careful justification not fully provided here."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Pre-training a large FM from scratch (as implied in section 2.2) requires substantial computational resources, which might not be available. Even using a pre-existing FM, the core technical step of reliably identifying and perturbing representation components linked to specific data clusters is highly challenging and computationally intensive. Techniques for representation engineering or causal analysis in this context are advanced and may require considerable development or adaptation. While the steps are logical, the technical difficulty and resource requirements of the perturbation phase make the overall feasibility satisfactory rather than high, carrying notable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Understanding how specific pre-training data subsets contribute to emergent abilities is a fundamental and critical challenge in FM research, directly aligned with the workshop's themes. Successfully executing this research could yield crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying FM capabilities, inform more efficient and targeted data curation strategies for training, enable better control over desired skills, and contribute to mitigating biases or undesirable behaviors stemming from the training data. The potential contributions to both scientific understanding and practical applications (like alignment and safety) are substantial."
