        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Adaptation' theme of the workshop, specifically targeting the subtopic 'Efficient methods' which asks 'Can fine-tuning be made more efficient?' and discusses modifying small parameter subspaces. Furthermore, it aims to contribute to the 'understanding of FMs' by analyzing how subspace composition relates to task complexity and how FMs balance pretraining and specialization, aligning with the workshop's core goal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (computational cost of fine-tuning), the core proposal (using Fisher information and activation patterns to identify subspaces), the methodology (specific metrics, benchmarking against LoRA/adapters, analysis plan), and the expected impact (efficiency, understanding, accessibility) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods exist (e.g., LoRA, adapters), the proposed approach for *identifying* the subspace is novel. It combines task-specific second-order information (Fisher) with pretraining-derived activation statistics in a principled way to select parameters *before* fine-tuning. This specific combination and rationale differentiate it from existing PEFT techniques that often rely on low-rank assumptions or adding new parameters."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Calculating Fisher information matrices (or approximations like empirical Fisher) is computationally intensive but standard practice in research. Analyzing activation patterns is straightforward. Implementing fine-tuning restricted to a parameter subset is technically simple. The proposed benchmarking uses standard datasets and models. While scaling Fisher computation to the largest models presents challenges, feasible approximations exist, and the core methodology is sound and implementable with current technology and knowledge."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Reducing the computational cost of fine-tuning foundation models is a critical problem, directly impacting accessibility, energy consumption, and the speed of research and deployment. Success would offer a practical, efficient fine-tuning protocol. Furthermore, the proposed analysis linking subspace properties to tasks contributes directly to the fundamental understanding of how FMs adapt and specialize, a key goal outlined in the workshop description."
