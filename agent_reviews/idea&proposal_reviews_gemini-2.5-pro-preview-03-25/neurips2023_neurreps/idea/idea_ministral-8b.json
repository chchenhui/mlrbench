    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme of symmetry and geometry in neural representations. It directly addresses the call for research incorporating symmetry/geometry into neural network design, specifically focusing on 'Theory and methods for learning invariant and equivariant representations', 'Learning and leveraging group structure in data', and applications in 'motor control'. The motivation explicitly links geometric structures observed in motor neuroscience to the application of Geometric Deep Learning (GDL), aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of bridging neuroscience and deep learning through geometric principles like equivariance and group theory (Lie groups mentioned)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly defines the problem (lack of geometric structure preservation in current motor control models) and the proposed solution (equivariant networks). The main idea and methodology are well-articulated, outlining specific steps like geometric data representation, equivariant architecture design (group convolutions, invariant pooling), and tailored training strategies. The expected outcomes and potential impact are also clearly stated, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While equivariant neural networks and their application to various domains are active research areas, the specific focus on robust motor control explicitly motivated by geometric structures observed in biological motor systems offers a fresh perspective. It combines recent advances in GDL (equivariance, group theory) with specific challenges in motor control (robustness, generalization) and insights from neuroscience. It's not proposing a fundamentally new mathematical framework but rather a novel and timely application and integration of existing, advanced concepts within the scope of the workshop."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Methodologies like group equivariant convolutions exist, and libraries supporting GDL are becoming more common. Motor control datasets (simulated or real) are available, and representing data using joint angles/velocities is standard. While designing the optimal equivariant architecture for specific motor tasks and symmetries, and potentially defining novel loss functions, will require significant research effort and experimentation, the core components rely on existing or actively developing techniques and computational resources typically available in ML research labs. No fundamental roadblocks make the idea impractical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Improving robustness and generalization in motor control is a critical challenge with direct applications in robotics, autonomous systems, prosthetics, and rehabilitation technologies. Success in this research could lead to more reliable and adaptable AI-driven motor control. Furthermore, it contributes directly to the workshop's intellectual goals by exploring the role of geometric priors (equivariance) in building effective representations, potentially offering insights applicable to both artificial and biological neural systems."
