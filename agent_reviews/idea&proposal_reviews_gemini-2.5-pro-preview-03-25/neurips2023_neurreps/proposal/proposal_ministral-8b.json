    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of symmetry and geometry in neural representations by proposing the NGP framework. The objectives (metrics, proofs, experiments) perfectly match the research idea. The methodology incorporates concepts (GDL, TDA, manifold learning) and addresses challenges identified in the literature review. It explicitly aims to bridge neuroscience and ML, analyzing both biological (grid cells, head direction) and artificial systems, fitting the workshop's interdisciplinary goals and scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly written. The objectives are distinct, the methodology follows a logical progression (lit review, metric dev, math analysis, experiments, integration), and the expected outcomes are well-defined. The language is precise, and the core concept of Neural Geometry Preservation is explained effectively. While deeper technical details on specific metrics or proof strategies could be elaborated further, the proposal provides sufficient clarity for understanding the research direction and plan at this stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality by aiming to create a *unified formal framework* (NGP) that quantifies geometric preservation across *both* biological and artificial systems. While building upon existing work in GDL, TDA, and neuroscience (as cited), the synthesis into a single framework featuring specific distortion metrics, mathematical proofs of optimal preservation strategies under constraints, and systematic cross-domain validation presents a novel research direction. It moves beyond applying existing tools to proposing a new theoretical lens for understanding neural computation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is grounded in solid theoretical foundations from differential geometry, topology, GDL, and computational neuroscience. The methodology is rigorous, involving theoretical development, mathematical analysis, and experimental validation. The reliance on established mathematical tools (Riemannian geometry, Lie groups, TDA) is appropriate. However, the ambition to derive 'mathematical proofs showing optimal preservation strategies' is high and presents theoretical challenges whose successful resolution is key to the overall soundness. The precise definition and tractability of 'optimality' and 'constraints' need further rigorous development."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal's feasibility is questionable due to its ambitious scope and inherent technical challenges. Developing novel, robust geometric distortion metrics, deriving rigorous mathematical proofs for optimality, and conducting comprehensive experiments across diverse biological (requiring potentially difficult data acquisition) and artificial systems represent significant hurdles. Integrating these principles into existing complex architectures is also non-trivial. Successfully executing all components requires substantial expertise, resources, and potentially extensive collaborations, making the overall plan somewhat risky within typical project constraints."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem concerning the fundamental principles of information processing in neural systems. Understanding geometric preservation has major implications for both neuroscience (elucidating neural coding) and machine learning (developing more robust, efficient, and generalizable models). The explicit goal of bridging these two fields enhances its potential impact. A successful NGP framework could offer transformative insights and tools, with broad applicability across AI domains."
