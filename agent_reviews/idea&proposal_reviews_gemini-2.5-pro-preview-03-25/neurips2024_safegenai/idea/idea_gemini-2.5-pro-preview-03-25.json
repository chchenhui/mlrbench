    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Safe Generative AI', specifically tackling 'Bias and fairness issues in generated content' within the context of 'scientific discoveries'. The motivation explicitly links generative model biases in science to potential negative impacts and inequitable outcomes, aligning perfectly with the workshop's concerns about bias and ethical implications in specific application domains mentioned."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated with a well-defined motivation, main objective, and a structured three-part approach (detect, mitigate, evaluate). The concepts of using causal inference on knowledge graphs, counterfactual fine-tuning/prompting, and novel evaluation metrics are presented logically. While specific technical details (e.g., exact causal methods, precise prompting strategies, definition of novel metrics) are high-level, the overall research direction and methodology are well-defined and understandable for a research proposal summary."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While debiasing generative models, using knowledge graphs, and applying causal inference are existing research areas, the proposed combination and application are innovative. Specifically, the focus on *proactive* debiasing *before* issues arise in the specific context of *scientific discovery* (hypothesis generation, experimental design), using causal inference on scientific KGs to identify bias sources, and developing *novel metrics* for scientific output diversity alongside fairness metrics, represents a fresh perspective and a novel synthesis of existing techniques for a specific, important problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Constructing or accessing comprehensive, high-quality scientific knowledge graphs is non-trivial. Applying robust causal inference techniques effectively on such complex data is challenging. Implementing counterfactually-aware fine-tuning requires substantial computational resources and expertise with large generative models. Defining and validating novel metrics for scientific diversity and novelty is complex and requires domain expertise. While challenging, these steps are within the scope of current ML research capabilities, making the project feasible with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance. Bias in AI-driven scientific discovery is a critical issue that can stifle innovation, perpetuate inequities (e.g., in health research), and lead to unreliable scientific conclusions. Addressing this proactively can significantly enhance the trustworthiness, fairness, and potentially the groundbreaking nature of AI's contribution to science. Ensuring generative models explore diverse and under-represented hypotheses could lead to major advancements, making this research highly impactful for both AI safety and scientific progress."
