        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses 'Overconfidence in the reliability of generated content', which is explicitly listed as a key topic for the Safe Generative AI Workshop. The motivation clearly links this overconfidence (termed 'hallucinatory confidence') to safety risks and negative impacts in critical domains, aligning perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on AI safety concerns related to generative models. The focus on generative models like LLMs is also central to the workshop's scope."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is very clearly articulated. It defines the core problem ('hallucinatory confidence') effectively and proposes a distinct two-phase solution (calibration framework and verification system). Key components like specialized datasets, uncertainty-aware objectives, triangulation, and human-in-the-loop feedback are mentioned, making the overall approach understandable. While specific algorithmic details are not provided (which is typical for an idea summary), the concept is well-defined and leaves little room for ambiguity regarding the main goals and methods."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While confidence calibration and uncertainty quantification are existing research areas, the specific focus on 'hallucinatory confidence' in modern large generative models, distinct from mere factual accuracy, offers a fresh perspective. The proposed combination of an uncertainty-aware training framework (using specialized 'known unknowns' datasets) and a post-hoc verification system involving triangulation across multiple sources/paths presents a novel integrated approach. Creating datasets specifically designed to elicit and measure inappropriate confidence is also an innovative aspect."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed components are largely feasible using extensions of current techniques. Uncertainty-aware training objectives exist, though applying them effectively to large models requires significant compute. Creating 'known unknowns' datasets is challenging but achievable through careful curation or adversarial methods. The verification system involving triangulation and human feedback is conceptually sound but could be computationally expensive and complex to implement robustly. Overall, it's a challenging but plausible research direction, requiring substantial resources and engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The problem of generative models producing incorrect information with high confidence is a major barrier to their safe and trustworthy deployment, especially in high-stakes applications mentioned in the motivation (healthcare, legal). Addressing this 'hallucinatory confidence' is critical for AI safety. Successfully developing methods to detect and mitigate it would be a significant contribution, potentially leading to much more reliable AI systems and increasing user trust, thus having a substantial impact on the field and its applications."
