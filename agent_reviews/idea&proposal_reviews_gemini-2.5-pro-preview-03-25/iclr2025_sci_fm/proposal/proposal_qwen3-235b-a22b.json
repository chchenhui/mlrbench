    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (workshop on open science for FMs, focusing on efficiency, open training), the research idea (federated distillation for efficient open FMs using a proxy dataset), and the literature review (building upon FL, KD, addressing heterogeneity, communication, privacy). It directly addresses the workshop's call for open training protocols and compute efficiency techniques like distillation. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core research idea, and the background/significance sections explicitly connect the work to the goals of open science and democratization mentioned in the task description and idea. It incorporates and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section outlines the FedDist framework, proxy dataset concept, local training, and distillation/aggregation steps logically. Formulas are provided for key components like losses and aggregation. The experimental design is detailed with datasets, baselines, metrics, and hyperparameters. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor areas for refinement include the placeholder diagram and potentially adding more detail on the specific DP mechanism or the exact nature of the proxy data synthesis/curation. The cross-entropy loss formulation could be slightly more precise depending on the exact output format of Tc(x)."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Federated Learning and Knowledge Distillation are established fields, and the use of public proxy data for distillation in FL has been explored (as acknowledged in the literature review and baselines like HierarchyFL), the specific application and synthesis of these techniques for *training open foundation models* collaboratively and efficiently is innovative. The focus on democratizing FM access by combining FL privacy benefits with KD efficiency via a proxy dataset, specifically targeting the FM scale and open science context, distinguishes it from prior work which might focus on general FL efficiency or specific tasks. It's a novel combination and application rather than a fundamentally new algorithm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations of Federated Learning and Knowledge Distillation. The methodology is logical, addressing key challenges like privacy (DP mention), communication (quantization, top-k), and heterogeneity (regularization). The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics. However, the technical formulation for the classification loss needs clarification, and the KL regularization term's formulation is slightly unconventional (KL between softmax output and uniform distribution, likely aiming for entropy maximization, but could be stated more standardly). The core assumption that a small proxy dataset can effectively capture knowledge from diverse clients for FM distillation is critical and requires strong empirical validation, representing a potential methodological challenge."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The methodology relies on standard ML techniques (FL, KD, optimizers, potentially GANs) and libraries. The proposed datasets are common benchmarks in FL research. Simulating the federated environment on a GPU cluster (as mentioned) is a standard and practical approach. While integrating the components (FL, KD, DP, compression) and effectively designing/tuning the proxy dataset mechanism presents engineering challenges, there are no fundamental roadblocks suggesting impracticality. The plan is realistic, and the required resources are generally accessible for ML research groups."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical and timely problem of the resource barrier and lack of openness in foundation model development. By aiming to enable collaborative, privacy-preserving, and efficient training of FMs, it directly contributes to the democratization of AI research, aligning perfectly with the goals of the SCI-FM workshop. Success would mean providing a practical framework for smaller institutions or distributed groups to develop capable FMs, potentially impacting open science practices and enabling FM applications in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive domains. The potential impact on accessibility and reproducibility is substantial."
