    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (SCI-FM workshop focus on open models, efficiency, training protocols), the research idea (federated distillation for efficient open FMs using a proxy dataset), and the literature review (building upon concepts like FD, FFMs, prototypes, heterogeneity handling, and addressing identified challenges). It directly targets the workshop's themes of open science, compute efficiency, and novel training strategies for FMs. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core research idea, and it incorporates and aims to tackle challenges highlighted in the provided literature (heterogeneity, communication, privacy)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured, clearly written, and generally easy to understand. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the framework, algorithms (including different distillation types), data handling, heterogeneity mitigation, communication optimization, and experimental design. The rationale is clearly articulated. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise calculation of confidence weights or the exact form of the domain adaptation function, and the mentioned Figure 1 was not provided, slightly hindering full visualization. However, these are minor points in an otherwise very clear proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, primarily through the specific synthesis and application of existing techniques to the problem of open foundation model training. While Federated Distillation itself is not new (as shown in the literature review), the proposed combination of response-based, feature-based, and prototype-based distillation within a federated framework specifically for FMs, coupled with tailored heterogeneity handling and communication optimizations, offers a fresh perspective. It distinguishes itself from standard FedAvg and simpler FD approaches by integrating these multiple facets. The focus on democratizing *open* FMs via this specific mechanism adds to its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and methodologically rigorous. It builds upon established foundations of federated learning and knowledge distillation. The proposed framework components are logical, and the algorithmic details, including different distillation types and loss functions, are well-described (though some specifics like hyperparameter tuning or exact function forms need empirical validation). The plan for addressing heterogeneity and optimizing communication uses relevant techniques. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate metrics, strong baselines, and necessary ablation studies, indicating a rigorous approach to validation. The approach is well-supported by the cited recent literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible within a research context, particularly using simulations. The required techniques (FL, KD, transformers) are well-understood. However, implementing the full framework presents notable challenges: integrating multiple complex distillation methods effectively, robustly handling significant data heterogeneity across many participants (scaling up to 50 is ambitious), ensuring the public proxy dataset is adequate for diverse knowledge transfer, and achieving the projected high levels of performance and communication efficiency. Real-world deployment would add further complexity regarding coordination and infrastructure. The plan is generally realistic for a research project, but significant engineering effort and empirical tuning will be required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses issues of high significance in the current AI landscape: the prohibitive cost and centralization of foundation model development, the need for open science and reproducibility, data privacy concerns, and computational/environmental efficiency. By aiming to democratize FM training and promote collaborative, privacy-preserving, resource-efficient approaches, the research has the potential for substantial scientific impact (advancing collaborative AI, open science) and practical impact (enabling broader participation, facilitating research in sensitive domains, supporting regional AI development). The alignment with the goals of accessible and transparent AI research is strong."
