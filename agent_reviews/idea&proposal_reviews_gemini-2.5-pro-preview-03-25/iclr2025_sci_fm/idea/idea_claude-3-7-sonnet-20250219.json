    "Consistency": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses 'Open Compute Efficiency Techniques' (compression, quantization for FMs), which is explicitly listed in the workshop scope. The goal of 'democratizing access' aligns well with the workshop's aim for accessibility. However, the proposal focuses heavily on the technical aspects of adaptive compression and doesn't explicitly state that the framework itself will be open-source or primarily target open FMs, which is the core theme ('Open Science') of the workshop. While efficiency contributes to accessibility, the 'openness' aspect could be more strongly emphasized for perfect alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the main idea is broken down into understandable components (sensitivity mapping, RL agent, resource-aware protocol, feedback loop). The overall goal is clear. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details of the RL agent or the deployment protocol, but this level of detail is acceptable for a research idea summary. It is generally easy to understand the proposed approach and its objectives."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While model compression, sensitivity analysis, and RL for optimization are existing concepts, their combination in this specific manner for foundation models appears novel. The core innovation lies in the dynamic, adaptive nature of the compression based on hardware context and task requirements, managed by an RL agent and refined via inference-time feedback loops. This moves beyond typical static or uniform compression strategies for FMs and offers a fresh perspective on balancing efficiency and performance."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Sensitivity mapping for large FMs can be computationally intensive. Training the RL agent to navigate the complex compression-performance trade-off space effectively requires careful design and substantial computational resources. Implementing the resource-aware deployment protocol with real-time feedback loops across diverse hardware adds considerable engineering complexity. While conceptually sound, successful implementation requires significant effort and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a critical and highly relevant problem: the resource-intensive nature of foundation models, which limits their deployment and accessibility. Developing effective adaptive compression techniques could significantly reduce computational requirements, enabling FM use on edge devices and in resource-constrained environments. This would democratize access to powerful AI capabilities and could lead to major advancements in efficient AI deployment, making the potential impact very high."
