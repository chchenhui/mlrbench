    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses one of the two main themes of the AI4Mat workshop: 'AI4Mat Unique Challenges: Managing Multimodal, Incomplete Materials Data'. The motivation and main idea focus explicitly on integrating heterogeneous, incomplete, and multimodal materials data using AI techniques (knowledge graphs, GNNs), which is precisely the challenge highlighted in the task description as a unique bottleneck in applying AI to materials science."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly states the motivation (fragmented data bottleneck) and outlines the core components of the proposed solution: a materials-specific ontology, physics-informed GNNs for incomplete data, and active learning for experimental guidance. The overall goal of creating a unifying platform to accelerate materials discovery is evident. While specific algorithmic details are not elaborated (which is acceptable for an idea summary), the concept and approach are well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While knowledge graphs, GNNs (including physics-informed variants), and active learning are existing concepts, their proposed integration into a specialized framework explicitly designed for multimodal, incomplete materials data with uncertainty representation is innovative. The combination of a materials-specific ontology, physics-informed reasoning over incomplete graph data, and active learning for guiding physical experiments within this context offers a fresh perspective compared to applying these techniques in isolation or in other domains."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing a comprehensive materials-specific ontology for diverse, multimodal data requires substantial domain expertise and effort. Integrating physics-informed GNNs with incomplete knowledge graphs and active learning mechanisms tailored for experimental guidance is technically complex. The most significant hurdle is likely the practical aspect of acquiring, cleaning, and integrating the highly heterogeneous and fragmented real-world materials data needed to populate the knowledge graph. Considerable resources and interdisciplinary collaboration would be required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized bottleneck in materials science â€“ the lack of integrated, comprehensive data, which hinders AI-driven discovery. As highlighted in the task description, managing such data is a unique challenge. A successful implementation could dramatically improve data accessibility and utility, enable more powerful predictive models, guide experiments efficiently, and ultimately accelerate the discovery and design of new materials, leading to major advancements in the field."
