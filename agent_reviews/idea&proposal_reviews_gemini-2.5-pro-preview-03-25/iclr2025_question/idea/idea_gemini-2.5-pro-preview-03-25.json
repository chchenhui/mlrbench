    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task focuses on uncertainty quantification (UQ) and hallucination mitigation in foundation models. The idea directly proposes an 'Uncertainty-Aware Decoding' (UAD) mechanism to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs by leveraging uncertainty metrics during generation. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals and directly addresses key questions like 'How can we effectively detect and mitigate hallucinations in generative models?' and implicitly touches upon 'scalable and computationally efficient methods for estimating uncertainty' by suggesting specific metrics and evaluating overhead."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (LLM hallucinations), the core concept (UAD integrated into decoding), the proposed mechanisms (monitoring uncertainty metrics like entropy, MC dropout, ensembles), the intervention strategies (constraining, re-ranking, special tokens), and the evaluation plan (factual benchmarks, hallucination rates, quality, overhead) are all clearly defined and easy to understand. There is minimal ambiguity in the proposal's core components and objectives."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using uncertainty metrics (like entropy or ensembles) and modifying decoding strategies are known concepts, the specific proposal to integrate these dynamically into the decoding loop *explicitly* for *real-time* hallucination mitigation using interventions like constrained sampling or token re-ranking based on uncertainty thresholds is a fresh approach. Many existing methods are post-hoc or rely purely on external knowledge retrieval without leveraging intrinsic model uncertainty signals in this dynamic way during generation. The combination of specific uncertainty measures, dynamic thresholds, and targeted interventions during decoding offers a notable contribution."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. The proposed uncertainty metrics (entropy, MC dropout, lightweight ensembles) are known and implementable, although they come with varying computational costs. Modifying the decoding loop is a standard practice in LLM research. Integrating interventions like constrained sampling or re-ranking is technically achievable. Standard benchmarks exist for evaluation. The main challenges lie in effectively tuning the dynamic uncertainty threshold, balancing hallucination reduction against potential impacts on generation quality/diversity, and managing the computational overhead, but these seem like engineering and research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Hallucination is a critical barrier to the reliable deployment of LLMs, especially in high-stakes domains mentioned in the task description. Developing methods to proactively mitigate hallucinations *during* generation, rather than just detecting them post-hoc, could lead to major advancements in LLM trustworthiness and factual accuracy. Success in this area would address a key problem highlighted by the workshop and the broader AI community, potentially enabling safer and more reliable use of LLMs."
