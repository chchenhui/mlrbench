        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for 'scalable and computationally efficient methods for estimating uncertainty in large language models' and methods to 'detect and mitigate hallucinations'. LatentFlow directly addresses these core requirements by proposing a lightweight (normalizing flows on frozen activations) method aimed at real-time uncertainty quantification and hallucination detection, specifically targeting the computational limitations of existing approaches like ensembles or MC-dropout. It aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on UQ and hallucinations in foundation models for reliable AI in high-stakes domains."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation, core concept (layerwise normalizing flows on activations), methodology steps (extraction, training, inference, calibration), and expected outcomes (low-overhead UQ, improved detection, insights) are articulated concisely and logically. The mechanism (low likelihood indicating OOD/hallucination) is easy to grasp. Minor details like the specific type of normalizing flow or the exact aggregation function could be further specified, but the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using internal model representations for analysis or OOD detection isn't entirely new, and normalizing flows are standard density estimators, the specific application of training *layerwise* normalizing flows on *frozen LLM activations* for the dual purpose of *uncertainty quantification and hallucination detection* appears novel. It differs significantly from common UQ methods focusing on output probabilities (entropy, softmax variance) or model parameters (MC-dropout, ensembles). The layerwise approach and the focus on activation density offer a fresh perspective on monitoring the internal state of LLMs for detecting anomalies like hallucinations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and resources. It requires access to pre-trained LLM activations (possible with open models or API access allowing hidden state retrieval) and standard machine learning libraries for implementing normalizing flows. Training small NFs per layer on a large corpus is computationally intensive but likely much less demanding than training large ensembles or fine-tuning the LLM itself. Inference requires one LLM forward pass plus passes through relatively small NFs, potentially achieving the claimed low overhead compared to alternatives. Standard hallucination benchmarks exist for calibration and evaluation. The main challenge might be optimizing the NF architecture and training for efficiency and effectiveness across diverse LLMs and tasks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Hallucinations and lack of reliable uncertainty estimates are major barriers to the trustworthy deployment of LLMs, especially in critical domains like healthcare and law, as highlighted in the task description. Developing a scalable, low-overhead method for real-time UQ and hallucination detection would be a major advancement. Success could significantly enhance LLM safety, reliability, and user trust, directly addressing a critical need in the field and potentially enabling wider adoption in high-stakes applications."
