    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core task of UQ for mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, using methods (entropy, MC dropout, ensembles, decoding interventions) explicitly mentioned in the idea and reflected in the literature review. It targets key challenges like computational efficiency and evaluation benchmarks identified in the task and literature. While it doesn't explicitly cover every aspect of the broad workshop task (e.g., multimodal systems, communication to stakeholders), its focus is highly consistent with the central theme and the specific research idea provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. Objectives are distinct, the methodology section provides good detail on the framework, metrics (with formulas), interventions, and experimental setup. The inclusion of pseudocode aids understanding. The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the specifics of lightweight ensemble creation/training, the exact mechanism for dynamic threshold updates beyond the formula provided, and the feasibility of applying all methods (like MC dropout) to all listed models (e.g., GPT-3). Figure 1 is mentioned but not included. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core concept of uncertainty-aware decoding to mitigate hallucinations is timely but not groundbreaking, as evidenced by the provided 2023 literature review which lists several papers exploring similar ideas (e.g., papers 1, 3, 4, 8, 10). The novelty lies more in the specific combination and comparative evaluation of multiple uncertainty metrics (entropy, MC dropout, lightweight ensemble) and intervention strategies (constrained sampling, re-ranking, flagging) within a unified dynamic framework (UAD). It represents a solid incremental contribution by synthesizing and evaluating recent techniques rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages well-established UQ techniques (predictive entropy, MC dropout, ensemble disagreement) and applies them logically within the decoding process. The proposed intervention strategies are relevant responses to detected uncertainty. The experimental design is comprehensive, including standard benchmarks, multiple evaluation metrics (automatic and human), ablation studies, and comparison to appropriate baselines (including a cited SOTA method, CALM). Technical formulations for metrics are correct. Minor points like the justification for the specific dynamic threshold formula or details on the lightweight ensemble could be strengthened, but the overall methodology is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard LLMs, existing benchmarks, and established UQ methods. The technical implementation, while complex, is within the capabilities of experienced ML researchers. Data sources are available. The main challenges, acknowledged partly in the limitations, include managing the computational overhead (especially for ensembles and MC dropout) to meet the <20% target, achieving the ambitious performance improvement goals (e.g., >50% error reduction), and potential limitations in applying certain techniques to all proposed models (e.g., API-based ones). However, the overall plan is realistic and implementable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of hallucinations in LLMs, which is a major barrier to their trustworthy deployment in high-stakes applications like healthcare and law, as highlighted in the task description. Developing effective mechanisms for models to quantify their uncertainty and mitigate factual errors during generation would be a major advancement. The potential impact on enabling reliable AI systems is substantial. The research directly contributes to the goals of trustworthy AI and aligns perfectly with the motivations outlined in the task description."
