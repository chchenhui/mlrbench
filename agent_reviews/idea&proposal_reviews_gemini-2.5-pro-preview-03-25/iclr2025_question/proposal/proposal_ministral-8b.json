    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for methods to mitigate hallucinations using uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The objectives and methodology precisely follow the research idea of Uncertainty-Aware Decoding (UAD), incorporating token-level uncertainty monitoring and intervention strategies. It also acknowledges and aims to address challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as computational overhead and threshold calibration, by proposing specific methods (lightweight ensembles, dynamic thresholding) and evaluation metrics (efficiency)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, significance, and overall methodology are easy to understand. The steps for UQ estimation, intervention, and evaluation are logically laid out. However, some areas could benefit from refinement. The description of dynamic thresholding using reinforcement learning is high-level; details on the state, action space, and reward function definition are missing. Similarly, the intervention strategy involving 'constraining the sampling distribution to tokens consistent with retrieved factual evidence' implies a retrieval mechanism that isn't described or included in the scope, leaving ambiguity about its implementation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The proposal has minimal originality. The core idea of using uncertainty-aware decoding to mitigate hallucinations is heavily explored in the provided literature review, with multiple 2023 papers cited covering the exact concept and similar methods (e.g., Paper 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10). The proposed UQ techniques (entropy, MC dropout, ensembles) and intervention strategies (re-ranking, special tokens) are standard or previously proposed in this context. The dynamic thresholding via RL offers a slight variation, but adaptive/dynamic thresholding is a known need (challenge 2 in lit review), and applying RL isn't inherently groundbreaking without a more detailed, innovative formulation. The proposal largely synthesizes existing ideas rather than introducing a significantly new approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established principles. The UQ methods (entropy, MC dropout, ensembles) are standard techniques. The intervention strategies like re-ranking and injecting special tokens are plausible. The evaluation plan uses appropriate metrics. However, the soundness of the dynamic thresholding via RL is hard to assess without more details on its formulation (reward signal, stability). Furthermore, the intervention strategy relying on external 'retrieved factual evidence' introduces a dependency whose soundness and integration are not addressed within the proposal itself. The technical formulations provided are correct but basic."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The UQ methods, while potentially computationally intensive (MC dropout, ensembles), are implementable with sufficient resources. Using existing datasets simplifies data collection. The main feasibility challenges lie in the potential computational overhead (acknowledged as a key challenge), the practical implementation and tuning of the RL-based dynamic thresholding, and the integration required for the evidence-constrained sampling intervention (if pursued). Overall, it's achievable within a standard ML research environment, but requires careful engineering and resource management."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: hallucination in LLMs, which is a major barrier to their reliable deployment in high-stakes applications, as highlighted in the task description. Developing effective mechanisms to mitigate hallucinations during generation, like the proposed UAD, would be a valuable contribution to making AI systems more trustworthy. Even if the novelty is limited, successfully demonstrating an efficient and effective implementation would have a clear impact on the field and practice."
