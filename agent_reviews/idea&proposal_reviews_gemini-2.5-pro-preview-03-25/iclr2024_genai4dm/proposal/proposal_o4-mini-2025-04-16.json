        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task (using generative models, specifically diffusion models, to improve sample efficiency and exploration in sparse reward RL). The methodology follows logically from the research idea, proposing a concrete mechanism (DGE) to leverage diffusion models for exploration guidance. It effectively incorporates and positions itself relative to the provided literature, citing relevant recent works on diffusion models in RL and decision-making, and acknowledging key challenges like sample efficiency and exploration which it aims to tackle."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context well, the problem statement is concise, and the research objectives are specific. The methodology section is structured logically, breaking down the approach into key components. The inclusion of Algorithm 1 (DGE) and mathematical formulations for diffusion and PPO enhances clarity. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are clearly outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for conditional trajectory generation given the current state (s_t) and the computational feasibility or exact implementation details of the diversity score D(.), but the overall proposal is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality. While using generative models for RL or exploration is an active research area (as shown in the literature review), the specific approach of pre-training a diffusion model on state trajectories and using it online to generate diverse, plausible future *goal sequences* for intrinsic reward calculation appears distinct. It differs from methods focusing on reward learning from demonstrations (Diffusion Reward), offline data augmentation (Tianci et al.), direct policy optimization via RL (DDPO), or scene generation for planning (Gen-Drive). The novelty lies in the specific mechanism of diffusion-guided goal generation for intrinsic motivation in sparse reward settings. It's a novel combination and application of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations: diffusion models for generative tasks, intrinsic motivation for exploration, and standard policy optimization algorithms (PPO). The rationale for using diffusion models (capturing plausible state manifolds from unlabeled data) is strong. The proposed methodology, including diffusion pre-training, the DGE algorithm structure, and integration with PPO, is logical and technically coherent. The evaluation plan includes appropriate baselines and metrics. Minor weaknesses include the lack of detail on the conditional generation mechanism p_theta(.|s_t) and potential challenges in efficiently and accurately computing the proposed diversity score based on diffusion model density. The binary intrinsic reward is simple and might benefit from shaping, but is a reasonable starting point."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, particularly within the proposed simulated environments (Fetch, MiniGrid). Diffusion models and PPO are standard tools. Data collection in simulation is straightforward. However, significant computational resources will be required for both pre-training the diffusion model on a large trajectory dataset (100k trajectories) and, more critically, for the online generation of K trajectory samples per environment step during RL training. Tuning the multiple hyperparameters (K, H, alpha, epsilon) will also require considerable effort. The computational cost is the main feasibility concern, potentially limiting scalability to more complex environments or longer training horizons, but it seems manageable for the proposed benchmark tasks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in RL: improving sample efficiency and exploration in sparse reward environments, which is a major bottleneck for applying RL to complex, real-world tasks. By proposing a method to leverage unlabeled trajectory data (often abundant) via powerful generative models (diffusion), it tackles this problem from a promising angle. If successful, the DGE method could lead to substantial improvements in learning speed and performance on challenging tasks, particularly in robotics and long-horizon decision-making. The potential impact on the field, by demonstrating a practical way to integrate generative priors for structured exploration, is considerable."
