        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on using generative models (specifically diffusion models) for decision making, particularly to improve sample efficiency and exploration in sparse reward settings by leveraging priors from unlabeled data (trajectories). The methodology precisely implements the research idea of using a pre-trained trajectory diffusion model for novelty-guided exploration via intrinsic rewards based on alignment with generated sequences. The proposal correctly positions itself within the recent literature cited, acknowledging related works (Diffusion Reward, DDPO, Diffusion-PPO) while clearly differentiating its specific approach focused on exploration guidance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The introduction sets the stage effectively, the objectives are explicit, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the proposed DGE framework, including technical formulations for the diffusion model adaptation, intrinsic reward calculation, and the overall algorithm. The experimental design is specific regarding environments, baselines, and metrics. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. While highly detailed, perfect clarity (10/10) might be hindered slightly for readers completely unfamiliar with diffusion models or DPPs, but the explanations provided are sufficient for experts in the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the integration of diffusion models and RL is an active research area (as shown in the literature review), the specific mechanism proposed – using a diffusion model pre-trained on state trajectories to generate plausible future sequences conditioned on the current state, and then using alignment with these sequences as an intrinsic reward signal for exploration – is a novel contribution. Combining this with DPPs for diverse trajectory sampling further enhances the novelty. It clearly distinguishes itself from cited works focusing on reward learning (Huang et al.), offline data augmentation (Tianci et al.), or directly optimizing diffusion models via RL (Black et al.)."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in RL (exploration, intrinsic motivation) and generative modeling (diffusion models). The proposed methodology, including adapting diffusion models for trajectories, conditional generation, latent space similarity for intrinsic rewards, and DPP sampling, is technically well-grounded. The technical formulations appear correct. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes relevant baselines and ablation studies. Potential challenges like computational cost and dependence on pre-training data quality are inherent to the approach but do not represent fundamental flaws in the reasoning. Minor gaps might exist in precisely defining 'related domains' for pre-training data, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but presents significant implementation challenges. Training diffusion models on trajectories and performing conditional sampling repeatedly during RL training is computationally intensive, requiring substantial GPU resources. Collecting or identifying suitable trajectory datasets for pre-training might also be a bottleneck depending on the domain. The system involves multiple complex components (encoder, diffusion model, RL agent, DPP) and hyperparameters, requiring careful engineering and tuning. While ambitious, it is achievable within a well-resourced research environment, placing it in the 'Good' feasibility range."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical and persistent challenge of exploration in sparse reward environments, a major bottleneck for applying RL to complex real-world problems. If successful, the proposed DGE framework could lead to substantial improvements in sample efficiency, making RL more practical for robotics, autonomous systems, and other domains. It directly addresses key questions posed by the workshop task description and contributes valuable insights into the synergy between generative models and decision-making, particularly regarding leveraging unlabeled data for exploration."
