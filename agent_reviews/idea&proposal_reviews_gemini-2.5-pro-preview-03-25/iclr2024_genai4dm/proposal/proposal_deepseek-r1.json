        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task (using generative models, specifically DMs, to improve sample efficiency and exploration in sparse reward RL). The methodology precisely implements the research idea (pre-trained DM guiding exploration via intrinsic rewards based on generated trajectories). It correctly positions itself within the recent literature, citing relevant work on DMs in RL while proposing a distinct approach focused on exploration guidance. All sections consistently reinforce the central theme of leveraging DMs for efficient exploration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology phases (pre-training, RL integration, evaluation), and expected outcomes are presented logically. The core mechanism of using DM-generated trajectories for intrinsic reward is explained well conceptually. However, some minor ambiguities exist, such as the lack of specification for the distance metric 'd' used for trajectory alignment, which is a key component of the intrinsic reward calculation. Further detail on how the DM is conditioned on the current state 's_t' during generation would also enhance clarity. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using generative models for intrinsic motivation or exploration isn't entirely new (e.g., RND), the specific mechanism proposed – using a pre-trained diffusion model to generate plausible future state sequences from the current state and rewarding the agent based on alignment with these sequences – appears distinct from the cited literature. It differs from works focusing on reward learning (Diffusion Reward), offline data augmentation (Gao et al.), or using RL to optimize DMs (Black et al.). The novelty lies in the specific way the DM's generative capability for *sequences* is harnessed online to provide a structured exploration signal, moving beyond simple state novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established foundations in RL (PPO, intrinsic rewards) and generative modeling (diffusion models). The core idea of using a DM pre-trained on related dynamics to provide an exploration prior is theoretically well-grounded. The proposed methodology (pre-training, integration via augmented reward, evaluation plan) is logical. The mathematical formulation for the diffusion loss is standard. The intrinsic reward formulation is conceptually sound, encouraging exploration towards DM-plausible regions. However, the lack of specification for the distance metric 'd' is a minor gap in technical detail. Potential challenges like the stability of combining DM sampling and RL updates are not explicitly discussed but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents potential implementation challenges, primarily concerning computational cost. Training video diffusion models is resource-intensive. More critically, sampling K trajectories from the DM at each episode (or potentially more frequently) within the RL loop could introduce significant computational overhead, potentially making the training process much slower than baselines. The feasibility also depends on the availability of suitable trajectory data from 'related tasks' for pre-training the DM. While technically achievable in a research setting with sufficient resources, the computational demands might hinder practical application without significant optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in RL: inefficient exploration in sparse-reward environments, which limits applications in areas like robotics. By proposing a novel method to leverage powerful generative models (DMs) to guide exploration using unlabeled data priors, it has the potential to substantially improve sample efficiency. Success would represent a significant advancement in integrating generative AI with decision-making, potentially enabling RL solutions for more complex, real-world problems where reward engineering is difficult. It directly contributes to the key themes highlighted in the task description."
