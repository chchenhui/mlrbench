        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on combining generative models (specifically diffusion models) with decision making (robotic planning, RL) to improve sample efficiency. It explicitly tackles the tentative research question: 'can diffusion models be used as physics-aware world models, thus improving the sample efficiency of online decision making methods?' The proposal fits squarely within the 'Diffusion Models and Decision Making' and 'Sample Efficiency in Decision Making' topics, targeting robotic control as an application area."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (sample efficiency in model-based RL, limitations of physics-agnostic diffusion models), the proposed method (PIDD integrating physics loss into diffusion training), the application (world model for planning/RL), and the evaluation plan (robotics tasks, sample efficiency metrics, generalization tests) are articulated concisely and logically with minimal ambiguity. The core concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using generative models as world models and incorporating physics into neural networks (like PINNs) are existing concepts, the specific integration of physics constraints directly into the training objective of a diffusion model tailored for generating realistic state-action *trajectories* for robotic planning is innovative. It offers a fresh perspective compared to standard diffusion models or traditional physics simulators used in model-based RL, representing a novel combination of existing concepts applied to a specific, challenging problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Diffusion models are well-understood, integrating loss terms is standard practice, and robotic simulation environments are available. However, defining accurate and differentiable physics-consistency losses for complex robotic interactions (e.g., contact dynamics, friction) can be challenging. Ensuring the diffusion model strictly adheres to these physics constraints during the generative process might require significant research and engineering effort. The computational cost of training such models could also be substantial. While feasible, implementation presents moderate challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Improving sample efficiency is a critical bottleneck for applying RL and planning methods to real-world robotics. Developing accurate, physics-aware world models that can generalize could lead to major advancements, enabling faster, safer, and more reliable learning in complex domains like robotic manipulation, autonomous driving, and industrial automation. Success would address a key limitation of current model-based RL approaches and could significantly broaden the applicability of these techniques."
