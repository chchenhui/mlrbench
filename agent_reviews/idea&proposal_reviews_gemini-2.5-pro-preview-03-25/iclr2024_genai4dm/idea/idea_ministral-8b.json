        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of combining generative models (specifically mentioning LLMs and diffusion models) with decision-making algorithms. It explicitly targets key workshop topics like improving sample efficiency, enhancing exploration, and facilitating transfer learning, directly referencing the potential to trade reward-labeled efficiency for unlabeled samples and use pre-trained models for complex tasks, as mentioned in the task description's tentative research questions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (sample efficiency bottleneck), the main proposal (using pre-trained generative models as priors), the expected outcomes (improved efficiency, exploration, transfer), and potential impact are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It clearly outlines the problem, proposed approach, and expected contributions."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While combining generative models and decision-making is an active research area, the specific focus on systematically investigating how pre-trained LLMs and diffusion models can be leveraged *as priors* to improve sample efficiency, exploration, and transfer learning offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond simply using models and delves into understanding the mechanisms of prior injection and its trade-offs, which constitutes a valuable and relatively novel research direction within this emerging field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Pre-trained generative models are accessible, and decision-making frameworks are well-established. However, integrating these large models effectively, defining and injecting 'priors' in a principled manner, designing appropriate benchmarks, and managing the potentially high computational costs present moderate implementation challenges. Significant expertise in both generative models and decision-making/RL would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Sample efficiency is a critical barrier to applying advanced decision-making techniques to many real-world problems. Leveraging the powerful representations learned by large generative models offers a promising avenue to overcome this limitation. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in fields like robotics, autonomous systems, and healthcare, and would provide valuable methodologies for the broader AI research community."
