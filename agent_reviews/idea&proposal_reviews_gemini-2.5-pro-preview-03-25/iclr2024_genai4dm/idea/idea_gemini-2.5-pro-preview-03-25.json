        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly asks under the 'Diffusion Models and Decision Making' topic: 'can diffusion models be used as physics-aware world models, thus improving the sample efficiency of online decision making methods?'. The research idea directly proposes developing action-conditioned diffusion models as physics-aware world models for planning and model-based RL, aiming to improve sample efficiency and decision-making in tasks requiring physical reasoning. It fits squarely within the workshop's scope and addresses a specific research question mentioned."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (need for accurate world models), the core proposal (action-conditioned diffusion models for physics-aware trajectory generation), the intended application (integration into planning/MBRL), and the evaluation domain (robotics simulation). The concept of conditioning on state-action histories to implicitly learn physics is understandable. Minor details on the specific architectural modifications for physics-awareness could be added, but the overall idea is immediately comprehensible and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses good originality. While using generative models for sequence prediction or world modeling isn't entirely new, the specific application of diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generation, as physics-aware world models for planning and MBRL is innovative. The focus on structuring the diffusion process to implicitly capture physical constraints beyond simple pixel prediction, and leveraging this for improved planning in complex physical scenarios, offers a fresh perspective compared to standard predictive models or other generative approaches used as world models. It combines existing powerful techniques (diffusion models, MBRL/planning) in a novel and relevant way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate challenges. Training diffusion models requires substantial data (observation-action sequences, available in simulation) and significant computational resources. The primary challenge lies in the integration with planning algorithms like MPC, as the iterative sampling process of diffusion models can be computationally expensive, potentially hindering real-time decision-making. However, the underlying technologies (diffusion models, MBRL frameworks, simulators) are mature. Implementation is possible for research, especially in simulation, though optimizing for speed and efficiency will be crucial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Developing accurate, physics-aware world models is a critical challenge in robotics and model-based RL, directly impacting sample efficiency and the ability to plan for complex interactions. If diffusion models can generate more physically plausible long-term trajectories than existing methods, it could lead to substantial improvements in planning performance and enable MBRL agents to tackle more complex tasks with less real-world interaction. This directly addresses the need for sample efficiency highlighted in the task description and could provide meaningful contributions to robotics and decision-making fields."
