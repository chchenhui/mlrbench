        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics outlined for the workshop, including 'Diffusion Models and Decision Making' (specifically using them as physics-aware world models), 'Sample Efficiency in Decision Making' (using generative models like video prediction for faster learning), and 'Studying how the priors in large generative models can enable sample efficiency'. The proposal focuses on leveraging diffusion models (a core generative AI technique mentioned) to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (a core decision-making problem), which is the central theme of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (RL sample inefficiency), the core proposal (diffusion-based world model pre-trained on diverse video), the mechanism (predicting future states/rewards for planning in MBRL), and the evaluation plan (robotic tasks, comparison baselines) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It clearly explains *what* is proposed, *why* it's relevant, and *how* it would be approached and evaluated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While model-based RL and using generative models as world models are established concepts, the specific proposal to use *diffusion models* pre-trained on *large-scale, diverse, unlabeled video data* to capture general physical priors for sample-efficient RL is innovative. This approach differs significantly from world models trained only on task-specific data or those using other generative architectures (like VAEs or GANs), offering a fresh perspective on leveraging large generative models for RL."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Training state-of-the-art diffusion models requires substantial computational resources (GPU clusters, large storage). Integrating the diffusion model for planning via iterative denoising within an MBRL loop might be computationally expensive, potentially impacting training time or requiring approximations. Accessing and curating large-scale diverse video datasets is also a non-trivial requirement. However, these challenges are primarily resource and engineering-related rather than fundamental roadblocks, making the idea feasible for a well-equipped research group."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Sample efficiency remains a critical bottleneck for applying RL to real-world problems, particularly in robotics and data-scarce domains. Successfully demonstrating that diffusion models pre-trained on unlabeled video can serve as effective world models to drastically reduce sample requirements would be a major advancement. It addresses a core problem in the field and could significantly accelerate the deployment of RL agents in practical settings."
