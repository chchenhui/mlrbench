        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem outlined in the task (accessibility/efficiency gap of foundation models in biology, need for iterative refinement, lab-in-the-loop). It systematically elaborates on the research idea (combining PEFT, active learning, KD, cloud interface). Furthermore, the methodology explicitly incorporates techniques (PEFT, active learning, KD, uncertainty quantification) and addresses challenges (resource constraints, adaptation, experimental feedback) highlighted in the literature review. All components of the proposal map clearly onto the requirements and context provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes), objectives are explicitly stated, and each methodological component (PEFT, Active Learning, KD, Integration) is explained in detail with relevant technical formulations (e.g., LoRA equations, KD loss). The workflow and evaluation plan are clearly outlined. While minor implementation details (e.g., specific cloud architecture choices) are omitted, this is appropriate for a proposal stage. The overall presentation is highly understandable and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While the individual components (PEFT like LoRA/Adapters, active learning strategies, knowledge distillation) are established techniques, referenced in the literature review, their specific integration into a unified 'ActiveLoop' framework explicitly designed for resource-efficient, iterative, lab-in-the-loop fine-tuning of biological foundation models is novel. The focus on combining these specific elements to bridge the gap between large models and modest lab resources represents a fresh perspective and application strategy. The novelty lies primarily in the synergistic combination and application context rather than fundamentally new algorithms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established and theoretically grounded ML techniques (PEFT, Bayesian methods for uncertainty, standard active learning acquisition functions, knowledge distillation). The technical descriptions and formulations provided (e.g., LoRA, pruning score, KD loss) appear correct. The methodology is well-justified and logically structured. Minor areas, such as the potential interaction effects of early pruning with PEFT modules or the optimal selection of uncertainty methods per task, would require empirical validation, but the overall technical approach is robust and well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core ML techniques (PEFT, AL, KD) have existing implementations and are technically achievable. The goal of resource efficiency (using PEFT) inherently supports feasibility for labs with modest hardware. However, the overall scope is ambitious, involving the development of an integrated framework and validation across three distinct biological case studies. Significant engineering effort is required for integration and the cloud interface. Real-world lab-in-the-loop integration (if involving actual wet labs) adds practical complexity. While achievable, the scope presents moderate challenges regarding resources and timeline."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses a critical bottleneck limiting the adoption of powerful foundation models in biological research: the accessibility and efficiency gap. By aiming to democratize advanced ML for labs with fewer resources and enabling efficient iterative refinement based on experimental feedback, the project has the potential to significantly accelerate biological discovery across various domains (protein engineering, drug discovery, genomics). The expected outcomes align well with pressing needs in the computational biology community."
