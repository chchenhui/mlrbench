        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop call for papers). It directly addresses multiple key topics listed, including 'Lab in the loop', 'Efficient fine-tuning and adaptation of biological foundation models', 'Accessible cloud/web-based methods', and 'uncertainty modeling'. It targets the core workshop theme of bridging the accessibility and efficiency gap for foundation models in biology for wet lab use."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation is explicitly stated, and the main idea is broken down into distinct, understandable components (parameter-efficient adapters, structured feedback, uncertainty quantification, hardware target, web interface). The proposed 'virtuous cycle' is clearly articulated. Minor details on the specific implementation of feedback encoding could be elaborated, but the overall concept is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While concepts like 'lab-in-the-loop' and 'parameter-efficient fine-tuning' (PEFT) exist, the proposed integration of these specifically for biological foundation models, focusing on accessibility for standard wet labs via consumer-grade hardware and a web interface, combined with uncertainty quantification for experiment prioritization, represents a novel application and system design. It's an innovative combination tailored to a specific, pressing need."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. PEFT methods are established and computationally efficient. Web interface development is standard. Uncertainty quantification techniques exist. Running inference and adapter tuning on consumer-grade hardware is plausible. The main challenge lies in designing a robust and generalizable 'structured feedback mechanism' to automatically encode diverse experimental outcomes into effective learning signals, which may require significant domain-specific design effort. Access to pre-trained foundation models is also assumed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck limiting the adoption of powerful foundation models in biology â€“ accessibility and iterative refinement in typical lab settings. Successfully implementing this framework could democratize advanced ML for biologists, significantly accelerate the experimental discovery cycle, and improve the real-world accuracy and utility of biological foundation models."
