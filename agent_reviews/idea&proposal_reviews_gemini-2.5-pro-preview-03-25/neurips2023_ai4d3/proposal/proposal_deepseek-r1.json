        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (AI for drug discovery, specifically structure-based design, binding prediction, molecule optimization), the research idea (E(3)-equivariant GNN with hierarchical attention for SBDD), and the literature review (building upon concepts like E(3)-equivariance, attention mechanisms, and addressing cited challenges). It comprehensively integrates the requirements and context, proposing relevant objectives, methods (using standard datasets like PDBbind, comparing against relevant baselines from the literature), and expected outcomes that directly address the core theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology, datasets, and evaluation plan are clearly defined. The core concepts of E(3)-equivariance and attention are introduced with representative equations. However, some specific implementation details could be slightly clearer, such as the precise mechanism for aggregating attention scores across hierarchical levels (residue, pocket) and the exact process for the CVAE-based molecule refinement. The mention of Kabsch alignment for preprocessing an E(3)-equivariant model could also benefit from clarification regarding its purpose."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like E(3)-equivariant GNNs and attention mechanisms exist in the literature (as reviewed), the specific combination of E(3)-equivariance with a *hierarchical* attention mechanism (atom, residue, pocket levels) applied to the *dual tasks* of binding affinity prediction and 3D-aware molecule generation/refinement within a single framework appears novel. This integration offers a fresh perspective distinct from the cited works, which typically focus on one aspect (e.g., equivariance for affinity, attention for affinity, equivariance for generation) but not this specific synergistic combination."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on solid theoretical foundations in geometric deep learning (E(3)-equivariance) and attention mechanisms. The proposed methodology (EGAN architecture, dual-task learning, standard datasets, relevant baselines, rigorous evaluation protocol) is well-justified and logical. The technical formulations provided are representative, although high-level. Minor points, such as the potential contradiction of using Kabsch alignment with an equivariant model without further explanation and the lack of full mathematical detail for the hierarchical aggregation and CVAE refinement, slightly prevent a top score, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible using existing deep learning frameworks and publicly available datasets. E(3)-equivariant networks and attention mechanisms are implementable, although complex. The main challenges lie in the successful integration of the hierarchical attention mechanism, the effective design and training of the dual-task CVAE for molecule refinement, and the significant computational resources likely required for training on large datasets like PDBbind. While achievable with appropriate expertise and resources, these factors introduce moderate implementation challenges and risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of improving accuracy and efficiency in structure-based drug design, a bottleneck in pharmaceutical R&D. By aiming to enhance binding affinity prediction and enable 3D-aware molecule generation/optimization through a novel integration of equivariance and hierarchical attention, the research has the potential to make substantial contributions. Success could lead to faster identification of drug candidates, reduced experimental costs, and potentially higher clinical success rates, aligning perfectly with the goals of applying AI in drug discovery."
