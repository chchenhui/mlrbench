    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal perfectly aligns with the task description (AI for Drug Discovery, specifically structure-based design, binding prediction, molecule optimization), the research idea (E(3)-equivariant GNN with hierarchical attention for SBDD), and the literature review (building upon cited works on equivariance and attention while addressing identified gaps). It comprehensively integrates all elements, demonstrating a clear understanding of the context and requirements."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives, background, methodology, and evaluation plans are articulated precisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist only in the exact mathematical formulation of the novel hierarchical attention mechanism, which is acceptable at the proposal stage, but the concept itself is clearly explained."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While E(3)-equivariant networks and attention mechanisms exist (as shown in the literature review), the specific combination of E(3)-equivariance with *hierarchical* attention explicitly designed to operate on *geometric* features at multiple structural levels (atom, residue/pocket) for both affinity prediction and de novo generation appears novel and well-motivated. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by proposing this specific integration."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (E(3)-equivariance, GNNs, attention) and established methods (EGNN-style updates). The proposed methodology, including data handling (PDBbind), model architecture concepts, training procedures, and evaluation plan (standard benchmarks, metrics, baselines, ablations), is robust and well-justified. Technical descriptions are clear and appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on publicly available datasets (PDBbind) and standard software tools (Open Babel, RDKit, deep learning libraries). The core techniques (equivariant GNNs, attention) have existing implementations, although the specific integration requires novel development. The main challenges are the potential computational cost and the inherent difficulty of achieving SOTA in both affinity prediction and high-quality molecule generation, but the plan is realistic for a well-resourced research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses critical challenges in structure-based drug design â€“ improving prediction accuracy and enabling effective de novo generation. Success would represent a major advancement in AI for drug discovery, potentially accelerating the identification and optimization of new drug candidates, thus having substantial scientific and practical impact. It also contributes a novel deep learning architecture."
