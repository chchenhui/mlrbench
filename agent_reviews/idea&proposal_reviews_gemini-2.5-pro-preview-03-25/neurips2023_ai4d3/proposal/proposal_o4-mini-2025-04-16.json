    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description (AI for Drug Discovery, specifically structure-based design, affinity prediction, molecule optimization), the research idea (E(3)-equivariant GNN with hierarchical attention for SBDD), and the literature review (building upon existing work on equivariance, attention, and generation, while addressing the identified gap of their integration for prediction and 3D refinement). It comprehensively addresses all requirements and demonstrates a deep understanding of the context and prior work."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and easy to follow. Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology, including data, architecture (equations for message passing, attention), training, and evaluation, is detailed and logically presented. The rationale and significance are well-articulated. Minor details, such as the specific architecture of the MLPs (\\\\\\\\phi_m, \\\\\\\\phi_h, \\\\\\\\phi_x, \\\\\\\\psi) or the pocket clustering GNN, could be further specified, but the overall proposal is immediately understandable without significant ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing the specific integration of E(3)-equivariance with hierarchical attention (both atom-level and pocket-level) within a single GNN framework. Applying this integrated model to *both* high-precision binding affinity prediction *and* direct 3D coordinate-based generative refinement addresses a gap explicitly identified in the related work section. While the components (equivariance, attention, GNNs) exist, their combination and dual application in this context represent a novel contribution distinct from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (E(3)-equivariance, GNNs, attention mechanisms) and cites relevant state-of-the-art methods. The proposed methodology (equivariant message passing, hierarchical attention, graph pooling for prediction, gradient ascent for refinement) is well-justified and technically plausible. The inclusion of chemical constraints and energy minimization in the refinement step adds rigor. The experimental design is comprehensive, including standard benchmarks, generalization tests, and ablation studies. Minor technical details could be elaborated, but the core approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing libraries (PyTorch, e3nn, OpenBabel, OpenMM) and standard datasets (PDBbind, CASF-2016, DUD-E). The required computational resources (A100 GPUs) are high but standard for this type of research. The methodology is complex, particularly the integration of hierarchical attention within an equivariant framework and the constrained generative refinement, but achievable with appropriate expertise. The plan is realistic, acknowledging potential challenges through a thorough evaluation strategy, with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses critical bottlenecks in structure-based drug discovery: accurate binding affinity prediction and efficient lead optimization. Success would lead to major advancements by potentially reducing experimental costs, improving virtual screening efficiency, providing interpretable insights via attention, and enabling direct 3D structure refinement. The potential impact on accelerating drug discovery pipelines is substantial. The work also contributes to the broader field of geometric deep learning."
