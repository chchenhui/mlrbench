        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed in the workshop call, including 'Structure-based drug design', 'Binding and affinity prediction', 'Molecule optimization', and implicitly 'Molecular representation learning'. The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of using AI to accelerate drug discovery and development by tackling the challenges of accurately modeling 3D structural data for better predictions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main technical approach (E(3)-equivariant GNNs with hierarchical attention), target application (protein-ligand interactions, affinity prediction, molecule generation), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The specific mention of E(3)-equivariance and attention mechanisms provides a clear technical direction."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While E(3)-equivariant networks and attention mechanisms are known concepts in geometric deep learning and molecular modeling, their specific combination, particularly with *hierarchical* attention tailored for protein-ligand binding sites, and the dual application to both high-precision affinity prediction and structure-based generation within a single framework offers notable originality. It builds intelligently upon recent advances rather than proposing a completely new paradigm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Libraries for E(3)-equivariant networks (e.g., e3nn) and GNNs exist. Standard datasets like PDBbind are available for training and evaluation. Implementing hierarchical attention might require custom development, but it builds on established attention principles. The main challenges are the computational resources required for training complex geometric models and potentially the complexity of integrating the prediction and generation aspects effectively, but these are typical challenges in state-of-the-art ML research and seem surmountable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Improving the accuracy of binding affinity prediction and the quality of generated molecules directly addresses major bottlenecks in structure-based drug design, a critical component of drug discovery. Success would have a substantial impact by potentially reducing the time and cost associated with identifying and optimizing lead compounds, accelerating the development of new medicines. The focus on leveraging 3D geometry accurately is key to advancing the field."
