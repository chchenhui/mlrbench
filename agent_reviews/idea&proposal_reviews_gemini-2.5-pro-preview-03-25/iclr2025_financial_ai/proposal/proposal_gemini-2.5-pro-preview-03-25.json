    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes (Generative AI, time-series, financial datasets, responsible AI, applications like risk management/fraud detection). It thoroughly elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the KDDM framework. Furthermore, it effectively synthesizes the provided literature, positioning the proposed work by acknowledging existing diffusion models for finance (Takahashi & Mizuno, Sattarov et al., etc.), the need for knowledge integration (Doe & Smith, White & Brown, Purple & Yellow), and leveraging relevant techniques like GNNs (Johnson & Lee), while explicitly aiming to tackle the key challenges identified (temporal dependencies, constraints, utility/privacy, evaluation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a strong motivation and clear objectives, followed by a detailed methodology, and concluding with expected outcomes and impact. Key concepts like KDDM, FKG, GNN Linker, conditioning mechanisms, and the loss function are explained precisely. The experimental design is comprehensive and easy to follow. While specific implementation choices might require further refinement (expected at the proposal stage), the overall research plan, rationale, and methodology are articulated with exceptional clarity and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While leveraging existing components like diffusion models, knowledge graphs, and GNNs (acknowledged through the literature review), the core novelty lies in their specific integration: using a GNN to process a financial knowledge graph (FKG) to actively guide or condition the denoising steps of a diffusion model for generating constraint-aware financial time series. This systematic framework for injecting structured domain knowledge directly into the diffusion process, particularly the proposed conditioning mechanisms and the combined loss function explicitly targeting constraint adherence alongside fidelity, represents a significant advancement over standard diffusion models or potentially simpler KG integrations mentioned in the literature (e.g., Doe & Smith, 2024). The distinction from prior work is clear."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates rigor. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations of diffusion models, KGs, and GNNs. The proposed methodology, including the KDDM architecture, KG construction approach, GNN-based conditioning, and the hybrid loss function, is well-reasoned and technically plausible. The mathematical formulations presented are appropriate. The comprehensive evaluation plan, including diverse metrics, baselines, and ablation studies, further strengthens its soundness. Potential challenges like defining differentiable constraint penalties and balancing fidelity vs. constraints are acknowledged implicitly via the proposed loss function structure, indicating a thoughtful approach. Minor uncertainties exist around the optimal integration strategy and potential optimization difficulties, but the overall approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML technologies and libraries. The plan is detailed and realistic for a research project. However, there are moderate feasibility challenges. Accessing high-quality, representative private financial data is a significant hurdle, although the proposal includes realistic mitigation strategies (public data, semi-synthetic data, potential collaborations). Constructing comprehensive and accurate Financial Knowledge Graphs requires substantial domain expertise and effort. Furthermore, training the proposed KDDM framework, involving both diffusion models and GNNs, could be computationally intensive, requiring significant resources. While achievable in a research setting, these factors introduce moderate risks and dependencies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the financial domain: the lack of high-quality, privacy-preserving, and realistic synthetic data that adheres to domain constraints. Success would have a substantial impact by democratizing data access for research, accelerating AI innovation in finance (risk, fraud, trading), enhancing compliance and risk modeling capabilities for institutions (RegTech), improving AI model robustness (especially for rare events), and promoting responsible AI practices (privacy, adherence to rules). The potential contributions – a novel generative framework, methods for FKG construction, high-utility synthetic data, and evaluation standards – are clearly articulated and promise significant advancements in both generative AI research and financial AI applications, directly aligning with the workshop's focus."
