    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description (Workshop on Financial AI focusing on Generative AI, time-series, datasets, responsible AI), the research idea (combining diffusion models and KGs for constraint-aware synthetic financial data), and the literature review (building upon recent diffusion models, KG integration, GNNs, and addressing identified challenges like constraints and fidelity). It directly tackles the workshop themes and elaborates comprehensively on the core idea, positioning itself clearly within the provided literature context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section is highly detailed, outlining data processing, KG construction, the specific diffusion model architecture (including GNN integration via FiLM layers), loss functions, sampling, and a thorough experimental plan with metrics, baselines, and ablations. Technical formulations are precise. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities might exist in the practical scope of KG construction (comprehensiveness of rules), but overall clarity is excellent."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models for financial time-series and KG integration in generative models exist separately (as shown in the literature review), the specific proposed method of integrating KG information via GNN embeddings to condition the denoiser network (using FiLM layers) within a DDPM framework for financial time-series, combined with an explicit constraint loss, represents a novel synthesis. It offers a fresh approach to enforcing domain-specific constraints, a key challenge highlighted in the literature. The novelty lies in the specific integration mechanism and its application rather than inventing entirely new components."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The proposed methodology, including the standard diffusion process, GNN embedding, FiLM conditioning, and the combined loss function (DDPM + constraint penalty), is technically well-founded and clearly justified. Technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate metrics and baselines referenced in the literature review, ensuring rigorous evaluation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard ML frameworks (PyTorch Lightning) and hardware (A100 GPUs). The required datasets include publicly available ones (S&P 500, Kaggle fraud) and simulated data, which are accessible or creatable. The core components (UNet, GNNs, DDPMs) are well-understood. Potential challenges include the effort required for comprehensive KG construction (requiring domain expertise) and the significant computational cost of training diffusion models, but these are manageable risks within a well-resourced research environment. The plan is realistic."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in financial AI: the lack of high-quality, privacy-preserving, and realistic synthetic data that adheres to domain constraints (e.g., regulations). Success would democratize research, accelerate innovation in areas like fraud detection and risk management, and promote responsible AI by enabling compliance-ready model development. The potential contribution to both the research community and the financial industry is substantial, directly aligning with the workshop's goals."
