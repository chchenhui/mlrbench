        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of Generative AI in finance, time-series modeling, financial datasets, and responsible AI by proposing a knowledge-driven diffusion model for synthetic financial time-series. The methodology clearly follows the research idea, combining diffusion models and knowledge graphs guided by GNNs. It effectively incorporates and builds upon concepts discussed in the literature review, such as diffusion models for finance (papers 1, 2, 3, 4, 9), knowledge graph integration (papers 5, 10), GNNs in finance (paper 6), and the challenges of constraints and privacy (papers 7, 8)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, objectives, and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The methodology section outlines the key components (KG, GNN, Diffusion Model), algorithmic steps, and experimental design logically. However, the mathematical formulation section (2.4) only provides standard DDPM equations and does not explicitly detail how the knowledge graph guidance via the GNN is mathematically incorporated into the diffusion model's reverse process (e.g., conditioning mechanism). This specific integration point could be more precise for perfect clarity, but overall the proposal is well-structured and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the literature review shows existing work on diffusion models for financial data (time-series and tabular) and separate work on integrating knowledge graphs/domain knowledge into generative models or using GNNs for financial tasks, the specific combination of using a GNN-informed knowledge graph to guide a diffusion model for generating *constrained financial time-series* appears novel. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself by focusing on embedding domain-specific constraints (regulatory, market dynamics) directly into the diffusion generation process via this hybrid architecture, addressing a key challenge highlighted in the literature (papers 5, 7, 8, 10)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established techniques (Diffusion Models, KGs, GNNs). The conceptual approach of using KG/GNN to guide diffusion is logical. The experimental design is well-defined with appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics covering fidelity, constraint adherence, and utility. However, the lack of mathematical specification for how the GNN output conditions or guides the diffusion model's reverse process (mentioned in Clarity) represents a minor gap in technical rigor. While the overall methodology is plausible, this core mechanism needs more formal definition to be fully assessed for soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing machine learning techniques. Diffusion models, KGs, and GNNs are actively researched areas. However, practical implementation presents moderate challenges. Constructing a comprehensive and accurate knowledge graph encoding complex financial rules and dynamics requires significant domain expertise and effort. Effectively integrating the GNN guidance into the diffusion model might require substantial experimentation and architectural design. Training these complex models, especially on large financial datasets, will be computationally intensive. Access to suitable (even anonymized) real-world financial data is also crucial. The plan is realistic for a research project but involves manageable risks and potential hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical challenges in financial AI: data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the need for compliance with domain-specific constraints (responsible AI). Generating high-fidelity, constraint-aware synthetic financial data could unlock significant advancements by enabling safer model training, facilitating research through open datasets (potentially), and improving downstream applications like fraud detection, risk modeling, and algorithmic trading. Successfully achieving the proposal's goals would represent a substantial contribution to both generative modeling and the financial AI field."
