    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses multiple key themes of the workshop (differentiable surrogates, probabilistic inverse problems, UQ, speed-up, ML for physics). The methodology is a direct elaboration of the research idea (CNO = FNO + cNF, trained via AVI). It explicitly references and aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the literature review (high-dim inverse problems, UQ, efficiency, sim-to-real). The chosen components (FNO, NFs) and the problem domain (turbulent flows) are consistent with the provided context and recent literature."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical (Intro, Objectives, Methodology, Impact). Objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the CNO architecture (FNO, cNF), the joint training process (AVI with ELBO formulation), data generation strategy, and a comprehensive evaluation plan including baselines and metrics. Mathematical notations are introduced and used appropriately. The rationale behind the approach is clearly articulated, making the proposal easy to understand with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the components (FNO, cNF, AVI) exist individually, their specific combination into a 'Conditional Neural Operator' framework trained jointly via AVI for amortized posterior inference in PDE-based inverse problems represents a novel approach. It differs from standard MCMC-on-surrogate methods by directly learning the posterior mapping and from recent diffusion-based probabilistic operators cited in the literature review by using normalizing flows. The novelty lies in the integrated architecture and the amortized inference goal for this class of problems, offering a fresh perspective compared to established techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (Bayesian inference, VI, FNOs, NFs). The proposed methodology (FNO for surrogate, cNF for posterior, AVI for training) is technically sound and appropriate for the problem. The mathematical formulation of the objective function appears correct. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and includes comparisons to relevant baselines (MCMC) and appropriate UQ metrics. Potential challenges, such as reliance on surrogate accuracy and optimization complexity, are inherent to the approach but do not represent fundamental flaws in the proposal's logic."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. Required technologies (FNO, cNF libraries, CFD solvers, GPU computing) are available. However, generating sufficient high-fidelity turbulent flow data can be computationally expensive. Jointly training the FNO and cNF via AVI can be complex and may require significant tuning. Scaling the approach effectively to high-dimensional inputs (e.g., 3D initial fields) poses a potential challenge. Success depends on access to significant computational resources and expertise in both ML and fluid dynamics. The plan is realistic but ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in scientific computing: solving high-dimensional inverse problems for complex PDE systems like turbulent flows. Providing fast, uncertainty-aware, and differentiable solutions would be a major advancement. Potential impacts include accelerating data assimilation, enabling real-time control, improving design optimization under uncertainty, and advancing ML methodology for science. The work directly aligns with critical needs identified in the workshop description and literature review (speed, UQ, differentiability for inverse problems)."
