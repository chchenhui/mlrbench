    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key themes of the workshop task, such as differentiable surrogates (FNO), probabilistic inverse problems (conditional normalizing flow for posterior estimation), uncertainty quantification, and speed-up techniques for simulation. The methodology clearly implements the core research idea of a Conditional Neural Operator (CNO). Furthermore, it effectively positions itself within the context of the provided literature review, acknowledging related work (e.g., diffusion-based models, other FNO applications) while highlighting its distinct approach (using normalizing flows for amortized variational inference) and addressing the key challenges identified (high-dim inverse problems, UQ, efficiency)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The background, research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and without ambiguity. The structure is logical, progressing from motivation to specific technical details and evaluation plans. The descriptions of the CNO architecture (FNO + conditional normalizing flow), the training objective (amortized VI via ELBO), and the experimental design (tasks, baselines, metrics) are precise and easy to understand. Minor details, like the exact transformer architecture for the conditioner, could be expanded, but the overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good originality and innovation. While FNOs and normalizing flows are existing techniques, their specific combination into a 'Conditional Neural Operator' trained end-to-end via amortized variational inference for probabilistic inverse modeling in turbulent flows represents a novel approach. The literature review highlights related work using diffusion models or focusing primarily on forward prediction; this proposal's use of conditional normalizing flows for direct, amortized posterior estimation offers a distinct perspective. The novelty lies in the specific architecture integration, the training paradigm for this joint model, and its application focus on uncertainty-aware inversion for turbulence."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (FNOs for PDE operators, normalizing flows for probabilistic modeling, variational inference). The proposed methodology, including the CNO architecture, the use of Navier-Stokes equations for data generation, and the amortized VI training objective (ELBO), is technically well-founded. The experimental design is robust, featuring relevant and challenging tasks, appropriate state-of-the-art baselines (including methods from the literature review like diffusion-based operators and IUFNO), and comprehensive evaluation metrics (Wasserstein distance, ECE, RMSE, spectral analysis, drag reduction). The technical formulations presented are correct and clearly described."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges, typical of ambitious research. Generating large-scale 2D/3D turbulent flow data requires substantial computational resources and access to reliable solvers. Implementing and training the combined CNO architecture (FNO + conditional normalizing flow with transformer conditioners) via amortized VI is complex and requires considerable ML expertise. While FNO and NF libraries exist, integrating and optimizing them for this specific task demands significant effort. The proposal assumes access to necessary computational power (GPUs). However, the steps are clearly defined, and the components rely on existing, albeit advanced, technologies, making it feasible within a well-resourced research environment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: efficient and reliable inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification for complex physical systems like turbulent flows. Success would have a substantial impact by potentially enabling real-time, uncertainty-aware analysis and control in domains like aerospace, climate modeling, and energy systems, where traditional methods are often too slow. The potential to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates and enable gradient-based optimization through a fast surrogate model represents a major advancement over existing approaches. The methodological contribution to probabilistic neural operators and scientific ML is also significant."
