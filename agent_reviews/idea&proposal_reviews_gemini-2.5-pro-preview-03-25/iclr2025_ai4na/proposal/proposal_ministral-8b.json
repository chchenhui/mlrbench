    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (AI for Nucleic Acids workshop, focusing on generative models and therapeutic design), the research idea (DiffuNA concept, methodology, validation), and the literature review (citing relevant diffusion models like RiboDiffusion, DiffSBDD, and tools like trRosettaRNA). It directly addresses the workshop's themes and builds logically upon the provided idea and context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology, and significance are well-defined. However, some technical details could be more explicit, such as how secondary structure information (from SHAPE data) is integrated into the 3D graph diffusion model, the precise nature of the reinforcement learning loop (reward function, algorithm), and the exact definition of the 'target binding pocket or structural scaffold' input during inference. The mention of a VAE loss for training diffusion models could also use clarification, as standard diffusion training often uses different objectives."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models for molecular generation and RNA inverse folding exist (as cited), DiffuNA proposes a specific combination for *de novo* RNA therapeutic design: a 3D graph diffusion model for *joint* sequence and structure generation conditioned on a target, refined via RL using stability and affinity predictors. This specific application and integration of techniques for RNA design distinguishes it from prior work like RiboDiffusion (inverse folding) and DiffSBDD (small molecules)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, based on established techniques (diffusion models, GNNs, Transformers, RL) and relevant literature. However, there are potential weaknesses. Jointly modeling sequence, secondary, and tertiary RNA structure is highly complex, and the integration of secondary structure information isn't fully detailed. The reliance on external predictors (trRosettaRNA, AutoDock) for RL refinement introduces potential inaccuracies that could mislead optimization; notably, AutoDock (1998) is quite dated for state-of-the-art docking accuracy. Data scarcity for high-quality RNA 3D structures, mentioned in the literature review, also poses a challenge to training a robust model. The mention of VAE loss needs clarification in the context of diffusion models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML expertise and frameworks. Public data sources exist, though 3D RNA structure data might be limited. Implementing the core components (diffusion model, GNN, Transformer, RL) is achievable. However, training such complex models requires significant computational resources. Integrating and effectively using external predictors poses a challenge. The primary risks involve model convergence due to task complexity/data limits, the accuracy of the RL refinement loop, and computational cost, making it feasible but challenging."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Designing functional RNA therapeutics is a critical bottleneck in drug discovery. A successful DiffuNA framework could dramatically accelerate this process, reduce costs, and enable the discovery of novel RNA-based treatments for various diseases. It addresses a key challenge highlighted in the workshop description and has the potential for substantial impact in computational biology, drug discovery, and AI for science."
