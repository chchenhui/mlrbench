    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, focusing directly on 'Generative models for NAs' and 'Nucleic Acids in Therapeutics', key topics for the AI4NA workshop. It perfectly matches the research idea provided, elaborating on the DiffuNA concept. It also demonstrates strong consistency with the literature review by acknowledging relevant prior work (RiboDiffusion, DiffSBDD, trRosettaRNA) and positioning DiffuNA as a novel contribution addressing joint sequence-structure generation, conditioning, and RL refinement, which are gaps or extensions relative to the cited papers. It explicitly aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature, such as the sequence-structure relationship."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives (joint learning, conditional generation, RL refinement) are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a good level of detail on data processing, the diffusion model architecture (forward/reverse processes, SE(3)-GNN), conditioning, RL loop, and evaluation plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise architecture details of the GNN or the lightweight docking network, but these do not significantly hinder understanding the core proposal. Overall, it is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While diffusion models and SE(3)-GNNs have been applied in related domains (e.g., small molecules - DiffSBDD, protein structure), their application to *joint* RNA sequence-structure generation, conditioned on binding pockets, and integrated with an RL refinement loop for stability/affinity appears novel. It significantly extends concepts from RiboDiffusion (inverse folding) and adapts ideas from protein/small molecule design to the specific challenges of RNA. The combination of these elements represents a fresh approach in the RNA generative modeling space."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established methods like diffusion models, SE(3)-equivariant GNNs, and reinforcement learning (PPO). The proposed joint diffusion process for continuous coordinates and discrete sequences is technically challenging but conceptually sound, with plausible formulations provided. The use of an SE(3)-GNN is appropriate for 3D structural data. The conditioning mechanism via cross-attention is standard. The RL refinement loop using predicted stability and affinity scores is a reasonable strategy, although its success depends heavily on the accuracy of the underlying predictors (trRosettaRNA, docking surrogate). The evaluation plan is comprehensive with relevant metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. Technical formulations seem correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Accessing data (PDB, RNAcentral, RMDB) is feasible, though curation requires effort. The required computational resources (8xA100 GPUs for ~3 weeks) are substantial but typical for such models. Implementing SE(3)-GNNs, joint diffusion, and RL integration requires significant expertise. A key challenge lies in the successful integration and training of the complex joint diffusion model and the RL loop, which depends on the quality of external folding predictors and the development/training of a reliable docking surrogate. The 12-month timeline is ambitious given the complexity. Overall, it's feasible for a well-equipped and expert team but carries non-trivial implementation risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Designing functional RNA therapeutics is a critical challenge with major implications for medicine. Current methods are often slow and expensive. DiffuNA aims to directly address this bottleneck by providing a potentially much faster and more explorative *de novo* design tool. If successful, it could accelerate lead discovery, enable the exploration of novel RNA motifs, and establish a new paradigm for AI-driven RNA design. The potential scientific impact (understanding sequence-structure landscapes) and practical impact (drug discovery, diagnostics) are substantial, aligning perfectly with the goals of advancing AI for nucleic acids."
