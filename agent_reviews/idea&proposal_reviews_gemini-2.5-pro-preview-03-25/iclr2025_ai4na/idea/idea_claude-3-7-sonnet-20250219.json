        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for AI applications in nucleic acids, including 'Generative models for NAs' and 'Nucleic Acids in Therapeutics: NA drug design and discovery'. The proposed 'RNA-GANDesigner' directly addresses these topics by using a generative model (GAN) for therapeutic RNA design."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly states the motivation (challenges in RNA therapeutic design), the core method (conditional GAN), key innovations (hierarchical encoding, multi-objective optimization, active learning), and the intended outcome (rapid prototyping of therapeutic RNAs). Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details of the innovations (e.g., exact encoding scheme, optimization algorithm), but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While GANs are established in generative modeling and have been explored for molecular design, their specific application to therapeutic RNA design incorporating hierarchical sequence/structure encoding, multi-objective optimization for therapeutic properties, and an active learning loop for experimental feedback represents a novel combination and approach within the RNA field. It builds upon existing techniques but applies them in a unique configuration to a challenging problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Training complex conditional GANs is computationally intensive. More critically, success depends heavily on (1) the availability of large, high-quality datasets linking RNA sequences/structures to multiple therapeutic properties (which may be scarce), (2) the accuracy of structure prediction and property prediction models used for conditioning and discrimination, and (3) the practical integration and cost/time efficiency of the experimental feedback loop for active learning. These factors make implementation non-trivial and require substantial resources and potentially advances in underlying prediction models."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Designing effective RNA therapeutics is a critical challenge in modern medicine with vast potential impact. An AI system that can efficiently design RNA molecules with desired therapeutic properties (stability, efficacy, low immunogenicity) could dramatically accelerate drug discovery and development pipelines, potentially leading to novel treatments for a wide range of diseases. It addresses a key bottleneck in a rapidly advancing field."
