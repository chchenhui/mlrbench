    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task calls for AI applications in nucleic acid research, specifically mentioning 'RNA secondary and tertiary structure prediction' and 'NA interactions' as key topics. The idea directly addresses RNA secondary structure prediction using AI (deep learning) and implicitly touches upon interactions by proposing the use of protein sequence data, which often relates to RNA function via binding. It aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of applying AI to nucleic acid challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It outlines the motivation, main steps (data collection, model architecture, training, validation), expected outcomes, and potential impact. The use of CNNs for RNA and RNNs for protein sequences with attention is specified. However, the core mechanism of *how* protein sequence data will inform RNA *secondary* structure prediction lacks specific detail. The rationale for this connection and the precise method of integrating these two distinct data types within the model could be elaborated further for perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While using deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, attention) for RNA secondary structure prediction is common, the integration of *protein sequence data* specifically for this task is less conventional. Standard methods typically rely solely on RNA sequence or comparative genomics. The novelty hinges on the hypothesis and implementation that protein sequence information can provide meaningful signals to improve secondary structure prediction, potentially reflecting in vivo contexts or protein-RNA interactions influencing structure. The specific model architecture itself is a combination of known components, but their application in this cross-modal context for this specific task offers a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, and attention mechanisms are well-established, and implementing a hybrid architecture is technically achievable. RNA sequence and structure data are available, as is protein sequence data. The main challenge lies in curating relevant and high-quality *paired* data where specific protein sequences are meaningfully linked to the secondary structure of specific RNAs. Establishing this link robustly (e.g., through known interactions, co-evolutionary signals, or other biological rationale) and obtaining sufficient data for training might require significant effort and careful design. Standard computational resources for deep learning would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant with clear impact potential. Accurate RNA secondary structure prediction is a fundamental problem in molecular biology with direct implications for understanding RNA function, regulation, and designing RNA-based therapeutics (e.g., mRNA vaccines, RNAi, CRISPR guides). Improving upon existing methods, especially by incorporating potentially relevant contextual information like protein interactions (even if proxied by sequence), could lead to meaningful advancements. Success would contribute valuable tools and insights to both the computational biology and AI for nucleic acids communities, aligning well with the workshop's aims."
