        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses key topics listed in the workshop task description, specifically 'Generative models for NAs' and 'Nucleic Acids in Therapeutics: NA drug design and discovery'. It proposes an AI method (diffusion model) for a nucleic acid challenge (RNA therapeutic design), aligning perfectly with the workshop's aim to spotlight AI applications for nucleic acids."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It outlines the motivation, core technique (3D graph diffusion), data sources, training/inference process, refinement mechanism (RL loop), and validation plan. Minor ambiguities exist regarding specific architectural details or the exact implementation of the RL surrogates, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models and GNNs exist, applying a 3D graph-based diffusion model to jointly generate RNA sequence and structure, conditioned on functional requirements (binding pockets/scaffolds) and refined via RL for stability/affinity, represents a novel combination and application within the RNA design space. It moves beyond simpler generative approaches for nucleic acids."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents challenges. It requires significant expertise in complex areas (diffusion models, GNNs, RNA structure, RL) and substantial computational resources. Access to public data (PDB, SHAPE) is feasible. Key challenges include the computational cost of training 3D graph diffusion models and the reliability/accuracy of the folding predictors and docking surrogates needed for the RL refinement loop. Implementation requires careful engineering but leverages existing methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Accelerating the design of functional RNA therapeutics addresses a critical bottleneck in drug discovery. Success could lead to faster development of new treatments and expand the scope of RNA-based medicine. It tackles an important problem with high potential impact on both computational biology and therapeutic development."
