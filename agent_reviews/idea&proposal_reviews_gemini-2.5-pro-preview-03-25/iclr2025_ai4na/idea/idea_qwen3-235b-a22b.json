        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (AI4NA workshop). It directly addresses multiple core topics listed: 'Foundation and Generative Models for Nucleic Acids' (proposing a multimodal RNA foundation model and generative design), 'Nucleic Acids in Therapeutics' (focusing on RNA drug design and discovery), and implicitly touches upon 'Nucleic Acid Structure and Function' by incorporating structural data. The goal of accelerating RNA design using AI fits perfectly with the workshop's aim to spotlight AI applications for nucleic acids and introduce challenges to the AI community."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (multimodal FM, active learning, RL integration, iterative loop), and expected outcomes are well-defined. The synergy between the components is explained. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architectures, the exact mechanism for integrating experimental feedback into the RL module, and the scale of data required, but the overall research direction is understandable and precise enough for evaluation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While multimodal foundation models and active learning exist independently, their proposed integration for iterative, experiment-guided RNA design is innovative. Specifically, using a multimodal FM (sequence, structure, function) combined with an RL-guided active learning loop that incorporates experimental feedback (in silico/vitro) to dynamically refine RNA designs represents a fresh and sophisticated approach in the field of AI-driven nucleic acid engineering. It moves beyond static prediction/generation towards adaptive design."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training a large multimodal foundation model requires substantial, diverse datasets (sequences, structures, functional assays), which might be difficult to acquire. Integrating geometric and transformer architectures is computationally intensive. The core challenge lies in effectively implementing the active learning loop, especially if relying on wet-lab experimental feedback, which can be slow and costly, potentially hindering the iterative refinement process. Using in silico validation is more feasible but might limit real-world applicability. The RL component also adds complexity. Considerable resources and expertise would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Efficiently designing RNA molecules with specific properties is a critical bottleneck in RNA therapeutics and synthetic biology. Addressing this challenge by potentially reducing experimental costs (claimed 2-3x reduction) and improving the quality of designed RNAs would represent a major advancement. Success could significantly accelerate the development of new RNA-based drugs and tools, demonstrating the power of adaptive AI in bridging computational design and experimental reality."
