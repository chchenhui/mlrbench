    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme ('To what extent can machine learning models comprehend mathematics?') and key topics (Measuring mathematical reasoning, New capabilities, Humans vs. machines, Applications). The proposal meticulously elaborates on the research idea of using adaptive PCG to overcome static benchmark limitations (contamination, generalization issues highlighted by Brown & Green, 2024; Adams & Clark, 2024; Kurtic et al., 2024) and provide fine-grained diagnostics (inspired by Xia et al., 2024). It effectively integrates concepts from the literature review, such as dynamic generation (Kurtic et al., 2024; Johnson & Williams, 2024), adaptive difficulty/training (Xu et al., 2025; White & Black, 2025), and reasoning evaluation (Xia et al., 2024), into a cohesive plan that directly tackles the identified challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and logically follow from the background. The methodology section provides a clear breakdown of the proposed ADAPT-MATH system into distinct modules (Problem Specification, PCG Engine, LLM Interaction & Analysis, Adaptation Controller) with detailed descriptions of their functions. The concepts of problem templates, adaptation mechanisms (including a concrete heuristic example), experimental design, and evaluation metrics are articulated precisely and without significant ambiguity. The structure is logical, making it easy to follow the proposed research plan from motivation to expected impact."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several existing concepts (PCG, adaptive testing, reasoning process analysis) into a novel framework (ADAPT-MATH) specifically tailored for evaluating LLM mathematical reasoning. While individual components like PCG for math (Doe & Smith, 2023; Johnson & Williams, 2024) and dynamic/adaptive systems (Kurtic et al., 2024; White & Black, 2025) exist, the integration into a comprehensive, adaptive evaluation system focused on fine-grained diagnostics and contamination resistance for LLMs is a fresh approach. It moves beyond existing dynamic benchmarks (like Mathador-LM) by incorporating performance-based adaptation and explicit reasoning step analysis. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and application rather than fundamentally new techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in procedural content generation, adaptive testing principles (mentioning IRT/Bayesian approaches), and LLM evaluation methodologies (citing ReasonEval for process analysis). The proposed methodology, including the modular system architecture and the multi-stage validation plan (PCG validation, adaptation simulation, LLM assessment study), is robust and well-justified. The use of symbolic solvers (SymPy) for ground truth generation adds to the technical soundness. It correctly identifies and references key challenges from the literature (contamination, reasoning steps, generalization). While the implementation details of the adaptation function and reasoning taxonomy require further development, the overall approach is technically well-grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing a comprehensive PCG engine covering diverse mathematical domains, skills, and difficulty levels, along with robust ground-truth generation (including reasoning steps), is a substantial undertaking. Implementing and fine-tuning the adaptive mechanism effectively requires careful design and experimentation. Integrating reliable reasoning process analysis based on methods like ReasonEval adds complexity. The project requires considerable computational resources for LLM evaluations and significant development effort. However, the plan leverages existing concepts and tools, and the modular design allows for incremental development. With adequate resources and expertise, the project is achievable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in AI: the limitations of current methods for evaluating the mathematical reasoning capabilities of increasingly powerful LLMs. By proposing a dynamic, adaptive, and contamination-resistant benchmark that provides fine-grained diagnostics, it directly tackles issues of benchmark validity and the need for deeper understanding beyond simple accuracy scores. The research aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals and has the potential to provide the community with a much-needed tool, guide future LLM development towards better reasoning, improve AI trustworthiness in STEM applications, and potentially inform AI applications in education. The expected outcomes could lead to major advancements in how AI reasoning is measured and understood."
