    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core question about measuring mathematical reasoning in LLMs, tackling the limitations of static benchmarks mentioned in the idea. It incorporates key concepts from the literature review, such as dynamic generation (Mathador-LM), evaluating reasoning quality (ReasonEval), adaptive difficulty (TATA, White & Black), PCG (Doe & Smith, etc.), and contamination resistance (Brown & Green). The proposed AMRAS system directly operationalizes the research idea, aiming to provide robust, contamination-resistant evaluation and diagnostic profiles, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, system architecture (with diagram), components (Repository, Generator, Evaluator, Adaptation Engine), experimental design, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The inclusion of an example template and formulas aids clarity. However, some technical details could be slightly more defined, such as the precise methods for empirical determination of weighting coefficients in formulas, the exact mechanism for symbolic verification of reasoning steps (v(s_i)), and the specific operational definitions for concepts like reasoning 'redundancy' and 'efficiency'. Despite these minor points needing further elaboration during implementation, the overall proposal is very well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components draw inspiration from recent work highlighted in the literature review (e.g., dynamic benchmarks, reasoning evaluation, PCG for math, adaptive difficulty), the proposed AMRAS represents a novel synthesis. The integration of adaptive PCG specifically for contamination resistance, combined with multi-faceted evaluation (accuracy, reasoning quality, strategy, generalization) driven by an adaptation engine that modifies problem generation based on performance, offers a fresh and comprehensive approach. The goal of generating detailed diagnostic profiles through this dynamic system distinguishes it from existing static benchmarks or simpler dynamic systems. It's not entirely groundbreaking in every single element, but the specific architecture and integrated functionality are innovative."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on relevant literature and established concepts (PCG, adaptive testing). The architecture is logical, and the experimental design is well-structured. The mathematical formulations for complexity and reasoning scores are plausible starting points. However, some aspects require further justification or pose technical challenges that impact full soundness at this stage. Specifically, the definitions and reliable measurement of reasoning quality components (S_{validity}, S_{redundancy}, S_{efficiency}) using automated methods (especially symbolic verification of potentially unstructured LLM outputs) are non-trivial and not fully detailed. The empirical calibration of complexity metrics and adaptation parameters is crucial and needs robust methodology. While generally sound, the proposal's success hinges on overcoming these significant technical hurdles."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current expertise in LLMs, PCG, and mathematics, but presents significant implementation challenges. Building a comprehensive and well-calibrated Problem Template Repository is labor-intensive. The most challenging aspect is the development of a robust Evaluation Module capable of accurately assessing reasoning quality (validity, redundancy, efficiency) from diverse LLM outputs; symbolic verification, in particular, can be brittle. Implementing and calibrating the complexity estimation and adaptation engine also requires considerable effort and experimentation. While the phased plan is realistic, the technical risks associated with the Evaluation Module are substantial and could impact the project timeline or necessitate simplification of goals. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable with a skilled team, though not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical, widely recognized problems in evaluating advanced AI systems: the limitations of static benchmarks due to data contamination and the need to assess deeper reasoning capabilities beyond surface-level accuracy. Developing a robust, adaptive, and contamination-resistant evaluation framework like AMRAS would be a major contribution to AI research, particularly in understanding and improving LLM reasoning. The potential impacts on benchmark development, AI safety/trustworthiness, and potentially education technology are substantial and clearly articulated. The research directly tackles core questions about machine comprehension of mathematics, aligning perfectly with the motivating themes of the field."
