    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'measuring mathematical reasoning' in LLMs, tackling the limitations of static benchmarks highlighted in the task and idea. The proposal explicitly builds upon the core concept of adaptive assessment via procedural generation outlined in the research idea. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and references recent, relevant papers from the literature review (e.g., Mathador-LM, TATA, ReasonEval, papers on PCG and contamination resistance), positioning the work appropriately within the current research landscape. It synthesizes these related works into a coherent framework, fulfilling the requirements comprehensively."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the system components (Template Library, Problem Generator, Adaptive Selector, Reasoning-Quality Evaluator) and the adaptive algorithm (Algorithm 1) using precise language and appropriate mathematical notation (IRM, Information Gain). The experimental design is thorough, specifying baselines, models, metrics, protocol, and ablation studies. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like PCG for math problems, adaptive testing using IRT, and evaluating reasoning steps exist in prior work (as acknowledged and cited), the key novelty lies in the proposed *integration* of these elements into a single, end-to-end adaptive assessment framework specifically for LLM mathematical reasoning. Combining dynamic PCG for contamination resistance, IRT-based adaptive difficulty selection for efficient evaluation, and fine-grained reasoning quality metrics within the adaptive loop represents a significant step beyond existing static or simpler dynamic benchmarks. The synthesis itself is innovative and addresses limitations not fully covered by prior individual works."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in well-established theoretical foundations, particularly Item Response Theory (IRT) for adaptive selection and Procedural Content Generation (PCG). The use of maximizing Information Gain (IG) is a standard, robust approach in adaptive testing. The methodology is well-reasoned, and the experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical analyses. Minor areas requiring further justification or careful implementation include the practical approximation of IG, the precise operationalization and validation of the composite reasoning quality score (Q_reasoning), and ensuring the mathematical validity and accurate difficulty calibration (\\delta_i) across diverse generated problems. However, the overall technical approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The required technologies (Python, ML libraries, LLM APIs) are standard. The plan is well-defined. However, creating a comprehensive and diverse template library, ensuring accurate difficulty estimation (\\delta_i) for generated problems, implementing the adaptive selection algorithm efficiently (especially the IG estimation), and developing a robust automated reasoning-quality evaluator are non-trivial tasks requiring significant expertise and effort. Human spot-checks for evaluation mitigate some risk but don't fully automate the process. Assuming access to necessary LLM APIs and computational resources, the project is achievable but requires careful engineering and validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations of current LLM evaluation methods for mathematical reasoning, namely benchmark contamination and the lack of diagnostic depth in static tests. By proposing a contamination-resistant, adaptive, and diagnostically rich framework, the research has the potential to substantially advance how AI reasoning capabilities are measured and understood. Successful execution could lead to more reliable model comparisons, guide future model development towards genuine reasoning, and potentially impact related fields like AI safety and adaptive educational technology, as outlined in the proposal."
