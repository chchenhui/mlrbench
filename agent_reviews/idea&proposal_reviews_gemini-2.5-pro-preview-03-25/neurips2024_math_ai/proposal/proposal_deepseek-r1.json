    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core theme of measuring mathematical comprehension in LLMs and designing better benchmarks. It fully elaborates on the research idea of using adaptive PCG to overcome static benchmark limitations like contamination and lack of process evaluation. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the provided literature, citing relevant papers (ReasonEval, Mathador-LM) and tackling the key challenges identified (contamination, adaptive generation, reasoning process evaluation, generalization)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Outcomes, Conclusion), and the objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides concrete examples (algebraic template) and outlines the adaptive algorithm and evaluation metrics clearly. The language is precise and academic. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact implementation details of the Bayesian estimator for difficulty adjustment or the specific mechanisms for 'template variation', but these do not significantly impede overall understanding."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing existing concepts in a novel way. While PCG, adaptive difficulty, dynamic benchmarks (Mathador-LM), and reasoning step evaluation (ReasonEval) exist individually (as shown in the literature review), the proposal combines them into a specific framework focused on adaptive PCG (adjusting both difficulty and problem structure/style) driven by LLM performance for fine-grained *diagnostic* assessment of specific mathematical skills. This integrated approach, aimed at contamination resistance and deep reasoning analysis, offers a fresh perspective compared to static benchmarks or potentially less diagnostic dynamic ones."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the limitations of current evaluation methods and leverages established techniques from PCG and adaptive testing. The methodology is logical, incorporating constraint-based generation, performance-based adaptation, and relevant metrics including reasoning quality (via ReasonEval). The experimental design is appropriate, including comparisons with baselines and ablation studies. The technical formulation for difficulty adjustment is plausible, although practical implementation would require careful parameter tuning. The reliance on ReasonEval adds methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. Designing comprehensive, skill-specific problem templates and robust constraints requires significant domain expertise and effort. Implementing and tuning the adaptive algorithm (Bayesian estimator, template variation logic) effectively could be complex. Access to various LLM APIs and sufficient computational resources for extensive testing are necessary but standard for current research. While ambitious, the project is achievable with the right expertise and resources, though the complexity warrants a score reflecting moderate implementation hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the reliable evaluation of mathematical reasoning in LLMs, particularly given concerns about benchmark contamination and the need to assess deeper understanding versus pattern matching. Developing a dynamic, contamination-resistant, and diagnostic benchmark could have a major impact on the field, enabling more accurate model assessment, guiding targeted improvements in LLM development, and potentially informing applications in education and AI safety. The potential contributions are substantial and clearly articulated."
