        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the central theme of ML models comprehending mathematics by proposing a multi-modal approach involving LLMs. It explicitly touches upon several key workshop topics, including developing 'New capabilities' (multi-modal learning beyond just LLMs), 'Education' (developing tools for resource-limited contexts), 'Applications' (software verification, science, education), and 'Measuring mathematical reasoning' (developing benchmarks). It also implicitly relates to 'Humans vs. machines' by aiming to enhance AI reasoning towards human levels and foster collaboration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with distinct sections for motivation, main idea, methodology, outcomes, and impact. The core concept of using a multi-modal approach (LLM, CNN, symbolic reasoning) is well-articulated. The methodology outlines logical steps (data collection, preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation). While the overall vision is clear, minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise mechanisms for integrating the different modalities (text, image, symbolic) and the specific nature of the symbolic reasoning module integration, but overall it is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using LLMs or symbolic methods for mathematical reasoning isn't entirely new, the proposed integration of text, images (via CNNs), and symbolic reasoning within a single framework specifically for mathematical tasks offers a fresh perspective. Combining visual understanding (e.g., geometric diagrams, plots) with textual and symbolic processing for mathematical reasoning is less explored than text-only or text+symbolic approaches, representing a notable innovation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Gathering and annotating a large-scale, diverse multi-modal dataset (including images and corresponding symbolic proof steps) is a major undertaking. Designing and training a complex model that effectively integrates LLMs, CNNs, and symbolic reasoners presents substantial technical hurdles, particularly ensuring seamless interaction between neural and symbolic components. Significant computational resources would be required. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation requires considerable effort and potentially novel techniques for integration and training."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Improving mathematical reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI, and success could lead to major advancements. Addressing reasoning across multiple modalities reflects a more holistic approach to mathematical understanding, relevant to how humans often work (e.g., using diagrams). The potential applications mentioned (software verification, scientific discovery, education) are highly impactful. Enhancing educational tools, especially for underserved regions, adds societal value. The project addresses an important problem with the potential for meaningful contributions to AI."
