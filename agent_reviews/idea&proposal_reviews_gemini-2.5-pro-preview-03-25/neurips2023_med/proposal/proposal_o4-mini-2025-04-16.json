    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the key challenges outlined in the task description (data scarcity, robustness, interpretability, generalizability) relevant to the 'Medical Imaging meets NeurIPS' workshop. It faithfully expands upon the core concepts presented in the research idea, providing detailed methodological steps. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself within the context of the provided literature review, identifying specific gaps (the unified integration of SSL, BNNs, uncertainty-aligned attention, and adversarial robustness) that it aims to fill, referencing the summarized papers appropriately."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to literature, methodology, and expected impact. The research objectives are explicitly stated and numbered. The methodology is broken down into comprehensible stages with sufficient detail, including mathematical formulations for key concepts like the contrastive loss and ELBO. Baselines and evaluation metrics are clearly specified. While minor details like the exact architecture of the attention module could be elaborated further, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating multiple advanced techniques (self-supervised learning, Bayesian neural networks, attention mechanisms, adversarial training) into a single, coherent framework specifically tailored for robust and interpretable clinical ML. While the individual components exist in the literature (as acknowledged), their synergistic combination and application to multitask medical imaging problems are novel. The specific proposal to align attention maps with BNN uncertainty via a dedicated loss term (\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{att\\\\_align}}) represents a distinct methodological innovation. The novelty lies primarily in the sophisticated integration and the specific mechanism for uncertainty-aware explainability, rather than entirely new algorithmic building blocks."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, variational inference for BNNs, PGD for adversarial attacks). The methodology is well-reasoned, linking each component (SSL for data efficiency, BNNs for uncertainty/robustness, attention for interpretability, adversarial training for robustness) to the stated objectives. The inclusion of specific formulas, relevant baselines, and comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUC, Dice, ECE, robust accuracy, interpretability correlation, user study) demonstrates rigor. Potential challenges in optimizing the complex multi-term loss function exist, and the effectiveness of the attention-uncertainty alignment requires empirical validation, but the overall approach is methodologically robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages standard deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, Pyro) and computational resources (A100 GPUs). The use of public datasets (BraTS, ChestX-ray14) ensures a baseline for experimentation, mitigating risks associated with acquiring partner hospital data (which, if successful, would enhance the work). The proposed methods, while complex to integrate, are based on existing techniques. The scope is ambitious (multitask, multi-modal, complex framework, user study), requiring significant engineering effort and expertise. However, given appropriate resources and personnel, the project plan appears realistic with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses highly significant and pressing challenges in the clinical application of machine learning: robustness, interpretability, data efficiency, and generalizability. These are critical barriers to the trustworthy deployment of AI in healthcare. Successfully developing the proposed framework would represent a substantial contribution, potentially leading to more reliable diagnostic tools, improved clinician trust, and better patient outcomes through uncertainty-aware decision support. The focus on bridging the gap between research and clinical applicability, along with the potential for broad impact across different medical imaging tasks and modalities, underscores its high significance."
