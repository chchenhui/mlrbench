    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on ML challenges in medical imaging (robustness, reliability, data scarcity, interpretability) and the need for real-world applicability. The methodology closely follows the research idea, proposing the hybrid SSL-BNN framework, uncertainty quantification, and specific interpretability mechanisms outlined. It effectively builds upon the cited literature (SSL+MC Dropout, Bayesian methods, robustness/interpretability link) and tackles the key challenges identified (data scarcity, robustness, interpretability, uncertainty)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides a good level of detail on the datasets, algorithmic components (SSL, Bayesian fine-tuning, interpretability), and evaluation plan. The structure is logical, flowing from background to methods to expected outcomes. Equations for key concepts are included. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of 'anatomically valid transformations' or the exact implementation details of the uncertainty-aware Grad-CAM, but overall, the proposal is well-articulated and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like SSL (SimCLR variants) and BNNs (MC-dropout) have been combined before in medical imaging (as noted in the literature review, Ali et al., 2021), the specific contribution lies in the integrated framework addressing robustness, uncertainty, and interpretability simultaneously. The proposed uncertainty-aware attention mechanism (Grad-CAM guided by predictive entropy gradients) is a specific, potentially novel extension. Applying this unified framework across different modalities (MRI, X-ray) and tasks (segmentation, classification) with a focus on anatomically-aware augmentations and comprehensive robustness/interpretability evaluation adds to its novelty. It's a thoughtful synthesis and extension rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established techniques: contrastive SSL (SimCLR), Bayesian approximation via MC-dropout, and attention mechanisms (Grad-CAM). The proposed methodology, including the loss function and evaluation metrics (DSC, AUC, ECE, ASR, pointing game), is appropriate for the stated objectives. The technical formulations presented are standard. Using MC-dropout is a practical, though approximate, approach to Bayesian inference. The novel aspect, using predictive entropy gradients for Grad-CAM, is theoretically plausible but requires empirical validation, which is part of the proposed research. The overall research design is logical and well-justified based on the literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on publicly available datasets (BraTS, CheXpert) and standard deep learning techniques implementable with common libraries. The required computational resources are significant but typical for this type of research. Potential challenges include: 1) The MS-SEG 2025 dataset might not be available depending on the project timeline (though alternatives exist). 2) Securing clinician time for validating interpretability maps ('pointing game', surveys) can be difficult. 3) Achieving the specific quantitative improvements (e.g., 15% AUC gain) is ambitious and not guaranteed. However, the core technical implementation is practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical barriers to the clinical adoption of ML in medical imaging: lack of robustness, poor interpretability, data inefficiency, and inadequate uncertainty handling. By proposing an integrated solution, it tackles a core problem highlighted by the workshop organizers. Success would represent a substantial contribution towards trustworthy AI in healthcare, potentially improving diagnostic reliability, fostering clinician trust, and making advanced ML more accessible in resource-constrained settings. The focus on bridging SSL's efficiency with BNN's reliability directly addresses unmet needs in the field."
