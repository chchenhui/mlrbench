    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The workshop aims to bring together medical imaging and machine learning, focusing on challenges like complexity, robustness, accuracy, and reliability in clinical applications. The idea directly addresses these challenges by proposing hybrid deep learning models (CNNs + Transformers) to improve accuracy and robustness in medical image segmentation, a core task in the field. It aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of showcasing ML research for medical imaging and discussing solutions for unmet needs."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated. It outlines the motivation (limitations of current methods), the core concept (hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture leveraging local and global features), the basic methodology (multi-stage design, training, evaluation), and expected outcomes (improved performance, robustness). While specific architectural details are not provided, the overall research direction and goals are well-defined and understandable for the intended audience."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Combining CNNs and Transformers for various vision tasks, including medical image segmentation (e.g., TransUNet, Swin UNETR), is an active area of research and not entirely novel in itself. The core concept of using CNNs for local features and Transformers for global context is relatively established. The novelty might lie in the specific proposed 'multi-stage architecture' or unique fusion mechanisms, which are not detailed. Therefore, while relevant, it builds upon existing trends rather than introducing a fundamentally new approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Implementing hybrid CNN-Transformer models is achievable using standard deep learning frameworks and hardware (GPUs). The main components (CNNs, Transformers) are well-understood. Potential challenges include the need for large-scale annotated medical datasets (which can be difficult to obtain and curate), significant computational resources for training complex models, and rigorous evaluation on diverse clinical datasets to truly assess robustness, which might face practical hurdles regarding data access and variability."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Medical image segmentation is a fundamental task with direct clinical relevance for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. Improving accuracy and especially robustness against data variability (a key challenge highlighted in the task description) could lead to more reliable clinical tools, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing clinician workload, and ultimately benefiting patient outcomes. Addressing the robustness issue is particularly important for translating ML models into real-world clinical practice."
