        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task emphasizes the need for 'robust, accurate, and reliable solutions' in medical imaging due to 'domain complexity and constraints'. The idea directly addresses this by focusing on robust uncertainty quantification under domain shift, a key challenge hindering reliable clinical deployment. It tackles the 'unmet needs in machine learning for successful applications in medical imaging' by proposing a method to improve model trustworthiness when faced with data variations common in clinical settings."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, core concept (combining post-hoc calibration and test-time adaptation), and expected outcomes are clearly stated. It identifies specific techniques (temperature scaling, UDA) and the goal (dynamic adjustment based on detected shifts). Minor ambiguity exists in the precise mechanism of 'dynamically adjusting uncertainty calibration based on detected shifts', but for an abstract-level idea, it is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While post-hoc calibration, uncertainty quantification, and domain adaptation are existing fields, the proposed combination, specifically the dynamic adjustment of calibration parameters at test-time based on detected domain shifts using adaptation techniques, offers a fresh perspective. It's not just applying UQ and DA sequentially but suggests an integrated, adaptive framework tailored for robust calibration under shift, which is a notable contribution beyond standard practices."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Post-hoc calibration methods are generally lightweight. Test-time domain adaptation techniques and methods for detecting domain shifts exist and are actively researched. Combining these components is technically achievable with current ML knowledge and tools. Access to multi-domain medical imaging data would be required for evaluation, which is standard for this type of research. Potential challenges might involve the computational cost of test-time adaptation and ensuring the adaptation process itself is robust, but these are research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Poorly calibrated predictions and overconfidence under domain shift are major barriers to the safe and reliable use of AI in clinical practice. Improving uncertainty calibration, especially on out-of-distribution data encountered during deployment, directly addresses a critical need for trustworthy medical AI. Success in this research could lead to safer clinical decision support systems and increase clinician trust, representing a major advancement for the field."
