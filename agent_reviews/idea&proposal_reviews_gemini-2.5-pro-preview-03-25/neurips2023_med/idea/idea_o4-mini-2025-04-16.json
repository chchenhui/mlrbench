        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses key challenges highlighted in the workshop call, such as data scarcity (especially for rare conditions), privacy constraints (data silos), domain complexity (generalization across scanners/populations), and the need for robust ML solutions in medical imaging. It proposes a specific ML approach (Federated Self-Supervised Learning) tailored to these medical imaging constraints, fitting perfectly with the workshop's aim to discuss challenges and opportunities for ML in this field."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (siloed data, privacy, limited labels, generalization). The proposed method (FedSSL, contrastive pretraining, federated averaging, domain adaptation techniques like domain-specific BN and prototypical alignment, fine-tuning) is described logically. The goal (improved rare disease detection) is explicit. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact implementation details (e.g., specific contrastive loss variants, precise mechanism of prototypical alignment), but the overall concept is well-articulated and understandable for the target audience."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While Federated Learning (FL), Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), and domain adaptation are existing concepts, their specific combination and application here are innovative. Applying FedSSL to pretrain robust representations specifically for *rare disease* detection across multiple institutions, and integrating *both* domain-specific batch normalization *and* a global prototypical alignment loss to mitigate domain shifts within this FedSSL framework for medical images, offers a fresh perspective. It's not a fundamentally new algorithm but a novel synthesis and application tailored to a challenging problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and ML knowledge. FL frameworks, SSL techniques (contrastive learning), and domain adaptation methods are available. The main challenge lies in the practical implementation across multiple institutions, requiring data access agreements, secure infrastructure, and coordination, which are significant but inherent hurdles for any federated medical project. The technical components (model training, aggregation, loss implementation) are achievable, though complex. The reliance on only a *small* labeled set for fine-tuning enhances feasibility compared to fully supervised approaches."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of detecting rare diseases, where data scarcity and heterogeneity are major obstacles. By enabling privacy-preserving learning from decentralized, unlabeled data, it could lead to more robust and generalizable models, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling earlier detection. Success would represent a major advancement in collaborative medical AI, demonstrating how to overcome data access limitations for high-impact clinical applications, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of addressing unmet needs."
