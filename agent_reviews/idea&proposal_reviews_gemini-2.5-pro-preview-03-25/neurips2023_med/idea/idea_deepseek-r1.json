        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: the need for robust, accurate, and reliable ML solutions in medical imaging, tackling data complexity and heterogeneity (via multi-institutional FL), improving diagnostic reliability (via uncertainty quantification), and proposing novel ML approaches (FL + AL + BNNs) to overcome current limitations. It fits perfectly within the scope of discussing challenges and opportunities at the intersection of ML and medical imaging."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation explicitly states the problem (model failures, uncertainty issues). The main idea clearly outlines the proposed framework (Federated Active Learning, Bayesian NNs, uncertainty weighting, targeted annotation). The expected outcomes are specific and measurable (improved generalization, reduced errors). The core concepts are articulated concisely, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the overall approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While Federated Learning, Active Learning, and Bayesian Neural Networks are existing concepts, their specific integration within a single framework tailored for robust medical diagnostics is innovative. The proposed mechanism of using uncertainty estimates from local BNNs to both weight gradients in FL and trigger targeted active learning requests across institutions represents a novel synthesis and application of these techniques. It offers a fresh perspective on collaborative learning and uncertainty management in this domain."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. The core ML components (BNNs, AL algorithms, FL frameworks) exist. However, implementing BNNs at scale can be computationally intensive. More significantly, establishing a federated learning system across multiple hospitals involves substantial logistical, technical (e.g., infrastructure, security, data harmonisation), and administrative hurdles. The active learning loop also requires a robust mechanism for requesting and incorporating annotations efficiently. While technically plausible, the practical deployment requires considerable effort and inter-institutional coordination."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It targets critical issues in clinical AI: model robustness, diagnostic reliability, and the safe application of ML in high-stakes medical decisions. By improving generalization across diverse hospital data, quantifying uncertainty to flag potentially erroneous predictions, and optimizing expert annotation effort, the research could lead to major advancements. Addressing privacy concerns through FL further enhances its relevance. Achieving the projected reduction in diagnostic errors would have a substantial positive impact on patient care."
