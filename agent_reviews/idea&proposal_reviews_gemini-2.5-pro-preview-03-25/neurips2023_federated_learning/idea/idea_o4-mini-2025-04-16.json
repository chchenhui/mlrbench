        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed, including 'Prompt tuning in federated settings', 'Personalization of FL with foundation models', 'Impact of heterogeneity in FL of large models', and 'Resource-efficient FL with foundation models' (specifically communication efficiency). The motivation clearly articulates the challenges of applying foundation models in FL settings (heterogeneity, privacy, communication), which mirrors the core problems highlighted in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It concisely explains the motivation, the core mechanism (combining MAML and prompt tuning in FL, using meta-gradients for a global meta-prompt), the communication efficiency aspect, and the expected outcomes (personalization, robustness, privacy). The integration of specific techniques (MAML, prompt tuning) within the FL framework is clearly articulated, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by proposing a specific combination of existing techniques (Federated Learning, Meta-Learning/MAML, Prompt Tuning) to solve a relevant problem. While federated meta-learning and prompt tuning exist independently, applying MAML specifically to learn an adaptive *initialization* for prompts within an FL framework (FedMetaPrompt) offers a fresh perspective compared to standard federated fine-tuning or federated meta-learning applied to model weights. It targets the unique challenges of adapting foundation models efficiently and personally in FL."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. Prompt tuning involves optimizing a small number of parameters compared to the full foundation model, making local computations manageable. Communicating only prompt vectors and their meta-gradients significantly reduces bandwidth requirements, a key advantage in FL. While MAML can introduce complexity (e.g., second-order gradients, though first-order approximations exist), applying it only to the low-dimensional prompt space makes it much more tractable than applying it to the entire model. Standard FL infrastructure can be adapted for meta-gradient aggregation. Potential challenges might involve tuning the meta-learning process across diverse clients, but overall implementation seems practical with current technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it addresses critical bottlenecks in deploying large foundation models in decentralized, privacy-sensitive environments. Enabling efficient, personalized adaptation of foundation models via FL without sharing raw data or incurring massive communication costs would be a major advancement. It directly tackles heterogeneity and personalization challenges in FL for FMs, potentially leading to more effective and democratized use of these powerful models across various real-world applications where data is distributed and private."
