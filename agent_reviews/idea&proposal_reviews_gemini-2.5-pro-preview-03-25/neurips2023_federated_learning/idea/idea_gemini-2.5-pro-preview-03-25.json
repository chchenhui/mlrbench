    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Prompt tuning in federated settings', 'Resource-efficient FL with foundation models', 'Adaptive aggregation strategies for FL in heterogeneous environments', and 'Personalization of FL with foundation models'. The FedPrompt idea directly addresses all these points by proposing a framework for federated prompt tuning, highlighting its resource efficiency, planning to investigate adaptive aggregation for prompts, and aiming to enable personalization. It fits squarely within the scope and motivation outlined in the task description regarding the challenges and opportunities at the intersection of FL and foundation models."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (high cost of FL fine-tuning), the core mechanism (federated training of only prompt parameters with a frozen base model), the key benefit (reduced communication/computation), and the research direction (adaptive aggregation for prompts) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. It provides a solid understanding of the proposed research."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While prompt tuning and federated learning are existing concepts, their combination, particularly with a focus on specific challenges like adaptive aggregation tailored for prompt vectors in heterogeneous FL settings, is a timely and relatively underexplored research area, as acknowledged by the task description itself. FedPrompt proposes a specific framework for this combination, moving beyond just identifying the possibility. It's not introducing a completely new paradigm but offers a fresh perspective and addresses specific challenges within the FL+FM intersection."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly practical and implementable. Prompt tuning involves training relatively small parameter sets, making local computation feasible even on resource-constrained devices. Communicating only these small prompt vectors drastically reduces the communication bottleneck, a key challenge in FL. Existing FL frameworks can be adapted, and foundation models (open-source or via APIs) are accessible. Investigating adaptive aggregation methods is a standard research task within FL. The core components rely on established techniques, making implementation straightforward."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It directly tackles the critical challenge of adapting large foundation models within the constraints of federated learning (communication overhead, compute limitations, privacy). Enabling resource-efficient adaptation and personalization of foundation models on distributed, private data could unlock widespread practical applications of FMs in sensitive domains and on edge devices. Success would represent a major advancement in making powerful AI models usable in realistic, decentralized scenarios."
