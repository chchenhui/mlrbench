        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task: applying FL to FMs, focusing specifically on the difficulties of fine-tuning (privacy, computation, heterogeneity). The objectives (dynamic aggregation for non-IID data, privacy integration, resource efficiency via prompt tuning) map directly onto the key challenges identified in the literature review and the topics suggested by the task description (e.g., 'Prompt tuning in federated settings', 'Adaptive aggregation strategies', 'Privacy-preserving mechanisms', 'Resource-efficient FL'). The methodology builds upon the cited works (FedBPT, FedDTPT) and aims to tackle the identified gaps."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically. The framework overview and key components (prompt tuning types, dynamic aggregation, privacy mechanisms) are described well, including relevant mathematical formulations for core concepts like prefix tuning, LoRA, weighting, and DP noise. The experimental design is clearly outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise method for obtaining 'feature embeddings' for the dynamic aggregation weighting, and the sensitivity calculation for DP is mentioned but not detailed, but these do not significantly hinder overall understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While federated prompt tuning itself is an active area (as shown by the 2023/2024 literature review), the proposal introduces specific novel elements. The core novelty lies in the proposed 'dynamic prompt aggregation mechanism' based on data diversity quantified via feature embeddings and cosine similarity weighting, which appears distinct from standard FedAvg or the methods in cited works like FedDTPT (which uses attention/clustering). Additionally, the systematic comparison of multiple prompt tuning techniques (Prefix, LoRA, Black-Box) within a unified FL framework that explicitly integrates both secure aggregation (MPC) and differential privacy is a valuable contribution. It's not entirely groundbreaking but offers fresh perspectives and combinations."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages well-established concepts like foundation models, various prompt tuning methods (Prefix, LoRA), federated learning principles, and standard privacy techniques (MPC, DP). The proposed dynamic aggregation mechanism is plausible, using standard similarity metrics and weighting schemes. The application of DP and secure aggregation to prompt updates is technically sound. The experimental design is robust, employing relevant datasets, non-IID simulation, appropriate baselines (including recent related work), and comprehensive evaluation metrics covering accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and privacy. Minor details like embedding generation could be further specified, but the overall approach is well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Simulating the described FL setup (100 clients, 10 GPUs) using standard frameworks like Flower and PyTorch is practical. The required datasets are accessible or can be simulated. Prompt tuning techniques are implementable. Adding DP noise is straightforward. However, implementing secure aggregation (especially MPC beyond simple summation simulation) can be complex and computationally intensive, potentially posing an engineering challenge. Black-box optimization methods can also be slow to converge. Overall, the research plan is realistic within a research context, though some components require careful implementation and may involve moderate effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical bottlenecks hindering the adoption of powerful foundation models in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained decentralized environments (like healthcare and finance), as highlighted in the task description. Successfully developing a resource-efficient, privacy-preserving, and heterogeneity-robust framework for federated prompt tuning would be a major advancement. The expected outcomes (e.g., 90% communication reduction, improved non-IID robustness, formal privacy guarantees) would represent substantial contributions, potentially democratizing access to FM adaptation and accelerating their deployment in regulated industries. The work directly contributes to advancing both FL and FM research."
