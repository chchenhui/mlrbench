        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on 'Interpretability: Using behavioral models to improve the interpretability of AI systems'. This research idea directly addresses this topic by proposing the use of cognitive biases (a core concept from behavioral science) as a framework for interpreting AI failures. It fits squarely within the workshop's goal of integrating insights from behavioral sciences into AI systems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (difficulty in explaining AI failures), the core hypothesis (AI failures might resemble cognitive biases), the proposed method (analyzing model behavior during failures to map them to biases), and the desired output ('bias attribution' for intuitive explanation) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It is immediately understandable what the research aims to achieve."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea has notable originality. While analogies between AI behavior and human cognition/biases have been discussed, the proposal to systematically map specific AI *failure modes* to a *taxonomy of cognitive biases* and develop dedicated methods for 'bias attribution' as an interpretability output offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond simple analogy towards a structured methodology for explanation, combining interpretability techniques with behavioral science concepts in a specific way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents research challenges. Identifying and isolating specific 'failure modes' can be complex. Analyzing internal states of large models is difficult, though standard interpretability techniques can be leveraged. The main challenge lies in rigorously operationalizing cognitive biases computationally and developing robust methods to reliably attribute a specific bias to an observed AI failure pattern, distinguishing it from other potential causes. However, these are research challenges rather than fundamental impossibilities, making it feasible within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. AI interpretability remains a major hurdle, especially for complex models. Current methods often lack intuitive appeal. Providing explanations grounded in familiar concepts like cognitive biases could make AI failures much more understandable to developers and users, facilitating debugging, improving trust, and potentially guiding model refinement. It addresses a critical need for more human-centric AI explanations."
