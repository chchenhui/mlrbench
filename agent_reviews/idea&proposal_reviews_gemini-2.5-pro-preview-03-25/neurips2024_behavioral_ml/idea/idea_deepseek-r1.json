        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core goal of incorporating insights from behavioral sciences (specifically, computational cognitive science using cognitive architectures like ACT-R/CLARION) into AI systems (LLMs). It explicitly targets several listed topics, including 'Computational cognitive science', 'Alignment' (aligning LLMs with models of human cognition/reasoning), and 'Interpretability' (using behavioral models to improve AI interpretability)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (lack of human-like reasoning in LLMs), the main proposal (using cognitive architectures to guide LLM training/inference), the specific methods (hybrid training objective, constrained decoding), and the evaluation strategy (behavioral congruence, perceived naturalness). The concepts are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity, making the research direction immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While integrating cognitive science and AI is an established area, the specific approach of using formal cognitive architectures (ACT-R, CLARION) to actively guide the training process (via hybrid loss) and constrain the inference (via decoding) of large language models represents a fresh and innovative direction. It moves beyond simple fine-tuning on behavioral data towards a deeper integration of cognitive process models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating complex cognitive architectures with large-scale LLM training pipelines is technically demanding. Generating detailed 'cognitive model traces' for diverse tasks and aligning them effectively within a hybrid loss function or constrained decoding mechanism requires substantial expertise in both cognitive modeling and deep learning, significant computational resources, and potentially novel engineering solutions. The complexity of this integration makes it challenging but not necessarily impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the lack of transparent, human-like, and interpretable reasoning in LLMs is a critical challenge for AI safety, alignment, and human-AI collaboration. Successfully grounding LLM reasoning in validated cognitive processes could lead to major advancements in trustworthiness and predictability, particularly in high-stakes domains like education, healthcare, and scientific discovery mentioned in the proposal."
