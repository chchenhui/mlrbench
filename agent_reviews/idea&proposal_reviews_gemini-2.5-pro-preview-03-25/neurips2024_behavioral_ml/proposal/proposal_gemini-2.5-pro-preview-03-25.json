        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes (Alignment, Evaluation, Computational Cognitive Science, Interpretability) by proposing the integration of computational cognitive models (ACT-R) into LLMs. The methodology precisely elaborates on the research idea's core concepts (hybrid training, constrained decoding, cognitive traces). Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape and directly addressing the key challenges identified in the review (Alignment, Scalability, Evaluation, Generalization, Performance/Interpretability balance)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The methodology is detailed, outlining the steps for trace generation, the hybrid loss function (with mathematical formulation), the constrained decoding mechanism (with formulation), and a comprehensive evaluation plan including baselines and specific metrics. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact implementation details of the trace-to-NL mapping or the specific distance/scoring functions for the loss and decoding, but these are acceptable at the proposal stage and acknowledged implicitly as areas for development."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the general idea of integrating cognitive science/architectures with LLMs is gaining traction (as shown in the literature review, e.g., CoALA, LLM-ACTR, Binz & Schulz), this proposal's specific approach appears novel. The key innovation lies in the combined use of explicit, pre-generated cognitive traces from a formal architecture (ACT-R) to guide *both* the training phase (via a specific cognitive alignment loss term, L_{CA}) *and* the inference phase (via a cognitive architecture-constrained decoding mechanism). This dual-pronged approach, focusing on verifiable step-by-step alignment derived from a formal model, distinguishes it from prior work that might focus only on behavioral mimicry, structural frameworks, preference alignment, or different integration techniques (like LLM-ACTR's neuro-symbolic approach)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations from both cognitive science (using established architectures like ACT-R) and machine learning (transformer models, hybrid loss functions, constrained decoding). The proposed methodology is robust, well-justified, and includes appropriate controls (baselines, ablation studies). The technical formulations for the loss function and decoding mechanism are clear and mathematically plausible. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, incorporating task performance, cognitive alignment, behavioral congruence with human data, and user studies for interpretability. Assumptions (e.g., adequacy of ACT-R models, feasibility of trace mapping) are reasonable for a research proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Developing accurate ACT-R models for the selected tasks requires specialized expertise and can be time-consuming. Mapping symbolic cognitive traces to effective natural language representations for LLM guidance is non-trivial. Implementing and tuning the hybrid training objective (balancing \\\\lambda) and the constrained decoding mechanism (implementing state tracking, scoring, tuning \\\\beta) will require significant effort and experimentation. Collecting human behavioral data and running user studies adds logistical overhead. However, the plan to start with specific, well-defined tasks and potentially smaller LLMs makes the scope manageable. With the right expertise (in both LLMs and cognitive modeling) and computational resources, the project is achievable, though ambitious."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations of current LLMs – their opacity and lack of verifiable, human-like reasoning – which are major barriers to trust and safe deployment, especially in high-stakes domains. By aiming to align LLM processes with validated cognitive models, the research has the potential for major advancements in AI alignment, interpretability, and trustworthiness. It offers a principled approach to integrating behavioral science into AI (a core goal of the workshop), potentially leading to more predictable and collaborative AI systems. Success could also provide valuable tools for cognitive science research. The potential impact spans scientific understanding, technological capability, and responsible AI development."
