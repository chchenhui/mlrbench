        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of integrating behavioral science insights (specifically computational cognitive models) into AI systems. The objectives (hybrid training, constrained decoding, evaluation) perfectly match the research idea. The methodology builds upon concepts discussed in the literature review (e.g., aligning LLMs with cognitive models/traces) and targets key workshop themes like Alignment, Interpretability, and Computational Cognitive Science. The problem statement, proposed solution, and evaluation strategy are coherent and consistent across all provided documents."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, significance, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are easy to understand. The core methodological ideas (hybrid loss, constrained decoding) are explained conceptually, and the hybrid loss is even formulated mathematically. However, some technical details could be clearer, particularly regarding the precise nature of the 'cognitive model traces', how the alignment loss (L_cm) is calculated, and how cognitive predictions are generated and integrated during decoding. Despite these minor ambiguities needing refinement in a full paper, the overall proposal is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the general idea of integrating cognitive architectures/models with LLMs is highly relevant and timely, the literature review itself highlights numerous recent papers (2023-2024, even a hypothetical 2025 paper) exploring very similar concepts (e.g., CoALA, LLM-ACTR, cognitive alignment loss, cognitive preference optimization). The proposal combines a hybrid loss and constrained decoding, which is a reasonable approach, but it doesn't strongly articulate how this specific combination or formulation significantly differs from or improves upon the closely related work cited (especially papers 5-10). The novelty appears more incremental, focusing on implementing and evaluating a known promising direction, rather than introducing a fundamentally new concept or technique."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has gaps. The theoretical basis (using cognitive models to improve LLM reasoning/interpretability) is well-motivated. The proposed methods (hybrid loss, constrained decoding) are conceptually plausible and build on existing ML techniques. However, the soundness is weakened by the lack of technical detail regarding the critical cognitive model alignment loss (L_cm) â€“ how are 'traces' represented, compared, and penalized? Similarly, the specifics of generating cognitive predictions for constrained decoding are omitted. The evaluation plan includes standard NLP metrics (Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE) and human evaluation, which is reasonable, but lacks detail on specific tasks or metrics designed to rigorously assess 'human-like reasoning' or 'interpretability' beyond subjective ratings or surface similarity. The reliance on BLEU/ROUGE for reasoning tasks can be questionable."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. It requires significant expertise in both LLMs and cognitive architectures, substantial computational resources for training, and effort for human evaluations. Implementing the core ideas (hybrid loss, constrained decoding) seems technically possible, assuming solutions can be found for defining L_cm and efficiently integrating cognitive model predictions. Key challenges, acknowledged implicitly by the literature review's points, include defining the alignment mechanism effectively, potential computational overhead from the cognitive model during decoding, acquiring suitable datasets, and the cost/effort of human evaluation. These are significant research challenges but don't render the project inherently infeasible for a capable team."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized limitations of current LLMs concerning their lack of transparent, human-like reasoning and interpretability. Successfully integrating cognitive architectures could lead to more trustworthy, understandable, and collaborative AI systems, with major implications for fields like education, healthcare, and human-AI teaming. The research directly contributes to the important interdisciplinary area bridging AI and cognitive science, aligning perfectly with the workshop's aims. The potential for advancing AI alignment and interpretability is substantial."
