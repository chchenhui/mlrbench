        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop call for papers on AGI). It directly addresses multiple key topics: 1. 'Frontiers of AGI research' (proposing a novel architecture for LLMs), 3. 'Interdisciplinary Insights for AGI' (drawing heavily from neuroscience/cognitive science memory models), and 4. 'Fundamental Limitations of LLMs' (explicitly aiming to improve reasoning, planning, and contextual understanding). The core theme of advancing LLMs towards AGI by incorporating human-like cognitive mechanisms fits perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the core concept of integrating three specific memory systems (working, episodic, semantic) into LLMs is clearly presented. The proposed mapping to technical components (attention, retrieval-augmentation, knowledge graphs) provides a good conceptual outline. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanisms of the 'hybrid neuro-symbolic framework' and how these memory systems would interact dynamically, but the overall research direction and goals are understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While integrating cognitive concepts or memory systems into AI isn't entirely new (e.g., cognitive architectures, memory networks), the specific proposal to infuse a hierarchical memory system (working, episodic, semantic) directly into modern LLMs using a hybrid neuro-symbolic approach offers a fresh perspective. Combining retrieval augmentation (episodic) with knowledge graphs (semantic) and attention mechanisms (working) in this structured, cognitively-inspired way presents a novel synthesis relevant to current LLM limitations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible, although ambitious. The individual components proposed have precedents: attention mechanisms are core to Transformers (working memory proxy), retrieval-augmented generation is established (episodic memory), and integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs is an active research area (semantic memory). The main challenge lies in effectively integrating these three distinct systems into a coherent hybrid architecture where they interact synergistically. This requires significant engineering effort and research into the integration mechanisms, but it builds upon existing techniques, making it plausible within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It directly targets fundamental limitations of current LLMs (reasoning, planning, long-term context, hallucination) which are major roadblocks on the path to AGI. Successfully integrating human-like memory systems could lead to substantial improvements in LLM capabilities, making them more robust, adaptable, and capable of complex tasks. Advancing towards models with better memory and reasoning has profound implications for the field and aligns directly with the quest for AGI."
