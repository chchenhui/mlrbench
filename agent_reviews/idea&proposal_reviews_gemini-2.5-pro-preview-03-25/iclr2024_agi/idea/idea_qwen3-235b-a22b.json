        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses Topic 2 ('Classic AGI Attempts as Inspiration', specifically mentioning symbolic AI and Type I/Type II reasoning) and Topic 4 ('Fundamental Limitations of LLMs', focusing on reasoning and planning). It also touches upon Topic 1 ('Frontiers of AGI research') by proposing a novel architecture potentially involving knowledge enhancement. The proposal fits squarely within the workshop's theme of discussing pathways and obstacles towards AGI by tackling LLM limitations through established AI paradigms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation logically sets up the problem (LLM reasoning deficits). The main idea clearly outlines the proposed hybrid architecture, the roles of neural and symbolic components, the function of the meta-controller, the training mechanism (RL), and evaluation strategy. The expected outcomes and impact are also articulated concisely. There is very little ambiguity about the core concept."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches have been explored for decades. However, the specific proposal to integrate modern large-scale neural networks (like LLMs) with symbolic modules using a reinforcement-learning-trained meta-controller, explicitly framed within the cognitive science concept of Type I/Type II reasoning for AGI, offers a contemporary and relevant synthesis. While the core concept of combining neural and symbolic methods isn't groundbreaking, its specific architectural proposal and application context provide a degree of innovation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating large neural networks with potentially complex symbolic reasoning engines is technically demanding. Training a meta-controller via reinforcement learning to effectively route diverse tasks between these systems requires careful design of state/action spaces, reward functions, and substantial computational resources. Defining and implementing robust symbolic modules applicable across various domains is also non-trivial. Developing appropriate benchmarks that genuinely require both reasoning types adds another layer of difficulty. While conceptually plausible, practical implementation faces considerable hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Addressing the limitations of current LLMs in systematic reasoning, planning, and causal inference is a critical challenge in the pursuit of AGI. A successful hybrid architecture that effectively combines the strengths of neural pattern recognition and symbolic logic could represent a major advancement, leading to more capable, reliable, and potentially interpretable AI systems. It tackles a fundamental bottleneck discussed widely in the field."
