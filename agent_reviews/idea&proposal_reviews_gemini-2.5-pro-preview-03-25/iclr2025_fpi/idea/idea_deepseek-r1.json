        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly focuses on 'sampling from an unnormalized distribution' and lists 'Sampling from generative models (diffusion model and LLMs) weighted by target density: i.e. fine-tuning, inference-time alignment' as a key research topic for the Research Papers track. The proposed idea directly addresses inference-time alignment for LLMs using a diffusion-based sampling approach guided by a target density (reward model), fitting squarely within the workshop's scope and stated interests."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (avoiding costly fine-tuning, enabling dynamic alignment) and the core concept (diffusion-inspired sampler guided by a reward model at inference time) are well-explained. Key components like the transition kernel, token-level diffusion, and reward-aware proposal are mentioned. However, some technical details remain high-level (e.g., the exact nature of the 'diffusion-inspired' process for tokens, the specifics of the 'gradient-based updates akin to Langevin dynamics' in this context), leaving minor ambiguities that would require further elaboration in a full paper."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While inference-time alignment and diffusion models for generation exist separately, applying a diffusion-based *sampling* mechanism specifically for *inference-time alignment* of LLMs, guided by an arbitrary reward model without modifying base model weights, represents a fresh approach. Training a specific transition kernel for the joint distribution and incorporating token-level diffusion with learned schedules are innovative elements within this context. It combines existing concepts (diffusion sampling, reward guidance, LLM alignment) in a novel configuration to address limitations of current methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It relies on adapting diffusion principles to discrete token sequences, which is an active but complex research area. Training the transition kernel requires careful design and computational resources, although the proposal suggests it might be less costly than full RLHF. A key challenge will be ensuring the iterative sampling process is computationally efficient enough for practical inference-time use compared to standard generation or other alignment techniques. While plausible using current ML knowledge, successful implementation and achieving the claimed efficiency require careful engineering and validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. LLM alignment is a critical area for ensuring safety, reliability, and controllability. Current methods like RLHF are resource-intensive and static post-training. An effective inference-time alignment method that avoids retraining offers substantial benefits in terms of cost, flexibility, and adaptability (e.g., tailoring models to specific users or contexts dynamically). If successful, this approach could provide a major advancement in how LLMs are controlled and aligned, impacting both research and practical deployment."
