    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on sampling from unnormalized distributions (LLM alignment via target density sampling) and fits squarely into the 'Research Papers' track. It faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the methodology and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to build upon or differentiate itself from recent works mentioned in the literature review (DiffPO, Sampling Demons, SMC-based methods), demonstrating a clear understanding of the context and prior work."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes). The problem formulation, core concepts (token-level diffusion, reward guidance, adaptive scheduling, proposal distribution), training/inference procedures, and experimental plan are well-defined and generally easy to understand. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise mathematical formulation of the token embedding diffusion space and the robustness details of surrogate gradients, but these do not significantly hinder overall comprehension."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the core idea of using diffusion/sampling for inference-time alignment exists in the literature (as acknowledged by citing DiffPO, Sampling Demons, SMC), the proposal claims novelty through its specific combination of techniques: a token-level diffusion process (contrasting with sentence-level like DiffPO), adaptive noise scheduling based on reward, and a specific reward-aware proposal distribution for efficiency. However, the literature review includes a paper (paper 9) with a nearly identical title and summary from 2023, which significantly questions the originality of the fundamental concept if that paper is indeed highly similar. Assuming the specific implementation details and combination (token-level, adaptive schedule, proposal network) provide sufficient distinction, the novelty is adequate but not groundbreaking. Stronger differentiation from potentially overlapping prior work is needed."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on established theoretical foundations (diffusion models, Langevin dynamics, target density sampling). The proposed methodology, including token-level diffusion, Langevin-inspired updates, adaptive scheduling, and the reward-aware proposal, is conceptually plausible. The use of surrogate gradients for discrete tokens is acknowledged as a challenge and addressed with standard techniques (perturbations, finite differences), although their practical stability and accuracy need empirical validation. The technical formulations (equations for target density, diffusion steps, gradient decomposition, loss functions) appear mostly correct and clearly presented. Minor gaps exist in justifying the specific form of the adaptive schedule and fully analyzing the surrogate gradient approximation's limitations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Key hurdles include effectively managing diffusion in the token embedding space and ensuring reliable mapping back to discrete tokens, the computational cost and potential instability of surrogate gradient estimations, and the overall latency of the iterative denoising process during inference. While leveraging existing preference datasets for training is feasible, the claim of 'minimal computational overhead' compared to fine-tuning seems optimistic and requires strong empirical evidence. The experimental plan is comprehensive but demanding. Significant engineering effort and computational resources would be required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of LLM alignment, aiming to overcome major limitations of current methods like RLHF (cost, inflexibility). Developing an efficient, flexible inference-time alignment method would be a major advancement, enabling dynamic adaptation to user preferences, safety constraints, and evolving standards without expensive retraining. The potential practical applications (on-demand alignment, safety, personalization) and broader impacts (reduced environmental cost, democratization) are substantial and highly relevant to the AI community."
