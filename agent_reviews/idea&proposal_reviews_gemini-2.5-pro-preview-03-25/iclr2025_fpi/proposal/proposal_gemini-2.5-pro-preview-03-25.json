    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FPI workshop's theme of sampling from generative models (LLMs) weighted by a target density for inference-time alignment. It systematically expands on the core research idea, detailing the proposed methodology. Furthermore, it appropriately situates the work within the provided literature review, acknowledging recent related methods (DiffPO, SMC-based, Sampling Demons) and aiming to build upon them. The objectives and significance clearly tie back to the workshop's focus on learning-based sampling and its challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It follows a logical structure, making it easy to understand the background, objectives, methodology, evaluation plan, and expected impact. The problem statement is precise, and the proposed 'Diffusion Alignment Sampler (DAS)' method is explained with sufficient technical detail, including the theoretical basis, algorithmic steps, and handling of different reward types. The experimental design is comprehensive and clearly outlined. Minor ambiguities regarding the specifics of the denoising model training or the 'lightweight proposal' exist but do not significantly detract from the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the specific formulation of the 'Diffusion Alignment Sampler (DAS)' framework and its application to LLM embeddings might offer unique aspects, the core concept of using diffusion principles or related iterative refinement techniques for inference-time alignment guided by rewards is an active area of research, as evidenced by the recent literature cited (e.g., DiffPO, Kim et al. 2025, Yeh et al. 2024, Uehara et al. 2025 review). The proposal seems to adapt and combine existing ideas (embedding-space diffusion, score-based guidance, potentially SMC) rather than introducing a fundamentally groundbreaking mechanism. The novelty lies more in the specific implementation choices, the focus on LLMs, and the planned empirical investigation within this emerging field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established principles of diffusion models, probabilistic sampling, and guided generation techniques. The mathematical formulation for sampling from the target density is appropriate. The proposed methodology, adapting techniques like score-based guidance from image diffusion to LLM embeddings, is logical. The experimental plan is rigorous, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Potential weaknesses lie in the inherent challenges of applying continuous diffusion models to discrete text generation via embeddings and ensuring the effectiveness and stability of reward gradient estimation and guidance in this high-dimensional space, but the proposed approach is theoretically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current machine learning technology. It leverages existing pre-trained LLMs and builds upon known diffusion model frameworks. The components (embedding, denoising network, gradient estimation) are implementable. However, a significant challenge, acknowledged by the proposal (Objective 3) and the literature, is the computational cost (inference latency) of iterative diffusion processes, especially for generating long text sequences. Achieving practical efficiency competitive with other methods (like fine-tuned models or simpler inference-time techniques) is a key uncertainty that affects feasibility for real-world deployment. Training the denoising model also requires resources, though likely less than full LLM fine-tuning."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the LLM field: developing flexible, efficient, and adaptable alignment methods beyond costly and static fine-tuning (RLHF/DPO). Success would offer a valuable alternative paradigm for controlling LLM behavior, enabling dynamic adaptation to safety constraints, user preferences, or task requirements. The research directly contributes to the FPI workshop's themes by exploring advanced learning-based sampling techniques for challenging distributions. It has strong potential for both scientific impact (understanding diffusion for text control, sampling methods) and practical impact (safer AI, personalized assistants, controllable content generation)."
