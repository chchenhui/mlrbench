    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FPI workshop's focus on sampling from unnormalized distributions, specifically applying it to inference-time alignment of LLMs, which is listed as a key application area. The proposal faithfully elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the motivation, main concepts (diffusion-inspired sampling, reward guidance, avoiding retraining), and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it explicitly references papers from the literature review (DiffPO, Demon, SMC methods) and positions the proposed work to address the identified challenges like computational efficiency, reward function design, and stability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, significance, and overall methodology are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The motivation for avoiding RLHF and pursuing inference-time alignment is well-explained. The mathematical formulation provides a basic structure for the diffusion process and guidance integration. However, some key aspects mentioned in the research idea, such as the specifics of the 'learned noise schedules' and the 'lightweight reward-aware proposal distribution', are not detailed sufficiently in the methodology section, leaving some ambiguity about the precise technical innovations."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While inference-time alignment using diffusion models is an active area of research (as evidenced by the literature review, including papers like DiffPO, Demon, SMC, and potentially papers [6, 9, 10]), the proposal suggests specific improvements focusing on dynamic sampling strategies, learned noise schedules, and potentially a unique way of integrating gradient-based guidance. However, the core concept of using guided diffusion for alignment isn't entirely new. Paper [9] in the provided literature review shares a very similar title and abstract description, suggesting potential overlap. The novelty seems to lie more in the specific implementation details and the combination of techniques aimed at improving efficiency and stability, rather than a fundamentally groundbreaking concept. The distinction from prior work could be articulated more sharply."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations of diffusion models and guided sampling techniques (akin to score-based guidance or Langevin dynamics within the diffusion steps). The proposed methodology follows standard practices for diffusion models. The mathematical notation for the forward and reverse processes and the gradient guidance term is generally correct. However, the proposal lacks specific details on how the 'adaptive noise schedule' would be learned or how the 'reward-aware proposal distribution' would be formulated and integrated, making it difficult to fully assess the rigor of these novel components. Additionally, while acknowledging stability issues, the proposed solutions are not fully concrete. The implicit assumption that gradient-based guidance requires differentiable rewards might conflict with the goal of handling complex objectives, an aspect addressed by methods like Demon, which isn't fully reconciled in the proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core techniques (diffusion models, LLMs, gradient-based methods) are standard in the field. Inference-time alignment avoids the massive cost of retraining LLMs, making it inherently more feasible than RLHF in terms of training resources. The experimental plan involving benchmark datasets, standard metrics, and comparison against relevant baselines (RLHF, DiffPO) is practical. Potential challenges include the computational cost of the iterative diffusion sampling (achieving 'real-time' alignment might be difficult depending on the number of steps) and ensuring the stability of the guided generation process. However, these seem like research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Addressing the challenges of LLM alignment (cost, instability, inflexibility of methods like RLHF) is a critical problem in AI research and deployment. Developing efficient, effective inference-time alignment methods would have a substantial impact, enabling dynamic adaptation of models to safety constraints, user preferences, or specific tasks without costly retraining. This aligns perfectly with the need for more controllable and adaptable AI systems. The research contributes directly to the workshop's theme by exploring advanced sampling techniques for complex, reward-weighted distributions relevant to LLMs."
