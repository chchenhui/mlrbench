    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'sampling from generative models (diffusion model and LLMs) weighted by target density' for 'inference-time alignment'. The methodology clearly builds upon the provided research idea, elaborating on the diffusion-inspired sampler, reward guidance, and transition kernel. Furthermore, it positions itself effectively against the cited literature (DiffPO, Demon, SMC), aiming to improve upon existing inference-time alignment techniques and tackle challenges mentioned in the review, such as efficiency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific, and the overall methodology (token-level diffusion, reward-aware kernel, adaptive noise) is presented logically. The mathematical framework provides the core equations, and the experimental design is well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise handling of discrete tokens within the continuous noise framework and the derivation details of the reverse kernel, but the main concepts and plan are understandable with good clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While inference-time alignment using diffusion ideas is an active area with related works cited (DiffPO, Demon, SMC), this proposal's specific combination of a *token-level* diffusion process, a *learned transition kernel* optimized via KL divergence for the joint distribution, and an *adaptive noise schedule* appears distinct. However, the core concept of reward-guided diffusion isn't entirely new. The novelty lies more in the specific implementation strategy and potential efficiency gains rather than a groundbreaking paradigm shift. The presence of paper #9 in the literature review with a very similar title/abstract slightly weakens the novelty claim, assuming it describes prior work, though it might be a placeholder or the current work is a significant extension."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the established theory of diffusion models and guided sampling methods. The mathematical formulation, including the target distribution, forward/reverse processes, and KL divergence training objective, appears consistent and theoretically justified, drawing parallels to techniques like guided diffusion and Langevin dynamics. The methodology follows logically from these principles. While details on handling discrete data and derivations are omitted, the core technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing pretrained LLMs and standard deep learning techniques. The required computational resources (8xA100 GPUs) are significant but standard for this type of research. Implementing token-level diffusion with gradient guidance and training the kernel is technically complex but achievable. Key risks include the computational cost of reward gradient computation per step (assuming differentiability of r(x)), ensuring stability of the diffusion process over T=10 steps, and effectively tuning the adaptive scheduler. However, the plan is generally realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It tackles the critical problem of LLM alignment, aiming to overcome limitations of existing methods like RLHF. Developing an efficient and flexible inference-time alignment technique would have substantial impact on AI safety, usability, and the democratization of aligned models. The potential for real-time adaptation to dynamic constraints is a key benefit. If the claimed improvements in latency and reward scores are achieved, the contribution to the field would be substantial."
