    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of preference-based learning (PBL) and its application. It explicitly aims to connect theory to practice by identifying a real-world system (healthcare) that can benefit from preference feedback, fulfilling a key objective of the workshop. Healthcare is mentioned in the task description as an area where PBL has shown promise. The idea implicitly touches upon workshop topics like recommender systems and potentially fairness and multi-objective optimization within the healthcare context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, contrasting PBL with traditional numerical ratings. The main idea is broken down into logical steps (Data Collection, Modeling, Recommendation, Evaluation), making the proposed framework understandable. Expected outcomes and potential impact are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific ML techniques to be employed or the exact nature of preference data collection, but the overall concept and workflow are well-defined and comprehensible."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. While the task description notes that PBL has already yielded results in healthcare, this proposal focuses on building a comprehensive framework specifically for personalized treatment recommendations integrating patient and provider preferences. The novelty lies less in inventing fundamentally new PBL algorithms and more in the specific application, integration, and potential refinement of existing techniques for this complex domain. The 4-step methodology itself is standard, but its dedicated application to personalized treatment plans using relative preferences offers room for novel insights and contributions within healthcare informatics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the ML modeling and recommendation algorithm development are technically feasible using existing methods, the data collection aspect is a major hurdle. Gathering high-quality, unbiased preference data from patients and providers at scale, especially through real-world interactions, is difficult due to logistical constraints, privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA), potential biases in elicitation, and the need for strong collaboration with healthcare institutions. Evaluating the system's impact rigorously in a clinical setting also poses practical challenges. Therefore, while conceptually sound, practical implementation requires considerable effort and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Personalized healthcare is a critical area of research with the potential to revolutionize patient care. Improving treatment personalization based on reliable preference data could lead to major advancements in patient satisfaction, adherence, clinical outcomes, and efficient use of healthcare resources. Successfully bridging the gap between PBL theory and practical healthcare applications, as proposed, would represent a major contribution with substantial real-world benefits."
