        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core concept of combining multi-objective optimization and preference-based RL for healthcare, as outlined in the research idea. It incorporates recent findings and addresses key challenges (balancing objectives, preference elicitation, trust, data scarcity, personalization) identified in the literature review, explicitly referencing them. Furthermore, it aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of connecting theory (MORL, PBRL) to practice (healthcare decision support) and touches upon relevant workshop topics (RL, multi-objective optimization)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to specific objectives, significance, detailed methodology, and expected outcomes. The problem is formally defined using MOMDP notation. The proposed MOPBRL-H framework is broken down into understandable steps (Initialization, Elicitation, Modeling/Update, Policy Opt, Iteration). Key concepts are explained, and the rationale for design choices is provided. While some implementation details are high-level (as expected in a proposal), the overall approach and workflow are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While MORL and PBRL are existing fields, the core novelty lies in their specific integration within the MOPBRL-H framework tailored for healthcare. Key innovative aspects include: 1) Learning a *distribution* over clinician preference weights via Bayesian inference on trajectory preferences, rather than a single reward function or point estimate for weights. 2) Explicitly using this learned distribution to guide the MORL policy search towards relevant regions of the Pareto front. 3) Applying this comprehensive approach to complex chronic disease management simulations. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from standard PBRL (single objective) and standard MORL (requires explicit weights) and builds upon recent related work (e.g., Li & Guo, 2024; Zhou et al., 2023) by proposing a more integrated framework focused on weight distributions."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (MOMDPs, RL, PBRL, Bayesian Inference, Pareto Optimality). The proposed methodology, including the iterative loop of preference elicitation, weight distribution update, and guided MORL, is logically coherent and technically plausible. The use of standard preference models (Bradley-Terry) and Bayesian updates is appropriate. The strategies for guiding MORL using the weight distribution are sensible. The technical formulations provided (MOMDP definition, preference probability) are correct. Minor potential weaknesses include the computational complexity of Bayesian inference and MORL, and the assumption that the objective reward *vector* R is known/estimable, which might be challenging for certain qualitative objectives in real healthcare scenarios, but the core approach is well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. It leverages established RL algorithms, preference learning techniques, Bayesian methods, and available simulation environments (like the T1D simulator). The initial validation relies on simulation, including simulated clinician preferences, which bypasses immediate hurdles of real-world data collection and ethics. Integrating the different components will require significant engineering effort, but it is within the scope of typical ML research projects. The main risks involve computational cost and the fidelity of the simulation, but the overall plan is realistic and implementable in a research setting."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in applying AI/RL to healthcare: aligning decision support systems with complex, multi-objective clinical reasoning without requiring explicit reward functions. Success could lead to more trustworthy, personalized, and clinically relevant CDS tools for chronic disease management, potentially improving patient outcomes. Methodologically, it contributes novel techniques at the intersection of MORL and PBRL, particularly regarding learning and utilizing preference weight distributions, which could be influential beyond healthcare. It directly tackles key challenges identified in the literature and aligns strongly with the workshop's aims."
