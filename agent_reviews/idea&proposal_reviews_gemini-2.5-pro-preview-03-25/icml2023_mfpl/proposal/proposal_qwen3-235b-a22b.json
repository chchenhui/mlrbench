        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (focusing on preference-based learning, RL, multi-objective optimization, and healthcare applications), the research idea (directly elaborating on combining MOPBRL for healthcare, using Pareto fronts, preference elicitation, and personalization), and the literature review (integrating and citing relevant recent works like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10] and addressing the identified key challenges). It successfully translates the core idea into a detailed plan situated within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes). Objectives are explicitly stated. The problem formulation, algorithmic steps (preference elicitation, reward learning, policy optimization, personalization), and experimental design are articulated precisely with appropriate mathematical notation. While minor details could be expanded (e.g., specifics of GA implementation), the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating preference-based learning (specifically learning objective weights from trajectory comparisons) directly with multi-objective RL to generate a Pareto front of policies for clinical decision support. While components like PBRL [1], MO-RL [7], and personalization [5] exist, their synthesis into a unified MOPBRL framework that learns a *distribution* over weights from preferences and incorporates patient-specific adaptation via meta-learning is innovative. It clearly distinguishes itself from single-objective PBRL and standard MO-RL approaches with fixed weights."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (MDPs, Bradley-Terry model, Pareto optimality, Bayesian inference, PPO). The proposed methodology is robust, employing established techniques for preference learning, reward inference, policy optimization, and personalization. Mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines ([3, 7]), diverse metrics (HV, FI [2], clinical relevance), and considerations for validation on both simulated and real-world data."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. The core algorithms (PPO, NNs, GAs) are implementable, and simulated/EHR data sources are accessible (though EHR requires approvals/processing). However, collecting reliable preference data from a sufficient number of clinicians requires significant logistical effort and careful interface design. Integrating the multiple complex components (preference elicitation, reward learning, MO policy optimization, meta-learning personalization) effectively and tuning the system presents a moderate challenge. While the plan is realistic, successful execution depends heavily on managing the preference collection process and system integration complexity."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical gap in applying RL to healthcare by tackling the challenge of multi-objective decision-making and aligning with clinical reasoning through preferences, rather than explicit reward specification. Success would yield more transparent, personalized, and potentially trustworthy clinical decision support tools. It offers substantial contributions to both PBRL theory (extension to MO settings) and healthcare AI practice. The potential impact on improving treatment optimization and clinician-AI collaboration is high."
