    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of preference-based learning, reinforcement learning, multi-objective optimization, and real-world applications (healthcare). It faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the motivation and core concepts. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning the work within the current state-of-the-art and explicitly aiming to tackle challenges identified in the review, such as balancing multiple objectives and eliciting preferences in healthcare."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a precise mathematical formulation of the MO-MDP, the preference elicitation model, the Bayesian inference approach, and the policy learning algorithm, including helpful pseudocode. The experimental design is detailed with specific datasets/simulators, baselines, metrics, and a clear protocol. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving minimal room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by integrating multi-objective RL with preference-based learning through Bayesian inference over scalarization weights to approximate a Pareto front. While MO-RL and PbRL are established fields, and recent works (cited in the proposal) explore their intersection, the specific approach of maintaining a posterior distribution over weights inferred from preferences and using samples from this posterior to train a set of diverse policies simultaneously presents a distinct and innovative contribution. The application to personalized chronic disease management further enhances its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound theoretical foundations, leveraging established frameworks like MO-MDPs, Bayesian inference (BTL models, posterior updates), and actor-critic RL algorithms. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The proposed methodology, involving preference elicitation, weight inference, and multi-policy training, is logical and well-justified. Minor potential weaknesses include the complexity of analyzing the convergence of the entire interactive loop and the inherent assumption that preferences can be perfectly captured by linear scalarization, but the core approach is rigorous and technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires significant expertise in RL, MOO, and Bayesian methods, along with access to either substantial EHR data or reliable clinical simulators (like the mentioned UVA/Padova). Eliciting preferences from clinicians can be time-consuming and costly, although using simulated oracles is a proposed mitigation. Training multiple policies concurrently will be computationally demanding. However, the plan to use simulation environments for development and evaluation significantly enhances feasibility and mitigates risks associated with real-world deployment during research."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in healthcare AI: developing decision support systems that can handle multiple conflicting objectives and align with clinician preferences, moving beyond simplistic reward engineering. Success would represent a major advancement in creating more personalized, transparent, and trustworthy AI for chronic disease management, a field with substantial societal impact. The framework's potential generalizability to other multi-objective decision-making domains further underscores its significance. The expected contributions to MO-RL and PbRL theory and practice are substantial."
