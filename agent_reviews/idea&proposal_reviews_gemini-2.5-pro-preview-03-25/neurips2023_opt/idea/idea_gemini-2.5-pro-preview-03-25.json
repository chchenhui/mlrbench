        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (OPT 2024 workshop focus on 'Scaling up optimization'). It directly addresses the key question posed: 'given a fixed compute budget, how should one choose the hyper-parameters of the model (e.g., width size, depth size, architecture, batch) so as to minimize the loss function?'. Furthermore, it leverages 'scaling laws' as its core mechanism, another central theme highlighted in the task description. The motivation concerning the cost of training large models like LLMs also matches the workshop's context precisely."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly. The motivation, the core methodology (training small models, fitting parameterized scaling laws, using extrapolation in a budget-aware search), and the expected outcome are well-articulated and easy to understand. The specific components (architecture, optimizer settings, compute budget, search algorithms) are identified. While the exact functional form of the scaling laws or the precise parameterization details might require further elaboration in a full proposal, the overall concept and workflow are crystal clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While concepts like Neural Architecture Search (NAS), Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO), and using scaling laws exist individually, this proposal integrates them in a specific and innovative way. The core novelty lies in using *extrapolated* scaling laws, derived from *cheap, small-scale runs*, as a proxy function within a budget-aware search algorithm to *co-optimize* both neural architecture and optimizer hyperparameters simultaneously. This specific combination and application focus, particularly the budget-constrained co-search guided by parameterized extrapolations, offers a fresh approach compared to typical NAS/HPO methods or simpler scaling law applications."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current ML techniques and computational resources. Training smaller models, fitting empirical models (scaling laws), and employing search algorithms like Bayesian Optimization or Evolutionary Algorithms are all standard practices. However, the feasibility score is tempered because the success heavily relies on the accuracy of *extrapolating* the scaling laws. Extrapolation is inherently challenging, especially when laws are parameterized by complex factors like architecture and optimizer settings. Poor extrapolation accuracy could render the search ineffective. Therefore, while the components are feasible, achieving reliable performance prediction via extrapolation poses a moderate implementation risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance and potential impact. It tackles the critical and costly problem of configuring large-scale machine learning models, particularly relevant in the era of LLMs. Finding efficient methods to determine optimal architectures and hyperparameters under compute constraints could lead to substantial savings in time, computational resources, energy consumption, and cost, directly aligning with the impacts mentioned in the task description (saving time/money, reducing environmental impact). A successful outcome could significantly influence how large models are developed and optimized in both academia and industry."
