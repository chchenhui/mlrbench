        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Scaling up optimization', focusing on LLMs and questions like 'Are there natural model size dependent learning rates that allow extrapolation from smaller models to large ones?' and 'scaling laws'. The proposed idea directly addresses this by aiming to derive adaptive learning rate scaling laws based on model size and architecture, using smaller models to extrapolate schedules for larger ones, fitting perfectly within the 'Scaling laws' and 'Deep learning optimization' topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (resource-intensive LLM training, inefficient LR schedules), the main goal (systematic approach for adaptive LR scaling laws), the proposed methodology (integrating spectral analysis of Hessian with empirical observations across scales for extrapolation), and the expected outcome (reduced training time, open-source library). The core concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While learning rate schedules and scaling laws are existing concepts, the proposed systematic approach of integrating spectral analysis of the Hessian (related to curvature and optimal step size) with empirical scaling observations specifically to derive *predictive* learning rate laws as a function of model size and architecture is innovative. It moves beyond common heuristic schedules or purely empirical scaling observations towards a more theoretically grounded, predictive framework for a key hyperparameter, aiming to eliminate costly tuning for large models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training a series of models at smaller scales is achievable. However, reliably performing spectral analysis of the Hessian, even for moderately sized models, is computationally demanding. Furthermore, ensuring that the relationships derived from smaller scales accurately extrapolate to vastly larger models is a major research challenge, as scaling behavior can be complex and exhibit phase changes. While conceptually sound, overcoming these technical hurdles requires substantial research effort and computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Training large models efficiently is a critical bottleneck in AI research and deployment, with enormous financial and environmental costs. Finding principled ways to set hyperparameters like the learning rate based on model scale, potentially reducing training time by 25-40% as suggested, would represent a major advancement. It directly addresses the economic and environmental concerns associated with large-scale AI and could significantly accelerate progress in the field."
