        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly focuses on 'Scaling up optimization' and asks 'How dependent are these scaling laws on the optimization algorithm?'. The idea directly addresses this question by proposing to quantify the impact of different optimization algorithms on neural scaling laws and develop practical guidelines. It fits squarely within the workshop's theme and listed topics like 'Scaling laws', 'Deep learning optimization', and 'Adaptive Stochastic Methods'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (gap in current scaling laws), outlines a structured approach (experiments, theoretical model, selection protocol), and specifies expected outcomes (predictors, guidelines). The core concept of 'optimization-centric scaling laws' is immediately understandable, and the steps involved are logical and concise."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While scaling laws and optimization are individually well-studied, the specific focus on systematically isolating, quantifying, and modeling the *optimizer's* contribution to scaling laws, and building a predictive framework around it, offers a fresh perspective. Current scaling law research often focuses more on architecture, data, and compute, treating the optimizer as a secondary factor or fixed choice. Developing a theoretical link between optimizer dynamics and scaling exponents is an innovative direction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant practical challenges. Conducting systematic experiments across multiple model sizes, optimizers, and hyperparameters requires substantial computational resources, potentially exceeding typical academic budgets unless focused on smaller proxies or specific model families. Developing a robust theoretical model linking complex optimizer dynamics to scaling is non-trivial. However, the proposed approach of using smaller proxies to predict larger model behavior enhances feasibility. The creation of the protocol is contingent on the success of the first two steps."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding how optimizers influence scaling is crucial for efficient training of large models, a major bottleneck in modern AI. Success could lead to substantial savings in computational cost, time, and energy by enabling better hyperparameter prediction and optimizer selection for large-scale tasks, directly addressing the goals outlined in the task description. The potential 50%+ reduction in hyperparameter search costs highlights the practical importance."
