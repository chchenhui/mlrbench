        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 theme of 'Scaling up optimization' by focusing on learning rate scaling laws for LLMs, a key question raised in the task description. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the integration of spectral analysis and empirical studies. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and positions itself relative to the recent works cited in the literature review (Li et al. 2025, Xie et al. 2024, Bjorck et al. 2024), aiming to extend them by incorporating spectral properties and architectural details more deeply. All core components are well-integrated and consistent."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to specific objectives, a detailed phased methodology, and expected outcomes. The objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly through the phased approach). The methodology clearly outlines the steps for data collection, model training, spectral analysis, law formulation, validation, and tool development. Technical concepts like spectral estimation methods are mentioned appropriately. The rationale and significance are articulated concisely, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the general area of hyperparameter scaling laws for LLMs is active, as evidenced by the literature review (Li et al. 2025, Xie et al. 2024), this proposal's specific approach offers novelty. The key innovative aspects are the systematic integration of Hessian spectral properties (like max eigenvalue) into the scaling laws and the explicit focus on modeling the influence of architectural dimensions (width W, depth D) beyond just total parameter count (N). This aims for a more mechanistic understanding compared to purely empirical power laws or existing SDE-based models mentioned. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it builds on existing concepts, but the proposed synthesis and focus on spectral/architectural links provide a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in optimization theory (linking LR to Hessian spectrum) and empirical scaling law research. The methodology employs established techniques: systematic model scaling, standard datasets/optimizers, efficient spectral estimation algorithms (Power Iteration, Lanczos), and robust validation procedures with appropriate baselines. The proposed functional forms for scaling laws are plausible starting points. Minor weaknesses include the inherent difficulty in precisely defining/finding the 'optimal' LR even for smaller models and the potential simplification of assuming a direct proportionality between optimal LR and the inverse maximum eigenvalue in the complex LLM optimization landscape. However, the overall approach is technically well-founded and rigorous."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily related to computational resources. Training numerous LLMs across various scales (up to multi-billion parameters), performing HPO for baseline optimal LRs, and estimating Hessian spectral properties repeatedly requires substantial GPU clusters and time. The large-scale validation phase (>10B parameters) is particularly demanding. While the techniques (spectral estimation, model training) are known, applying them at the proposed scale is resource-intensive. There are also risks regarding the reliability of spectral estimates and the generalizability of laws derived from smaller scales. Successful execution heavily depends on access to significant computational infrastructure, making it only satisfactorily feasible under typical academic constraints, though technically possible given sufficient resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in AI development: the immense cost and resource consumption of training large language models, specifically the hyperparameter tuning phase. Successfully developing predictive learning rate scaling laws, especially ones grounded in spectral properties and architectural understanding, could lead to substantial savings in compute time, energy, and cost (estimated 25-40% reduction in tuning cost). This has major economic and environmental implications. Scientifically, it would advance our understanding of optimization dynamics in deep learning. Practically, the proposed open-source tool would be highly valuable to the research community, potentially democratizing large-scale AI research to some extent."
