    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Scaling up optimization' for LLMs, focusing on model size-dependent learning rates, extrapolation, and cost reduction as requested by the task. It systematically elaborates on the research idea of using spectral analysis for adaptive LR scaling. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging recent advancements in LR scaling laws (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024) while proposing a distinct mechanism (spectral analysis and dynamic adaptation) to extend them."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure, clearly defines objectives, and explains the core methodology (theoretical basis, algorithms, validation). Mathematical notation and pseudo-code enhance understanding. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise implementation details for layer-wise Hessian estimation and the theoretical justification for the distributed maximum eigenvalue approximation, but these do not significantly obscure the main thrust of the proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the general area of learning rate scaling laws for LLMs is actively researched (as evidenced by the literature review), the specific approach of using Hessian spectral properties (estimated via Lanczos) as the basis for deriving scaling laws *and* dynamically adapting the learning rate (potentially layer-wise) during training is a novel contribution. It distinguishes itself from purely empirical fitting or SDE-based approaches mentioned in the literature by proposing a concrete optimization-theoretic mechanism."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established optimization principles (LR vs. Hessian eigenvalues) and employs standard, efficient methods for spectral estimation (Lanczos, Hessian-vector products). The proposed power-law hypothesis is plausible, and the validation plan is comprehensive. However, some aspects could benefit from further justification, such as the assumption of constant scaling factors (k), the theoretical basis for the distributed \\\\lambda_{max} approximation (\\max_i \\\\lambda_{max}(H_i)), and the potential stability and computational trade-offs of frequent spectral estimation, especially for layer-wise adaptation. These represent minor gaps rather than fundamental flaws."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Using Lanczos within standard DL frameworks (PyTorch/JAX) is practical. The planned model scales (up to 1-5B parameters) are relevant and achievable for well-resourced labs. However, the crucial factor is the computational overhead of the periodic spectral estimation (Hessian-vector products). While potentially less than full hyperparameter search, this overhead must be carefully managed and optimized to ensure net efficiency gains. Implementing robust and efficient layer-wise and distributed adaptation also presents moderate engineering challenges and risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of efficient LLM training, which has substantial economic ($ millions in compute), environmental (energy consumption), and accessibility implications. Successfully developing reliable, adaptive LR scaling laws based on spectral properties would offer major benefits: reduced training time/cost (estimated 25-40%), lower environmental footprint, democratization of LLM development, and potentially improved model performance. The research also contributes to the fundamental understanding of optimization dynamics in deep learning."
