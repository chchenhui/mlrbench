    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description's focus on 'Scaling up optimization', particularly regarding model size-dependent learning rates, extrapolation, and reducing training costs for LLMs. It directly implements the research idea by proposing a systematic framework based on model dimensions (N, D, S, B) and Hessian analysis. It also clearly builds upon and cites relevant work from the literature review (Li et al., Xie et al., Bjorck et al.), positioning itself as an extension and refinement of existing research on hyperparameter scaling laws. The methodology addresses challenges mentioned in the literature, such as generalization and computational cost (though the proposal itself is costly)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology is broken down into logical, detailed steps (data collection, Hessian analysis, scaling-law fitting, validation), including specific parameters, techniques (stochastic Lanczos, Huber regression), and evaluation metrics. The proposed power-law formula and the algorithmic framework (pseudocode) are presented clearly. The expected outcomes and broader impact are also well-explained. The structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core concept of power-law scaling for learning rates is acknowledged as existing work (Li et al., Xie et al., Bjorck et al.). The novelty lies primarily in the specific combination of predictors (N, D, S, B) in the power law, the explicit integration of Hessian spectral analysis (curvature information via lambda_max) to potentially ground and refine the empirical scaling laws, and the planned systematic validation including cross-architecture generalization (ViT, MLP-Mixer). It represents a thoughtful integration and extension of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established theoretical concepts (Hessian-LR relationship) and empirical findings (power-law scaling). The methodology employs standard and appropriate techniques: controlled experiments for data collection, stochastic Lanczos for Hessian eigenvalue estimation, and robust regression for fitting. The validation plan is comprehensive, including large-scale tests, baseline comparisons, downstream task evaluation, cross-architecture checks, and ablations. The connection proposed between empirical scaling and curvature adds theoretical depth. Minor details, like the precise adaptation of the LR formula for Adam, could be slightly more explicit, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily due to the immense computational cost. The 'Data Collection' phase requires training numerous transformer variants (3x3x3x3=81 configurations) with coarse LR grid searches, which is very expensive even at 'small- to medium-scale'. Hessian estimations add further cost. The 'Large-Scale Validation' on 1B-10B parameter models is extremely resource-intensive. While the individual techniques are standard, the overall resource requirement makes feasibility heavily dependent on access to substantial compute infrastructure. The claimed 25-40% efficiency gain is ambitious and might be difficult to achieve consistently across all settings."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of the enormous computational cost and environmental impact associated with training large language models. By aiming to provide a theoretically grounded, practical method for setting optimal learning rates, it has the potential to drastically reduce training time and expense, lower the barrier to entry for LLM research, and decrease the carbon footprint of AI. Success would represent a major practical advancement in large-scale ML optimization and provide valuable scientific insights into scaling phenomena."
