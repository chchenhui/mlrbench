    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (FITML workshop focus on efficient fine-tuning, theory, scalability, resource constraints), the research idea (Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning based on error analysis for efficiency), and the literature review (building upon PEFT, stability analysis, error-based adaptation methods, and addressing identified challenges). It clearly positions RGFT within the context of existing work and workshop goals, addressing the need for efficient adaptation, theoretical understanding, and empirical validation. All sections, from introduction to expected outcomes, consistently reinforce the core theme of adaptive, resource-efficient fine-tuning guided by error signals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to the proposed solution (RGFT), objectives, methodology, and expected impact. Key concepts like 'error map', 'component', 'error score' (s_k^{(t)}, E_k^{(t)}), and the adaptive learning rate mechanism (\\eta_k^{(t)}) are clearly explained with mathematical formulations. The methodology section provides sufficient detail on residual tracking, error attribution, dynamic updates, theoretical analysis goals, and the experimental setup. The objectives are specific and measurable. There are very few ambiguities, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the core idea of using error or gradient information to guide model updates or sparsification during training/fine-tuning exists in the literature (as acknowledged by citing Doe et al., White et al., Black et al., Fan et al., Orange et al., Cyan et al.), RGFT proposes a specific, cohesive framework. Its novelty lies in the integration of component-level error attribution (via EMA of gradient norms), a specific dynamic update strategy (adaptive component-wise LR scaling), and the explicit goal of providing supporting theoretical analysis for convergence and stability within this fine-tuning context. It represents a thoughtful refinement and combination of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking approach. The emphasis on a unified framework with theoretical backing distinguishes it somewhat."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (gradient-based optimization, fine-tuning, PEFT, adaptive learning rates). Using gradient norms as a proxy for error contribution is a reasonable and common heuristic in sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology (EMA for smoothing, adaptive LR scaling) is technically well-defined. The planned theoretical analysis, referencing relevant work (Fu et al., Grey et al.), addresses appropriate concerns (convergence, stability). The experimental design is comprehensive and includes necessary baselines, metrics, and ablations. Minor potential weaknesses include the inherent limitations of the gradient norm proxy and the complexity of analyzing the proposed adaptive scheme theoretically, but the overall approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The proposed RGFT method (calculating gradient norms per component, EMA, modifying learning rates) can be implemented using standard deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. Accessing per-parameter or per-module gradients is standard functionality. The required datasets are publicly available benchmarks. The main challenge lies in the computational resources needed for the extensive experiments planned (multiple large models, datasets, baselines, ablations), especially if including large LLMs like Llama-2 7B. However, this is typical for research in this area. The methodology itself does not rely on unproven technologies. The scope is ambitious but manageable, potentially by prioritizing certain experiments if resources are constrained."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of efficient fine-tuning for large pre-trained models, which is a major bottleneck in deploying state-of-the-art AI. Successfully developing RGFT could lead to substantial reductions in computational cost (FLOPs, time, energy), making powerful models more accessible and sustainable, particularly in resource-constrained environments (aligning with Cyan et al. and workshop goals). Beyond practical efficiency gains, the research offers potential scientific insights into fine-tuning dynamics through error map analysis and contributes a novel adaptive technique to the PEFT landscape. The alignment with the FITML workshop themes is excellent."
