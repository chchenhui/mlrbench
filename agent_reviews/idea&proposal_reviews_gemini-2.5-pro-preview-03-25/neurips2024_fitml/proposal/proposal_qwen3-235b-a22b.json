    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FITML workshop's focus on new fine-tuning methodologies, efficiency, scalability, theoretical foundations, and empirical results for resource-constrained environments. It elaborates precisely on the core research idea of Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT) using error analysis for adaptive resource allocation. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review (error component identification, dynamic allocation, stability, theoretical guarantees, scalability) and positions itself effectively within the context of the provided papers."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes, Conclusion), and the objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology, including residual tracking, dynamic sparsification, and the theoretical framework, is generally well-explained with supporting formulas. The experimental design is detailed and comprehensive. However, the exact mathematical formulation for calculating layer-wise residual contribution (\\\\mathcal{R}_l^t) could benefit from slightly more precision or justification regarding the dot product's components. Despite this minor point, the overall proposal is easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing concepts highlighted in the literature review (error analysis for fine-tuning, dynamic sparsification, adaptive learning rates, PEFT), it proposes a novel *integration* of these ideas into a specific framework (RGFT). The novelty lies in the combination of backpropagation-based sensitivity analysis for error attribution across components, EMA smoothing for stability, specific adaptive learning rate and sparsification rules tied to this error map, and the associated theoretical convergence analysis. It offers a fresh perspective on adaptive PEFT, clearly distinguishing itself from static methods like LoRA or simpler dynamic approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid theoretical foundations (sensitivity analysis, EMA, Lyapunov stability) and established methods (PEFT, sparsification). The methodology, including adaptive learning rates and threshold-based sparsification, is logically derived from the error analysis. The reference to standard assumptions (Lipschitz smoothness, bounded gradient variance) and a convergence inequality strengthens the theoretical claims, although the specific derivation linking RGFT updates to the inequality would require detailed proof. The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines and metrics. The minor ambiguity in the \\\\mathcal{R}_l^t formula slightly tempers the score, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The core components (backpropagation analysis, EMA, adaptive learning rates, sparsification) are implementable within standard deep learning frameworks. The main potential challenge is the computational overhead of the sensitivity analysis for residual tracking, especially for very large models. However, the proposal mitigates this by suggesting periodic tracking (every 100 steps), making it practical. Access to required datasets, models, and compute resources (GPUs) is standard for this type of research. The experimental plan is realistic, and potential risks like hyperparameter tuning are acknowledged implicitly."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of efficient fine-tuning for large-scale models, which is a major bottleneck for deployment, particularly on resource-constrained devices (edge AI). The potential quantitative improvements (70% FLOP reduction, >5% accuracy gain over static PEFT) are substantial. Success would lead to major advancements in practical model adaptation, contribute to Green AI by reducing computational footprints, and offer valuable interpretability insights via error maps. The research directly aligns with the goals of the FITML workshop and has strong potential for broad impact in the ML community."
