    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FITML workshop's call for new, resource-efficient fine-tuning methodologies, theoretical foundations, and empirical results for efficiency in modern ML. It systematically elaborates on the core research idea of Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT) through error analysis. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and distinguishes itself from the cited literature (e.g., FAIT, Doe et al., PEFT surveys, dynamic sparsification works), explicitly tackling the key challenges identified in the review, such as error identification, dynamic allocation, stability, theory, and scalability. The proposal comprehensively covers the workshop's key topics by offering a new methodology, theoretical analysis (convergence), and extensive empirical validation plans."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure, starting with motivation and objectives, detailing the methodology, and outlining expected outcomes and impact. Key concepts like RGFT, residual error tracking, dynamic sparsification, and adaptive optimization are defined, often with mathematical formulations. The experimental design is particularly well-defined and comprehensive. Minor ambiguities exist, primarily around the precise theoretical justification for the chosen error contribution approximation (\\\\\\hat{E}_i) and the exact nature of the 'quasi-convexity property' mentioned in the convergence analysis. However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing concepts like error-focused fine-tuning (FAIT, Doe et al.), dynamic sparsification (White et al.), and adaptive optimization, RGFT introduces a novel synthesis. Specifically, the proposed mechanism involving (1) approximating component-wise error contribution using gradient and activation norms, (2) using an EMA-smoothed error map to dynamically modulate component-level learning rates via a specific multiplier function, (3) incorporating a progressive sparsification threshold, and (4) providing convergence analysis tailored to this adaptive scheme, represents a fresh approach distinct from fixed PEFT methods or prior adaptive techniques cited. The novelty lies in the specific integrated methodology rather than a completely new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. The motivation is well-grounded in the inefficiency of uniform fine-tuning. The methodology integrates established techniques like EMA smoothing and Adam optimization adaptively. The experimental design is comprehensive and rigorous, including comparisons, ablations, and resource-constrained scenarios. However, the core approximation for error contribution (\\\\\\hat{E}_i) using gradient and activation norms is a heuristic; its validity as a proxy for actual error contribution needs strong empirical validation and potentially stronger theoretical backing. The convergence analysis, while present and valuable, relies on standard assumptions and the O(1/T) rate's dependence on 1/\\\\epsilon highlights a potential trade-off needing exploration. Overall, the approach is plausible but key components require careful validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Implementing the error tracking via framework hooks, calculating norms, and creating a custom optimizer wrapper are standard practices in deep learning research. The claimed computational overhead (<5%) seems plausible for moderately sized models, although scalability to extremely large models is acknowledged as a potential challenge. The extensive experimental plan requires significant computational resources, but this is standard for the field. The main feasibility challenges are potential hyperparameter sensitivity (acknowledged) and managing the computational overhead at scale, but these appear manageable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of resource-efficient fine-tuning for large models, which has major implications for computational cost, energy consumption, accessibility, and environmental sustainability. If successful in achieving comparable performance with significantly reduced computation (claimed 50-70% reduction), RGFT could lead to major advancements in how large models are adapted and deployed, particularly in resource-constrained settings (edge AI) and for democratizing access to state-of-the-art AI. The potential contributions extend to theoretical understanding (adaptive optimization, error propagation) and model interpretability (error maps)."
