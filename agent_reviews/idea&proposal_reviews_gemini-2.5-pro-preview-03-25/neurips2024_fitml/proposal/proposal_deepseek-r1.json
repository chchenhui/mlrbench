        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FITML workshop's focus on fine-tuning efficiency, scalability, theoretical understanding, and new methodologies. The proposal systematically elaborates on the core RGFT idea presented, detailing the mechanisms for residual tracking and dynamic sparsification. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the provided literature, citing relevant papers (e.g., on dynamic sparsification, error analysis, adaptive tuning) and explicitly aiming to tackle the key challenges identified in the review, such as dynamic resource allocation and providing theoretical guarantees."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from introduction and objectives to methodology, expected outcomes, and impact. Key concepts like the Error Contribution Score, adaptive learning rates, and sparsity masks are defined with mathematical formulations. The experimental design is detailed and easy to follow. A minor point of ambiguity is the connection between the initially mentioned 'prediction residuals' (delta_i) and the 'Error Contribution Score' (E_l^(t)), which uses gradient norms; while related, explicitly stating this relationship could enhance clarity slightly. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several existing concepts into a unified framework (RGFT). While ideas like adaptive learning rates based on error/gradient analysis (arXiv:2405.12345), dynamic sparsification (arXiv:2407.98765), and layer-wise analysis (arXiv:2408.76543) exist, RGFT proposes a specific combination: using layer-wise gradient norms to drive both adaptive learning rates *and* hard sparsity masking during fine-tuning. Providing a theoretical convergence analysis for this specific combined mechanism further adds to its novelty. It's not a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift but offers a distinct and well-justified approach compared to individual prior works."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established techniques (gradient norms as importance scores, adaptive learning rates, parameter masking). The proposed methodology, including the Error Contribution Score and the update rule, is technically well-defined. The plan for theoretical analysis, based on extending standard SGD convergence proofs under common assumptions (smoothness, bounded gradients), is appropriate, although the actual proof for the combined adaptive and sparse updates requires careful execution. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, diverse tasks, standard metrics, and ablation studies, indicating methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core method involves calculating layer-wise gradient norms and applying adaptive rates/masks, which is computationally manageable within standard deep learning frameworks, although the gradient norm calculation adds overhead. The use of standard, publicly available datasets simplifies data acquisition. While fine-tuning large models requires significant computational resources, the project's goal is to *reduce* these requirements, making the comparison feasible. The research plan, including theoretical work and extensive experiments, is ambitious but achievable within a typical research context. Potential risks, like the overhead of error tracking or complexity of the proof, seem manageable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the computational cost and efficiency of fine-tuning large neural networks. If successful, RGFT could offer substantial improvements in resource efficiency, enabling wider deployment of large models, particularly on edge devices, and contributing to more sustainable AI practices. The combination of a practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees enhances its potential impact. Providing insights into error propagation and critical model components further adds to its scientific value. The research directly aligns with the key themes of the FITML workshop and has strong potential for impactful contributions to the field."
