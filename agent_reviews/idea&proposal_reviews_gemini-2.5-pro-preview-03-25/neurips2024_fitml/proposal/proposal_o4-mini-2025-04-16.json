    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (focusing on efficient fine-tuning, theoretical understanding, new methodologies, scalability, and resource constraints), the research idea (residual-guided adaptive fine-tuning), and the literature review (acknowledging and positioning itself relative to prior work like FAIT, error-map methods, dynamic sparsification, and theoretical analyses). It directly addresses the workshop's call for principled, scalable, and resource-efficient methods and incorporates the key challenges identified in the literature review."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are specific and measurable (e.g., 50-70% FLOP reduction). The methodology is broken down logically into modules (tracking, scheduling, theory) with clear mathematical formulations and pseudocode. The experimental design is detailed and comprehensive. The expected outcomes and impact are articulated concisely. Only very minor points, like the precise definition of 'ErrorContribution' in the pseudocode (though clarified later) or the exact formulation of the transfer learning bound, could be slightly more explicit upfront."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core concept of using error or residual analysis to guide fine-tuning is present in the cited literature (e.g., FAIT, Doe et al., Black et al., White et al.). The novelty lies primarily in the specific *combination* of techniques: using gradient norms for residual tracking, applying this signal to *both* adaptive sparsification (masking) and adaptive learning rates at the component level, and providing a specific theoretical convergence analysis for this combined approach. While not groundbreaking, this integration and the specific formulation offer a novel refinement over existing methods. The proximity to several cited recent/preprint works slightly limits the perceived originality."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established concepts (SGD, adaptive methods, PEFT). The methodology, including residual tracking via gradient norms and the adaptive update rules, is technically well-defined. The plan for theoretical analysis, referencing and adapting existing convergence proofs (Grey et al., 2023) under standard assumptions, provides a solid foundation, although careful verification of assumptions for the adaptive rates and the implications of hard masking (\\gamma=0) versus the theorem's condition (M_i^{(t)} \\\\ge m_{\\\\min}>0) is needed. The experimental design is rigorous, featuring relevant baselines, diverse tasks, comprehensive metrics, ablation studies, and statistical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. The core algorithmic components (gradient norm calculation, EMA, masking, adaptive LR) are computationally feasible and can be integrated into standard deep learning frameworks (PyTorch/HuggingFace). The use of standard datasets and models simplifies setup. The proposal mentions access to necessary compute resources (A100 cluster, Jetson edge devices). The main challenges are likely hyperparameter tuning and potentially managing the computational overhead of per-component gradient norm calculations efficiently, but these seem manageable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the critical and timely problem of efficient fine-tuning for large models, which is crucial for scalability, accessibility, and deployment in resource-constrained settings (like edge devices). If the claimed efficiency gains (up to 70% FLOP reduction) are achieved while maintaining performance, the impact would be substantial. The work also promises theoretical insights into adaptive fine-tuning dynamics and practical guidance for future PEFT methods."
