        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task description. It directly addresses the need for 'expeditious and resource-efficient inference and fine-tuning methods' and 'deployment within constrained computational resources'. It proposes a 'new methodology for fine-tuning' focusing on efficiency ('sparse representation' via dynamic sparsification) and mentions both 'theoretical foundations' (convergence guarantees) and 'empirical results' (performance with reduced computation). The focus on adaptive learning based on error analysis fits well within the scope of advancing 'modern practices for efficiency in machine learning'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the core concept of Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT) using an 'error map' to guide updates is understandable. The key components (residual tracking, dynamic sparsification, theoretical framework) are listed. However, some details could be more precise, such as the exact mechanism for calculating component-wise error contributions and how the dynamic sparsification strategy translates error levels into learning rate adjustments or parameter freezing. Despite these minor ambiguities, the overall proposal is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While adaptive learning rates and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques exist, the specific approach of using prediction *residuals* to create a dynamic 'error map' guiding the *intensity* of fine-tuning across different model components (layers, heads) appears relatively novel. It offers a specific mechanism for adaptivity focused on error analysis, distinct from methods like LoRA or adapter modules which modify architecture, or simple layer-wise learning rate decay. The combination of residual tracking, error-based dynamic sparsification, and a supporting theoretical framework presents a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea seems largely feasible. Tracking residuals requires additional computation during training passes, but this is likely manageable within standard deep learning frameworks. Implementing adaptive learning rates or dynamic sparsification based on tracked metrics is technically achievable. Developing the theoretical framework for convergence is a standard research task, albeit potentially challenging. Experimental validation involves standard comparison protocols. The claimed 70% computation reduction requires robust empirical validation, but the underlying mechanisms proposed are practical to implement and test."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Efficient fine-tuning is a critical bottleneck for deploying large models, especially in resource-constrained environments (edge computing, limited budgets). Achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning with substantially reduced computational cost (as claimed) would be a major advancement. Furthermore, understanding which parts of a model contribute most to errors during fine-tuning could offer valuable insights into the adaptation process. The potential impact on both practical deployment and theoretical understanding of fine-tuning is substantial."
