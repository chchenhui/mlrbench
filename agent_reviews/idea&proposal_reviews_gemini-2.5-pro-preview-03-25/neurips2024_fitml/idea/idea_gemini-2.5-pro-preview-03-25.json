        "justification": "The idea directly addresses key themes of the FITML workshop. It proposes a new methodology for fine-tuning (specifically PEFT/LoRA), focuses on resource efficiency (parameter budget), targets LLMs, and aims to improve performance within constrained computational resources. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's call for 'expeditious and resource-efficient inference and fine-tuning methods', 'exploration of new methodology for fine-tuning... from low-rank representation... to LLMs', and 'advancing modern practices for efficiency in machine learning'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (suboptimal fixed rank in LoRA), the core concept (dynamic rank allocation based on utility metrics), the mechanism (iterative reallocation), and the goal (task-specific optimal rank distribution) are well-explained. Examples of utility metrics are provided. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact algorithm for reallocation (e.g., frequency, specific update rules) and the precise calculation/comparison of utility metrics, but the overall proposal is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality within the PEFT domain. While PEFT methods like LoRA and the concept of adaptive parameters exist, applying dynamic rank *reallocation* during fine-tuning based on learned importance metrics specifically for LoRA-like modules is a novel approach. It extends existing fixed-rank methods by introducing task-specific adaptivity to the rank structure itself, going beyond simply finding a single optimal fixed rank. It combines existing concepts (PEFT, importance metrics, adaptivity) in a new way relevant to efficient fine-tuning."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. It relies on monitoring metrics like gradients (readily available) or approximations of Fisher information/importance scores, which are computable. The main challenge lies in implementing the dynamic reallocation mechanism, potentially involving resizing matrices and managing optimizer states efficiently within standard deep learning frameworks. While this adds complexity compared to standard LoRA, it doesn't seem insurmountable with current technology and software libraries. The computational overhead needs evaluation but is likely manageable if reallocation isn't performed too frequently."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning is critical for adapting large models. Automatically optimizing the rank allocation across layers could lead to substantial improvements in the performance-efficiency trade-off compared to manually tuned fixed-rank approaches. If successful, AdaRank could enable better model performance for a given parameter budget or achieve similar performance with fewer parameters, directly contributing to more efficient and accessible fine-tuning of large models, a key goal in the field."
