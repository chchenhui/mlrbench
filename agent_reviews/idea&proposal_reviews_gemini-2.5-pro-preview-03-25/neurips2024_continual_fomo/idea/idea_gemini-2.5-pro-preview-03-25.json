        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Scalable Continual Learning for Lifelong Foundation Models'. Specifically, it tackles key workshop topics such as: 1) Utilizing CL methods to avoid retraining large FMs (by using PEFT adaptively). 2) Addressing catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning FMs on smaller/domain-shifted datasets. 3) Proposing a scalable approach suitable for large models. 4) Incorporating insights from meta-learning (via the meta-controller). 5) Leveraging recent advances in FMs (PEFT) to enhance CL techniques. The focus on parameter efficiency and preventing forgetting in FMs fits perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-defined. The motivation (forgetting in FMs, limitations of existing methods) is clear. The main proposal (Adaptive Parameter Allocation - APA) is explained with its key components: dynamic parameter budget allocation based on task properties, guidance by a meta-controller predicting forgetting, and orthogonalization constraints. The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise architecture of the meta-controller or the exact mathematical formulation of the orthogonalization, but the overall concept and approach are well-articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using PEFT methods like LoRA/Adapters for CL is an emerging area, the core novelty lies in the *adaptive* nature of parameter allocation. Instead of fixed-size PEFT modules per task, APA proposes dynamically determining the budget based on task complexity/similarity and predicted forgetting using a meta-controller. Furthermore, the explicit introduction of orthogonalization constraints between task-specific PEFT parameter subspaces to minimize interference is a specific and innovative mechanism within this context. This combination represents a fresh approach compared to simply adding fixed PEFT modules sequentially or applying traditional CL methods directly to FMs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with current technology and knowledge. It builds upon established PEFT techniques (LoRA, Adapters) which are widely used and implemented. Training a small meta-controller is computationally feasible. Implementing orthogonalization constraints, while adding some complexity, is a known technique in deep learning (e.g., via regularization terms in the loss function). Defining task complexity/similarity metrics and designing the meta-controller effectively are engineering challenges, but they do not seem insurmountable. The approach avoids full model retraining, contributing to its feasibility at the scale of FMs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Catastrophic forgetting is a major obstacle to creating truly adaptive, lifelong learning AI systems, especially with large-scale Foundation Models where retraining is prohibitively expensive. This proposal directly targets this critical problem by aiming for efficient knowledge accumulation and retention across sequential tasks. If successful, APA could provide a scalable and parameter-efficient solution, enabling FMs to be updated continuously, which would be a major advancement for the field and have substantial practical implications for deploying evolving AI models."
