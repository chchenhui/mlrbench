    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme of Scalable Continual Learning for Lifelong Foundation Models. It directly addresses key topics mentioned in the call for papers, specifically: (1) How CL methods can avoid retraining large FMs by proposing an efficient update mechanism, and (2) How to address catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning FMs, which is the core motivation of the idea. The focus on efficiency ('Adaptive Knowledge Pruning', 'reduce computational requirements') aligns perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on scalability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated. The motivation is well-explained, outlining the problem of catastrophic forgetting and the limitations of current CL approaches for FMs. The proposed three-step approach (importance scoring, adaptive pruning, sparse fine-tuning) is presented logically. The goal of balancing knowledge preservation and adaptation while improving efficiency is explicit. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific mechanisms for 'importance scoring' and how 'critical knowledge pathways' are precisely defined and differentiated from task-specific ones, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While pruning and importance scoring are established techniques, their application *dynamically and adaptively* within a continual learning framework specifically for large foundation models is innovative. It differs from static pruning applied post-training or pre-training, and offers a distinct mechanism compared to common CL strategies like regularization (EWC, SI), replay, or parameter isolation (adapters, LoRA). The combination of identifying core knowledge pathways, pruning less critical ones to create capacity, and then sparsely fine-tuning these pathways represents a novel approach to managing plasticity and stability in large models during CL."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Techniques for importance scoring (e.g., based on gradients, activations, Fisher information), network pruning, and sparse updates exist. However, implementing these *adaptively* during the continual learning process requires careful design. Determining the right thresholds for pruning, ensuring stability, and verifying that pruned pathways can effectively learn new information without negatively impacting core knowledge are significant research questions. Conducting experiments on large FMs requires substantial computational resources, but is within the realm of possibility for ML research labs. The integration of these components into a robust framework is non-trivial but achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. It addresses two critical challenges in the field: catastrophic forgetting and the computational cost of updating large foundation models. If successful, this approach could provide a much more scalable and efficient method for continual learning compared to retraining or simple fine-tuning, making the deployment of adaptable, lifelong learning FMs more practical. Enabling FMs to learn continually without prohibitive costs would be a major advancement for AI applications dealing with dynamic data streams."
