        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Scalable Continual Learning for Lifelong Foundation Models'. Specifically, it tackles key topics mentioned in the call: avoiding retraining large FMs (via incremental updates), addressing catastrophic forgetting, handling domain shifts and long-tailed distributions (using meta-learning), and combining FMs with structured knowledge sources (knowledge graphs). The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's premise regarding the limitations of static FMs and the need for efficient CL at scale."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is partially clear but has some ambiguities requiring elaboration. The motivation, overall goal (scalable CL using KGs), and expected outcomes are well-stated. However, the core mechanism lacks detail. Specifically, how 'FM knowledge' is represented as KG embeddings is vague â€“ does this involve parameters, activations, extracted concepts? Furthermore, the process of using GCN updates on KG embeddings to *actually update the FM itself* is not explained. This link between the KG embedding space and the FM's operational state needs significant clarification for a complete understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While CL, KGs, GCNs, and meta-learning are established concepts, their proposed integration for scalable continual learning specifically targeting large foundation models offers a fresh perspective. Using GCNs for incremental updates on KG embeddings that represent FM knowledge appears relatively novel compared to standard KG update methods or typical CL approaches applied directly to FM parameters. The combination addresses the specific challenges of scale and knowledge retention in FMs in a distinct way."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is satisfactory but presents potential challenges. Representing the vast knowledge within a large FM as a manageable yet comprehensive KG is non-trivial. The scalability of constructing and updating these KGs, even incrementally with GCNs, could still be computationally demanding, especially if tightly coupled with FM states. The mechanism for translating updates in the KG embedding space back into meaningful updates for the FM's parameters or behavior is complex and requires careful design and validation. Access to appropriate large-scale FMs and dynamic datasets for experimentation is also a prerequisite."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the limitations of static training for large FMs through scalable continual learning is a critical challenge in modern ML. Successfully developing a method that reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves update efficiency, and allows FMs to adapt to new knowledge and data streams without constant retraining would represent a major advancement. The potential impact on the deployment and maintenance of FMs in real-world, dynamic environments is substantial."
