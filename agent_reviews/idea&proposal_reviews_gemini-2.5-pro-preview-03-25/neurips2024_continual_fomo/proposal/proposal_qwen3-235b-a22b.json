        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the workshop call (scalable CL for FMs, catastrophic forgetting, efficiency, domain shifts, long-tailed data, structured knowledge integration). The methodology clearly elaborates on the research idea of using dynamic KG-infused adapters. It positions itself well within the context of the provided literature, citing relevant works (implicitly or explicitly like Incremental LoRA, I2I) and aiming to tackle the identified key challenges (forgetting, scalability, knowledge integration)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. Objectives, methodology (including technical components like cross-attention, KG dynamics, retrieval, consolidation), training protocol, and experimental design are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The use of equations and references to figures (though not visible) aids clarity. Some minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specifics of triplet extraction ('domain-specific ontology') and the exact implementation details of graph consolidation, but the overall framework and rationale are well-defined."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While adapters, KGs, and CL are existing concepts, the specific combination of *dynamic* KGs (incrementally growing and pruned) integrated via *cross-attention* within *adapter modules* specifically for the purpose of *scalable continual learning* appears novel. It differs from K-Adapter (static knowledge, not CL focused), Incremental LoRA (focuses on KG embedding updates, not adapter integration for broader CL tasks), I2I (adapter initialization, no KG), and Linked Adapters (adapter-adapter attention). The synergy of these components to simultaneously address forgetting, efficiency, and robustness in CL is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established techniques like transformer adapters, knowledge graphs, cross-attention, and CL evaluation protocols. The methodology is technically plausible, leveraging recent work like incremental LoRA for KG updates. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant datasets (CLiMB, DomainShift-GLUE, TailMeier), strong baselines, appropriate metrics (Accuracy, BWT, Efficiency, Robustness), and planned ablation studies. The theoretical motivation is solid. Minor areas like the robustness of heuristic-based graph consolidation and the specifics of triplet extraction could require further justification, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing ML technologies and libraries. Implementing adapters and cross-attention is standard. However, managing a *dynamic* KG at scale (incremental updates, efficient sparse retrieval, effective consolidation) presents significant engineering challenges. The reliance on potentially complex 'domain-specific ontology' for triplet extraction could also be a bottleneck depending on the task domain. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation requires careful engineering and tuning, making it moderately challenging but achievable within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations of current foundation models in dynamic environments – catastrophic forgetting, update costs, and robustness to data shifts/imbalances – which are central themes of the workshop task. Successfully developing such a framework would be a major advancement for scalable CL, enabling more practical lifelong learning systems. The potential impact spans theoretical understanding (KG+CL interplay) and practical applications (cost-effective FM adaptation), making the research highly relevant and important."
