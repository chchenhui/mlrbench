    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of scalable CL for FMs, catastrophic forgetting, domain shifts, long-tailed distributions, and leveraging structured knowledge (KGs). It elaborates precisely on the research idea of dynamic KG-infused adapters. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself against the cited literature (K-Adapter, Incremental LoRA KG, Linked Adapters) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified (forgetting, efficiency, scalability, KG integration, evaluation)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the system architecture, KG handling, adapter design, retrieval mechanism, and learning objective with relevant mathematical formulations. The experimental design is well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact implementation details of multimodal KG extraction or the precise tuning strategy for KG maintenance thresholds (tau_merge, delta_prune), but the overall approach is understandable and logically structured."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While adapters, KGs, and CL are established concepts, the specific combination of (1) dynamically evolving KGs integrated via (2) cross-attention within adapter layers, coupled with (3) sparse subgraph retrieval and (4) periodic KG consolidation for the purpose of scalable *continual learning* in *foundation models* appears novel. It distinguishes itself from static KG infusion (K-Adapter), KG embedding updates alone (Incremental LoRA KG), or adapter linking without KGs (Linked Adapters), offering a fresh approach to leveraging structured knowledge dynamically during lifelong learning."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established techniques like adapters, KG embeddings (TransE/ComplEx), cross-attention, and standard CL regularization/distillation methods. The methodology is logically structured, and the technical formulations are presented correctly. However, the effectiveness of the dynamic KG maintenance heuristics (node merging, edge pruning) and the sparse retrieval mechanism needs empirical validation. The complex interplay between continuous KG updates, adapter learning, and the relevance of retrieved subgraphs introduces dependencies that require careful tuning and validation, slightly reducing the score from excellent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible as the individual components (NER/RE tools, KG embedding libraries, adapter frameworks, attention mechanisms, ANN libraries) exist. However, integrating these into a robust, scalable system presents significant engineering challenges. Managing a dynamic KG, ensuring efficient sparse retrieval at scale, and tuning the various hyperparameters (adapter rank, KG thresholds, loss weights) will require considerable effort and computational resources. While plausible, the complexity and resource requirements make it a challenging but achievable project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses critical limitations of current FMs – their static nature, catastrophic forgetting, and high update costs – which are central challenges in the field and align perfectly with the workshop's theme. By proposing a method for scalable, lifelong learning that integrates structured knowledge, it has the potential to lead to major advancements in creating more adaptable, efficient, and knowledgeable AI systems. Successful execution could provide a valuable framework for real-world applications requiring continuous updates."
