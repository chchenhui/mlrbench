    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (workshop themes on scalable CL for FMs, forgetting, domain shifts, structured knowledge), the research idea (dynamic KG-infused adapters, sparse retrieval, consolidation), and the literature review (building upon K-Adapter, Linked Adapters, I2I, continual KG embedding). It explicitly addresses the limitations of static FMs, the need for scalable CL, the challenge of catastrophic forgetting on smaller datasets, domain shifts, and the potential of integrating structured knowledge (KGs), all central points in the task description. The methodology directly implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea and positions itself relative to the cited literature."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, the overall framework is logically presented, and the methodology section breaks down complex components (KG updates, adapter architecture, retrieval, consolidation, algorithm, experiments) into understandable parts. Key concepts like DKG-Adapter, cross-attention integration, and sparse retrieval are explained well. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While leveraging existing concepts like adapters, KGs, and CL principles, the core novelty lies in their specific synergistic combination: integrating *dynamically* updated KGs into adapter modules via cross-attention specifically for the purpose of *scalable continual learning* in FMs. This differs clearly from prior work like K-Adapter (static KG), Linked Adapters/I2I (inter-adapter transfer), and continual KG embedding methods (focus on KG updates, not FM integration for CL tasks). The dynamic nature of the KG and its tight integration during the CL process is a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (FMs, adapters, KGs, attention mechanisms, CL) and established methods (NER/RE, KG embeddings, standard CL evaluation protocols). The proposed methodology, including the KG-adapter interaction via cross-attention, sparse retrieval strategy, and consolidation plan, is technically plausible and well-justified. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics. Minor weaknesses exist in the inherent complexity of integrating multiple dynamic systems, where the effectiveness of components like sparse retrieval and KG consolidation will depend heavily on careful implementation and tuning, but the overall approach is robustly conceived."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the individual components (adapters, KGs, attention) exist, integrating them into a smoothly functioning dynamic system (DKG-Adapter with incremental updates, efficient retrieval, and consolidation) requires considerable engineering effort and expertise. Tuning the interactions between the KG retrieval, cross-attention modulation, and adapter updates could be complex and time-consuming. Access to FMs and compute resources is standard, but the complexity of the proposed system introduces non-trivial risks regarding successful implementation and achieving desired efficiency within a typical project timeframe."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical and timely challenges in AI: enabling foundation models to learn continually and adapt to new information efficiently without catastrophic forgetting or costly retraining. This directly tackles the core themes of the workshop and has the potential to make FMs truly lifelong learning systems. Success would represent a major advancement in scalable CL, promote more sustainable AI practices by reducing compute waste, and offer a novel approach to integrating structured and implicit knowledge, potentially leading to more robust and grounded AI applications."
