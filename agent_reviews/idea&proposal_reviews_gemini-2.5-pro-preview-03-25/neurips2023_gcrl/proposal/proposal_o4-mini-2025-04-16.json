    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on improving GCRL algorithms, connecting GCRL with self-supervised/representation learning, and targeting relevant application domains (robotics, molecular discovery). The methodology clearly elaborates on the research idea, incorporating techniques like contrastive learning and hierarchical attention mentioned in the idea and literature. It explicitly references recent relevant papers (Patil et al., 2024; White et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023; Bortkiewicz et al., 2024) and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review (sparse rewards, sample efficiency, representation quality)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology is detailed, outlining the architecture (hierarchical attention encoder), loss functions (contrastive loss with context-aware weighting, SAC losses with equations), algorithms (integration with SAC, dynamic relabeling), data handling, and a comprehensive experimental plan (benchmarks, baselines, metrics, ablations, hyperparameters). The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the proposed research immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several recent advancements. While components like self-supervised goal representations (Doe et al., 2023), contrastive abstraction (Patil et al., 2024), hierarchical attention (White et al., 2023), and context-aware contrastive loss (Black et al., 2023) exist, the novelty lies in their specific integration: using a hierarchical attention encoder for both states and goals, applying the context-aware loss to capture long-horizon dependencies in GCRL, integrating these representations directly into SAC actor/critic/value functions, and using representation distance for relabeling. The planned theoretical analysis of the context-aware loss also adds a novel dimension. It's a strong combination of existing ideas rather than a completely new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in GCRL (SAC, HER-style relabeling), self-supervised learning (contrastive methods), and deep learning (attention). The proposed methodology, including the contrastive learning setup, context-aware weighting, integration strategy with SAC, and dynamic relabeling, is technically well-founded. The experimental design is rigorous, featuring standard benchmarks, strong recent baselines, relevant metrics, and necessary ablations. Technical formulations (equations) are provided and appear correct. Minor points like the lack of detail on the theoretical analysis prevent a higher score, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible. It relies on standard RL techniques (SAC), deep learning components (attention, contrastive loss), and available benchmarks (Meta-World). The required resources (GPU compute, standard software libraries) are typical for current ML research. Data collection follows standard procedures. While implementing and tuning the combined system (especially the contrastive module and its integration) will be challenging, it doesn't require breakthroughs in technology. The estimated run times are plausible. Potential risks involve hyperparameter tuning sensitivity and ensuring stable joint training, but these are manageable research challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses critical bottlenecks in GCRL: sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings and generalization to novel goals. These limitations currently hinder broader real-world application. By proposing a method to learn better goal-state representations via self-supervision, the research has the potential to substantially improve GCRL performance. Success would lead to more practical algorithms for domains like robotics and molecular design where reward engineering is difficult. The focus on interpretable representations and bridging GCRL with representation learning aligns with important research trends identified in the task description."
