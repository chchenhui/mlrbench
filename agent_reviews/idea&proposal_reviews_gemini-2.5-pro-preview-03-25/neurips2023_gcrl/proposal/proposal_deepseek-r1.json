    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on GCRL algorithms, their connections to self-supervised learning (SSL) and representation learning, limitations of existing methods (sparse rewards, sample efficiency), and applications in robotics and molecular design. The methodology clearly implements the core research idea (two-stage SSL+GCRL, hierarchical contrastive learning). It effectively synthesizes concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review (e.g., using contrastive learning like Bortkiewicz et al. 2024, hierarchical structures like White et al. 2023, context-aware loss ideas like Black et al. 2023)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, two-stage methodology, and experimental plan are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. Key components like the hierarchical attention encoder and contrastive loss are described with equations. However, minor ambiguities exist: the precise mechanism differentiating the 'context-aware' contrastive loss from standard contrastive loss plus temporal consistency could be slightly more explicit, and the exact way SSL embeddings are integrated into the SAC Q-function and value function could be specified. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several recent advancements in a unique way. While components like contrastive learning for GCRL (Doe et al. 2023, Bortkiewicz et al. 2024), hierarchical attention (White et al. 2023), and context-aware losses (Black et al. 2023) exist, the specific combination—using hierarchical attention (temporal and relational) within a shared encoder for metric-shared goal-state representations via a context-aware contrastive loss, and integrating this with dynamic goal relabeling in GCRL—constitutes a novel approach. It's not entirely groundbreaking but offers a fresh perspective distinct from individual prior works."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (GCRL, SAC, SSL, contrastive learning, attention mechanisms). The proposed methodology (two-stage learning, specific loss functions, integration strategy) is logical and well-justified for addressing the stated problems. The technical formulations provided (loss equations) are standard and appear correct. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant benchmarks (Meta-World, Molecular Generation), strong baselines (HER, JaxGCRL, Hierarchical GCRL), appropriate metrics, and necessary ablation studies. While empirical validation is needed, the approach is technically plausible and lacks obvious flaws."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard machine learning techniques (Transformers, contrastive learning, SAC) and widely used benchmarks (Meta-World). Implementation can leverage existing libraries. The required computational resources (GPUs) are standard for this type of research. The scope is ambitious (two complex domains, multiple baselines, ablations) but manageable within a typical research project timeframe. Potential challenges include hyperparameter tuning (e.g., balancing loss terms, contrastive temperature) and ensuring stable training, but these are common research risks and do not render the proposal infeasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles critical challenges in GCRL—sparse rewards, sample efficiency, and generalization—which are major bottlenecks for practical applications. By proposing a method to learn better goal-state representations via SSL, it directly addresses a core issue highlighted in the task description and literature. Success would lead to more efficient and adaptable RL agents, potentially accelerating progress in important domains like robotics, precision medicine (molecular design), and potentially causal reasoning through interpretable representations. The work has strong potential for both theoretical contributions (understanding GCRL-SSL connections) and practical impact."
