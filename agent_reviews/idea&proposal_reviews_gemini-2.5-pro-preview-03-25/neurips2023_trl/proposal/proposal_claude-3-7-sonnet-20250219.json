    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the TRL workshop's goals by focusing on representation learning for tables, multimodal aspects (text-to-SQL), key applications (QA, text-to-SQL), and challenges (complex structures, heterogeneous schemas). It faithfully expands on the core research idea of a dual-stream structure-aware model. Furthermore, it effectively positions itself within the provided literature, acknowledging prior work (TAPAS, TaBERT, TableFormer, etc.) and explicitly aiming to address the identified challenge of integrating structural semantics more deeply than existing content-centric approaches."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very clear and well-structured. The introduction effectively motivates the problem and states the objectives. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the dual-stream architecture (content and structure streams with GAT), cross-stream interaction, and pretraining objectives, including mathematical formulations. The experimental design, datasets, metrics, and ablation plans are clearly outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for extracting the schema graph from diverse sources or the exact modeling details for the SQL-Schema Alignment loss, but overall, the proposal is highly understandable and logically presented."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality. While building upon existing transformer and GAT techniques, the core idea of a dedicated dual-stream architecture explicitly separating content processing (Transformer) from structural metadata processing (GAT on schema graph) with cross-stream interaction is innovative in the context of table representation learning. Compared to prior work like TAPAS/TaBERT (content-focused) or TableFormer (implicit structure via attention bias), this approach treats structure as a first-class citizen. The combination of pretraining objectives, particularly Schema Relation Prediction on the graph and cross-stream alignment tasks (CSA, SSA), further contributes to the novelty. It represents a fresh perspective distinct from the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It leverages well-established architectures (Transformers, GATs) appropriate for the respective data types (sequence, graph). The motivation for the dual-stream approach is well-grounded in the limitations of previous models. The proposed pretraining objectives (MCR, SRP, CSA, SSA) are relevant and logically designed to foster both content and structural understanding. The mathematical formulations are generally clear and correct. The experimental plan is comprehensive, including standard benchmarks, relevant baselines, appropriate metrics, and well-designed ablation studies. Potential challenges like schema extraction consistency are acknowledged implicitly through the description of preprocessing."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The primary challenge lies in curating a large-scale, diverse dataset with accurate and consistent structural metadata (schema graphs including hierarchies, key relationships) from varied and often messy sources (web tables, spreadsheets, DB dumps). This data collection and preprocessing step is non-trivial and resource-intensive. Additionally, training a complex dual-stream model with multiple loss terms for 500k steps on 8 GPUs requires substantial computational resources and time. While technically possible with standard ML tools, the practical hurdles related to data and computation lower the feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: enabling deep understanding of structured tabular data, which is ubiquitous but often poorly handled by standard models. Improving performance on tasks requiring structural reasoning (like text-to-SQL, complex QA, schema matching) and enhancing robustness to diverse table structures would be major advancements. Success could significantly impact applications in data analysis, natural language interfaces to databases, data integration, and multimodal AI. The expected outcomes (SOTA performance, robustness, generalization) are substantial and align perfectly with the goals of advancing table representation learning."
