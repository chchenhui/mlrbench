        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core goals of the TRL workshop, focusing on representation learning for tables, enhancing LLMs for structured data, tackling challenges like complex structures and heterogeneous schemas, and aiming for impactful applications like text-to-SQL and QA. The methodology precisely follows the research idea's dual-stream concept and pretraining tasks. Furthermore, it positions itself effectively against the cited literature, acknowledging existing work (like TAPAS, TaBERT, TableFormer) while proposing a distinct approach to address identified key challenges (explicit structural modeling)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, dual-stream architecture concept, pretraining tasks, and evaluation plan are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The inclusion of high-level mathematical formulas aids comprehension. However, some minor ambiguities exist; for instance, the exact mechanism for constructing the 'learnable schema graph' and the specifics of the 'structural position embeddings' could be elaborated further for perfect clarity. Despite these minor points, the overall research plan is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using transformers and GCNs is common, the specific architectural design – an explicit dual-stream approach separating content and structure processing with a dedicated GCN-based structure stream and cross-stream alignment – offers a fresh perspective in the context of tabular language models. Compared to prior work cited (e.g., TableFormer's biased attention, TaBERT's content-focused pretraining with schema awareness), this explicit separation and the combination of pretraining tasks (especially schema relation prediction and SQL-schema alignment) represent a novel contribution to TRL. It's not entirely groundbreaking in the broader ML context but is innovative for this specific problem domain."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (transformers for sequences, GCNs for graphs, attention mechanisms) and established pretraining paradigms. The motivation is well-grounded in the limitations of existing models. The proposed methodology, including the dual-stream architecture and the choice of pretraining tasks (Masked Cell Recovery, Schema Relation Prediction, Cross-Stream Alignment), is logical and directly targets the research objectives. The experimental design uses standard benchmarks, metrics, and baselines, ensuring methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations, while high-level, appear correct. Minor uncertainties might exist regarding the optimal way to construct and learn the schema graph, but the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The required technologies (Transformers, GCNs) and frameworks are readily available. Standard datasets are proposed. However, pretraining such a dual-stream model will likely require significant computational resources. Implementing and effectively tuning the interaction between the two streams, particularly the cross-stream attention mechanism and the learnable schema graph, might involve considerable engineering effort and experimentation. Success also depends on the availability and quality of schema information in the datasets used for the structure stream. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable within a well-resourced research environment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and acknowledged limitation of current LLMs and TRL models: understanding complex table structures and heterogeneous schemas. Improving performance on tasks like text-to-SQL and table QA has substantial practical value in data analysis and interaction. Success would represent a significant advancement in TRL, potentially leading to more robust and versatile models for real-world tabular data. The research aligns perfectly with the goals of advancing TRL and fostering cross-community collaboration (NLP, ML, DB), as outlined in the task description."
