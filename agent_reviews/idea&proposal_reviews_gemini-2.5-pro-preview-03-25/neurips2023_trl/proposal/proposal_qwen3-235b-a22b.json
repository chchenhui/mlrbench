    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the TRL workshop's focus on representation learning for tables, LLMs for structured data, and applications like text-to-SQL and QA. It faithfully implements the core concepts of the research idea (dual-stream, structure-awareness, cross-alignment). Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself against the limitations of prior work identified in the literature review (TURL, TableFormer, TaBERT, etc.) and aims to tackle key challenges like handling complex structures and heterogeneous schemas."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated, and the motivation is well-articulated. The methodology section provides substantial detail on data collection, model architecture (including mathematical formulations for embeddings, GAT, and cross-attention), pretraining tasks (with loss functions), and experimental design. The structure is logical and easy to follow. While highly detailed, minor ambiguities might exist in the exact implementation details of schema graph construction from diverse sources, but overall clarity is excellent."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While components like Transformers, GATs, and pretraining objectives (like masked prediction) exist, the core novelty lies in the specific architecture: a *dual-stream* approach explicitly separating content and structure processing for tables, using a GAT for encoding hierarchical schema graphs, and introducing dedicated cross-stream alignment pretraining tasks. This explicit separation and structured modeling approach distinguishes it significantly from prior single-stream or implicitly structure-aware models mentioned in the literature (e.g., TableFormer, TaBERT), offering a fresh perspective on tabular representation learning."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in the limitations of existing models identified in the literature. The choice of architecture (Transformer for content, GAT for structure) is well-justified for the respective data types. The proposed pretraining tasks (MCR, SRP, CSA) are relevant and technically sound variations of established self-supervised learning paradigms. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, standard benchmarks, ablation studies, and appropriate metrics. Technical formulations are correct and clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Aggregating and preprocessing 18 million tables, especially extracting consistent and accurate schema metadata (hierarchies, keys), is ambitious and potentially resource-intensive. Training a large dual-stream model requires significant computational resources (GPU clusters), typical for foundation model pretraining but still a hurdle. The complexity of tuning the interaction between the two streams and the loss weights adds another layer of difficulty. However, the components are based on existing technologies, the model size is comparable to existing models (BERT-base), and the evaluation plan uses standard benchmarks, making it generally achievable with adequate resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and well-recognized limitation of current LLMs â€“ their inability to robustly handle complex table structures, which hinders their use in many real-world, data-intensive applications (especially enterprise settings). Successfully developing a model that explicitly leverages schema structure could lead to major advancements in tasks like text-to-SQL, table QA, and data integration. The potential impact on industry (democratizing data access) and research (establishing schema-awareness as a key principle) is substantial. The planned open-source release further enhances its significance."
