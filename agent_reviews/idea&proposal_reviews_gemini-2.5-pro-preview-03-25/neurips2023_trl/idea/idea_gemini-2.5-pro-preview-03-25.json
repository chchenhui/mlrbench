    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description (TRL Workshop Call for Papers). It directly addresses 'Representation Learning for (semi-)Structured Data', 'Multimodal Learning' by combining tables and text, proposes 'new model architectures' (structure-aware encoders) and 'pre-training techniques' (novel objectives), and targets key 'Applications' like 'text-to-SQL' and 'question answering'. The focus on improving table understanding by integrating schema and text aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals, especially the NLP focus mentioned for the ACL edition."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, main proposal (multimodal pre-training with structure-awareness), specific components (encoders), novel objectives (Schema-Text Alignment, Cell-Text Grounding, Table-Text Matching), and expected outcomes are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact nature of the 'specialized transformers' or specific GNN architectures envisioned, but the overall concept and methodology are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While multimodal table-text pre-training and structure-aware table encoding are existing concepts, the specific combination proposed here, particularly the set of three novel pre-training objectives (Schema-Text Alignment, Cell-Text Grounding, Table-Text Matching) designed to explicitly model schema, content, and text relationships simultaneously, offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond simple table flattening or standard MLM-style objectives, focusing on deeper semantic alignment across modalities and structure."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. It relies on existing components like transformer architectures, GNNs, and large-scale table-text corpora (which are available). The proposed pre-training objectives, while novel, appear implementable with appropriate data processing. The main challenge lies in the computational resources required for large-scale pre-training, which is standard for this type of research but still a significant undertaking. No fundamental technological barriers seem to prevent implementation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Effectively fusing table structure, content, and related text is a key challenge in table understanding. Success in this area could lead to substantial improvements in important downstream tasks like text-conditional table QA, text-to-SQL generation, and table summarization, which are core applications highlighted by the workshop. Advancing schema-aware multimodal representation learning would be a valuable contribution to the NLP and ML communities working with structured data."
