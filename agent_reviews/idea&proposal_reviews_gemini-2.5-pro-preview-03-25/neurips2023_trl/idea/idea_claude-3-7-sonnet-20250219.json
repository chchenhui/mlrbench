    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The TabAlign idea is highly consistent with the workshop's scope. It directly addresses 'Representation Learning for (semi-)Structured Data' (specifically tables), proposing a new model architecture (dual-encoder with attention) and pre-training technique (contrastive learning). Its focus on semantic alignment directly relates to applications like 'data integration, cataloging, retrieval (data search)', which are explicitly mentioned in the call. It tackles challenges of heterogeneity, aligning with the workshop's interest in messy data. While the workshop mentions a special focus on NLP for this edition, TabAlign's core topic (table representation learning) is central to the workshop's overall theme and relevant to many NLP+table tasks, fitting well within the broader call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (semantic table alignment challenges) is well-defined. The core technical approach (contrastive learning, dual-encoder, table-specific attention, weak supervision) is clearly articulated. The intended outcome (robust table embeddings) and evaluation strategy (retrieval, discovery, matching) are specified. The description is concise, unambiguous, and easy to understand, providing a strong foundation for the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While contrastive learning and dual-encoder architectures are established techniques, their specific application to learning representations for *entire tables* focused on *semantic alignment* across diverse schemas is less explored than, for example, column-based or task-specific table embeddings (like for QA). The proposed 'table-specific attention mechanisms' focusing on structure, headers, and data distributions, rather than just text, adds a layer of innovation. It combines existing concepts in a novel way to address a specific challenge in table understanding. It's not a completely new paradigm but offers a fresh and potentially effective approach within the table representation learning space."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Contrastive learning frameworks, attention mechanisms, and dual-encoder models are well-understood and implementable using standard deep learning libraries. The main technical challenges would involve efficiently encoding entire tables (potentially large ones) and designing effective table-specific attention. Generating or identifying sufficient high-quality positive and negative table pairs for contrastive training is crucial; the proposed use of weak supervision is a practical strategy to mitigate this, though its effectiveness will need validation. Access to diverse table corpora for training/evaluation is necessary but generally achievable. Overall, the approach relies on existing, mature techniques, making implementation practical, albeit with potential engineering hurdles related to scale and data sourcing."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Semantic table alignment is a fundamental and challenging problem in data integration, data discovery, and knowledge management. A robust solution like TabAlign could greatly improve efficiency in data cataloging, search, and schema matching, particularly in environments with numerous heterogeneous tables (e.g., data lakes). Success would represent a meaningful contribution to the ML, DB, and IR communities, directly aligning with the workshop's goals of advancing the field and showcasing impactful applications. The ability to capture semantic relationships beyond simple textual or structural similarity could unlock significant value."
