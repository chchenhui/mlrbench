        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (TRL Workshop). It directly addresses 'Representation Learning for (semi-)Structured Data' by proposing a new pre-training technique and model architecture (tri-view multi-encoder). It incorporates 'Multimodal Learning' by combining text, graph, and code (SQL) views of tables. Furthermore, it targets key 'Applications of TRL models' like QA, text-to-SQL, and classification, aiming for improved cross-format transfer, which is a central challenge highlighted in the workshop scope. The focus on pretraining for unified embeddings on diverse table sources fits squarely within the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (lack of generalization in current models) is explicitly stated. The core proposal (tri-view contrastive pretraining) is clearly articulated, specifying the three views (Text, Graph, SQL) and the models associated with each (Transformer, GNN, Seq2Seq). The pretraining objectives (contrastive alignment, masked cell modeling) are also clearly mentioned. The expected outcomes are well-described. While specific architectural details are omitted (as expected for a summary), the overall concept and methodology are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like using transformers for text views (e.g., TAPAS), GNNs for graph views (e.g., TURL), and contrastive learning exist in table representation, the proposed *tri-view* approach combining Text, Graph, and a synthetic SQL view within a unified contrastive framework is innovative. Specifically, using synthetic SQL queries as a distinct modality for contrastive alignment alongside text and graph representations of the *same* table offers a fresh perspective for capturing relational structure and queryability directly during pretraining. This combination represents a significant step beyond existing dual-view or single-view models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant engineering and computational challenges. Implementing the individual encoders (Transformer, GNN, Seq2Seq) is standard. However, collecting and processing 'millions of diverse web tables and relational DBs' requires substantial data engineering effort, though potentially leveraging existing large corpora. The main challenge lies in the computational cost of pretraining three separate encoders simultaneously with contrastive objectives on such a large dataset, requiring considerable GPU/TPU resources. Generating diverse and meaningful synthetic SQL queries for the SQL view also requires careful design and implementation. While technically achievable with current technology, the resource requirements are high."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and acknowledged problem in table representation learning: the lack of robust generalization across diverse table formats and downstream tasks. Creating a unified embedding space that captures semantics from text, graph, and SQL perspectives could lead to major advancements in cross-domain and cross-task transfer learning for tables. Success would likely reduce the dependency on large labeled datasets for specific tasks (e.g., text-to-SQL, table QA) and foster more adaptable and powerful table understanding systems, directly contributing to the core goals of the TRL field."
