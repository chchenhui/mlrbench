        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (TRL Workshop Call for Papers). It directly addresses the 'Multimodal Learning' topic by proposing to combine structured data (tables) with other modalities (text, images). It also relates to 'Representation Learning for (semi-)Structured Data' by aiming to enhance table representations and 'Applications of TRL models' by targeting tasks like data preparation, analysis, and generation. The use of pre-trained models fits the workshop's interest in pre-training paradigms and LLMs/large models. The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of advancing table representation learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main concept (using multi-modal transformers like CLIP for contextual table embeddings), and methodology steps (preprocessing, embedding, fine-tuning, evaluation) are well-defined. Mentioning specific model types (CLIP) adds concreteness. Expected outcomes and impact are also clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact preprocessing technique for converting diverse tabular structures into a format suitable for models like CLIP and the specific benchmarks for evaluation, but the overall research direction is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While multimodal learning for tables exists (e.g., text+table), specifically leveraging large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP to embed tabular data using associated text *and potentially images* as context is a relatively fresh approach. Most prior work focuses on text associated directly with table content or structure, rather than potentially external multimodal context. Fine-tuning such models for a range of downstream tabular tasks (prep, analysis, generation) further contributes to the novelty. It represents a new combination and application of existing powerful techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Pre-trained models like CLIP are accessible, and standard deep learning frameworks can be used. The main challenges lie in: 1) Data Sourcing: Finding or creating datasets where tables are meaningfully linked with relevant images might be difficult for general cases, although text descriptions are more common. 2) Preprocessing: Designing an effective method to represent tabular structure and content alongside text/image features for input into a model like CLIP requires careful engineering. 3) Resources: Fine-tuning large multi-modal models demands substantial computational resources (GPUs, memory). However, these are engineering challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks, making the idea feasible with adequate resources and effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Improving tabular data representation is a fundamental problem due to the ubiquity of tables. Incorporating richer context from text and images could lead to more nuanced and powerful representations, potentially boosting performance significantly on various downstream tasks, especially where such multimodal context is naturally available (e.g., product catalogs, scientific data, web tables). Enhanced interpretability is also a valuable potential outcome. Success could provide a strong new method for table understanding and analysis, impacting fields relying heavily on structured data."
