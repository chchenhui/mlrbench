    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the workshop's core themes. It directly addresses 'Multimodal Learning' by combining tables and text, proposes a novel 'Representation Learning' architecture (heterogeneous GNN + Transformer + attention), targets relevant 'Applications' (table QA, fact-checking, retrieval, analysis), and fits the workshop's specific focus on NLP progress by aiming to improve table-text understanding. It also touches upon pre-training techniques and handling heterogeneous table structures, aligning well with multiple listed topics."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of current methods), the core technical components (heterogeneous GNN for tables, Transformer for text, cross-modal attention, contrastive learning), the training methodology (pre-training/fine-tuning), target benchmarks, and expected impact. The proposal is concise and immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity regarding the main concepts."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While combining GNNs and Transformers for table-text tasks isn't entirely new, the specific emphasis on using *heterogeneous* GNNs to explicitly model diverse structural elements (row-column hierarchies, foreign keys, metadata) and aligning table *subgraphs* with textual phrases via contrastive learning offers a fresh perspective. It represents a thoughtful refinement and combination of existing techniques rather than a completely groundbreaking concept, providing solid incremental innovation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core technologies (GNNs, Transformers, attention, contrastive learning) are mature with available libraries and frameworks. Suitable large-scale datasets (e.g., Wikipedia table-text pairs) exist for pre-training, and standard evaluation benchmarks are available. Designing and implementing the heterogeneous GNN and integrating the full framework requires significant engineering effort and computational resources, particularly for pre-training, but it relies on established methods and is well within the capabilities of current ML research labs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Effectively aligning structured tables and unstructured text is a critical challenge in AI with broad applications in question answering, fact verification, data analysis, and enterprise search. Addressing the limitations of existing methods by better capturing table structure could lead to substantial improvements on complex reasoning tasks and enable more powerful data interaction tools. Success would be a meaningful contribution to the TRL field and multimodal AI."
