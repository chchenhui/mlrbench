        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (SoLaR workshop themes like transparency, explainability, low-resource languages, bias, equity), the research idea (interpretable LMs for low-resource languages via adapted methods and community co-design), and the literature review (building on InkubaLM/Glot500, addressing challenges like morphology, code-switching, community engagement identified in cited works). It systematically incorporates elements from all three inputs, ensuring the research directly addresses the stated goals and context. Objectives, methods, and expected outcomes are logically derived and consistent throughout."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. Objectives are distinct, the methodology is broken down into logical phases (adaptive techniques, community design, evaluation), and the experimental setup and expected outcomes are specified. The structure is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise implementation details of the adapted SHAP/LIME methods (e.g., specifics of morpheme integration, code-switch span swapping mechanism) and the exact process for translating cultural norms into interface elements, but these are acceptable at the proposal stage."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing XAI techniques (SHAP, LIME) and concepts from the literature (community engagement, morphological adaptation), it innovatively synthesizes these elements into a cohesive framework specifically for low-resource LMs. The proposed 'Morphology-Aware SHAP' and 'Code-Switching LIME' represent novel technical adaptations tailored to specific linguistic challenges. The integration of these technical methods with culturally grounded, community-co-designed interfaces and a dual-focus evaluation framework (technical robustness + user trust) constitutes a fresh and valuable contribution distinct from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established XAI principles and relevant literature on low-resource NLP. The methodology, including adapting SHAP/LIME, employing participatory design, and using a mix of technical (KL divergence for consistency) and user-centric (task success, surveys) evaluations, is robust. The mathematical formulation for SHAP is standard, and its adaptation to morphemes is conceptually sound, as is the consistency metric. Potential minor weaknesses lie in the assumptions regarding the ease of obtaining high-quality morphological/code-switching annotations and the direct translatability of cultural metaphors into effective UI elements, but the overall approach is well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. It leverages existing resources (InkubaLM, Glot500). However, adapting XAI methods requires significant technical expertise. The community engagement aspect (participatory workshops in 3 diverse regions, co-design, user studies) is logistically complex and requires careful planning, resources, and cultural sensitivity. Obtaining necessary linguistic annotations (morphology, code-switching) for 10 languages might be challenging. While achievable with adequate funding and a skilled team, the scope presents moderate implementation risks, particularly around cross-cultural collaboration and annotation quality."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical intersection of LM transparency, equity, and low-resource languages â€“ a key area highlighted by the SoLaR workshop. By aiming to make LMs more understandable and accountable for marginalized communities, it has the potential to mitigate bias, foster trust, and promote more inclusive AI deployment. The expected outcomes (open-source tools, culturally adapted interfaces, evaluation frameworks, guidelines) could have substantial positive effects on socially responsible NLP research and practice, empowering underserved language communities."
