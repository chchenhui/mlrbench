    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description (SoLaR workshop themes like transparency, equity, accountability, LRLs, interpretability), the research idea (developing interpretable LRL LMs via adapted methods and community co-design), and the literature review (citing and building upon relevant work like InkubaLM, Glot500, and specific papers on XAI for LRLs, morphology, code-switching, evaluation, and community engagement). It comprehensively addresses the requirements and demonstrates a deep understanding of the context and prior work, with no inconsistencies."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-defined, and immediately understandable. The objectives (Adapt, Co-design, Evaluate, Produce) are explicitly stated. The methodology is detailed with distinct phases, specific techniques (LIME/SHAP adaptations, co-design workshops), and evaluation metrics (technical and user-centric). The rationale is well-articulated, and the structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities, such as the final selection of LRLs or the exact unsupervised morphology method if needed, are acceptable at the proposal stage."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation, although it doesn't propose entirely groundbreaking XAI methods. Its novelty lies in the specific, integrated approach: 1) Adapting established methods (LIME/SHAP) explicitly for both morphological complexity and code-switching within the LRL context, building on recent but distinct works [8, 9]. 2) Systematically combining these technical adaptations with a structured community co-design process for explanation interfaces [6]. 3) Proposing a comprehensive evaluation framework integrating technical fidelity/robustness with user-centric metrics (trust, usability) tailored to LRLs [7]. While individual components draw from existing ideas [5], their synthesis into a practical, evaluated framework and toolkit for LRLs represents a fresh contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is based on solid theoretical foundations (established XAI methods like LIME/SHAP, linguistic concepts) and leverages relevant prior work (LRL models [1, 2], specific XAI adaptations [8, 9], evaluation methods [7]). The proposed methodology (adaptation strategies for morphology/code-switching, participatory co-design, mixed-methods evaluation) is robust, well-justified, and detailed. Technical concepts, including the conceptual SHAP formulation, are presented correctly. The reliance on existing literature strengthens its foundation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. It leverages available LRL models [1, 2] and standard XAI libraries. The technical adaptations are challenging but achievable. The phased plan is realistic. Key dependencies include: 1) Availability of adequate morphological analysis tools or development of effective unsupervised methods for chosen LRLs. 2) Successful recruitment and engagement with LRL speaker communities, requiring careful planning and resources. 3) Access to sufficient computational resources. While ambitious, the project seems implementable within a typical research context with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and under-explored problem of interpretability for LMs in low-resource languages, directly tackling issues of transparency, equity, and accountability for marginalized communities. Success would lead to major advancements in socially responsible AI by providing methods and tools to audit LRL models, foster trust, empower communities, and reduce bias risks. The alignment with the SoLaR workshop's goals is excellent, and the potential contributions to both XAI research and practical, ethical AI deployment are substantial."
