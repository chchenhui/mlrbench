        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (SoLaR workshop themes like transparency, interpretability, equity, bias, low-resource languages), the research idea (developing an interpretability framework for low-resource LMs via technical adaptation and community co-design), and the literature review (building upon works like InkubaLM, Glot500, and specific papers on XAI challenges, community methods, morphology, and code-switching in low-resource contexts). It directly addresses the workshop's call for socially responsible LM research by focusing on interpretability and equity for underserved languages, integrating insights and challenges identified in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicit, the methodology is logically structured into phases, and the expected outcomes are well-defined. Technical concepts like morpheme-aware SHAP and code-switching attention are introduced, along with evaluation plans. However, some technical details (e.g., the precise implementation of morpheme-aware SHAP, the nature of ground truth for the fidelity score) could benefit from further elaboration. The reference to a non-included 'Figure 1' slightly detracts from full clarity, but the textual description is sufficient for general understanding."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While applying XAI to low-resource languages isn't entirely new (Ref 5), the novelty lies in the specific technical adaptations proposed (morpheme-aware SHAP, code-switching attention tailored to linguistic features, building on Ref 8 & 9), the integrated framework combining these technical innovations with deep community co-design (Ref 6) and a dual evaluation strategy (Ref 7), and the planned open-source toolkit (Ref 10). It offers a fresh, holistic approach that synthesizes and extends existing ideas in a targeted manner for the low-resource context, moving beyond general calls for interpretability."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established XAI methods (SHAP, LIME) and relevant NLP research (InkubaLM, Glot500, linguistic features of low-resource languages). The methodology, including technical adaptations, participatory design, and a dual evaluation approach (technical robustness and user trust), is well-reasoned. The technical formulations provided (e.g., for morpheme-aware SHAP) are conceptually sound but serve more as illustrations and would require more rigorous definition and validation during research. The reliance on potentially imperfect morphology analyzers or the challenge of defining 'ground truth' for fidelity are minor points needing consideration."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technologies and methods. Technical aspects like adapting SHAP or training classifiers are achievable. Using existing corpora like Glot500 is practical. However, significant challenges exist: 1) Securing deep, ethical, and effective collaboration with 3-5 diverse native speaker communities requires substantial logistical planning, time, resources, and relationship-building effort. 2) Curating high-quality, annotated code-switched data might be difficult. 3) Availability and quality of prerequisite tools like morphology analyzers for the target languages could vary. While feasible, the community engagement aspect carries moderate risk and requires careful management."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical intersection of interpretability, equity, and low-resource languages, directly aligning with the goals of socially responsible AI and the SoLaR workshop. Success would lead to major advancements by providing methods and tools to make LMs more transparent and trustworthy for marginalized communities. This has substantial potential impact on reducing bias, empowering communities to audit/refine AI, enabling safer deployment in sensitive areas (education, health), and promoting global linguistic equity. The theoretical contributions to language-specific XAI and community-centric NLP are also notable."
