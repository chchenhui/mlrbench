        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses the 'Transparency, explainability, interpretability of LMs' topic explicitly listed in the workshop call. The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals of fostering responsible and ethical research by focusing on understanding and diagnosing LLM behavior to improve accountability, trust, and potentially mitigate harms like bias, which are central themes of SoLaR."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is very clearly articulated. The motivation is well-defined, the core methodology (combining causal mediation and counterfactual perturbations) is explained, and the steps involved (identifying key elements, generating edits, computing causal scores, delivering 'what-if' explanations) are laid out logically. The evaluation plan is also mentioned. While some technical details are high-level, the overall concept and approach are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While techniques like causal analysis, counterfactual explanations, saliency maps, and information bottleneck probes exist individually in the context of model interpretability, the proposed framework synthesizes them in a specific way for LLMs. The focus on correlating minimal counterfactual input edits with changes in intermediate activations via causal mediation analysis to generate ranked 'what-if' statements represents a novel combination and refinement of existing approaches, rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current ML techniques. Gradient computation, counterfactual generation, and causal analysis methods are available. However, applying these efficiently and robustly to large-scale LLMs presents significant computational challenges. Ensuring the 'minimality' of counterfactual edits and the validity of the causal claims derived from mediation analysis on complex, high-dimensional representations requires careful methodological design and validation. Conducting the planned user studies and robustness evaluations adds complexity but is standard. Overall, it's achievable but requires substantial research and engineering effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. LLM opacity is a major barrier to their responsible deployment. Developing methods for causal, counterfactual explanations addresses a critical need for transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness. Success in this area could lead to major advancements in understanding LLM decision-making, diagnosing biases, ensuring safety, and facilitating regulatory compliance, directly contributing to the core mission of the SoLaR workshop."
