        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea aligns perfectly with the SoLaR workshop's goals and topics. It directly addresses 'Transparency, explainability, interpretability of LMs' and 'Applications of LMs for social good, including... LMs for low-resource languages'. Furthermore, its motivation explicitly focuses on 'fairness, equity, accountability, transparency', 'bias and exclusion', and 'socially responsible AI', which are central themes of the workshop. The proposal tackles risks associated with LM deployment in vulnerable contexts (low-resource languages), fitting the workshop's emphasis on addressing harms from early development stages."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (dual challenges in low-resource LMs), the main technical approach (adapting SHAP/LIME for specific linguistic features), the collaborative methodology (co-design with native speakers), and the evaluation strategy (technical robustness and user trust). The expected outcomes (tools, guidelines) and overall goals (reduce bias, foster equity) are explicitly articulated, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While interpretability techniques (SHAP, LIME) exist, their adaptation specifically for linguistic features unique to low-resource languages (e.g., complex morphology, code-switching) is a novel technical contribution. More significantly, the integration of these technical adaptations with community-driven co-design and validation, focusing on culturally grounded explanations for low-resource contexts, represents a fresh and innovative socio-technical approach. It moves beyond purely technical interpretability towards user-centered, culturally relevant transparency."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate challenges. Adapting existing interpretability methods is technically achievable, though potentially complex depending on the language and model. The main challenge lies in the community collaboration aspect: identifying, engaging ethically, and effectively co-designing with native speakers requires significant logistical effort, cultural sensitivity, and potentially resources. Access to relevant communities and ensuring meaningful participation can be difficult. Evaluating 'user-perceived trust' and 'culturally grounded' explanations also requires careful methodological design. However, these challenges are part of the research problem itself rather than insurmountable barriers."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical intersection of interpretability, low-resource languages, and AI ethics. Enhancing transparency and trust in LMs for marginalized linguistic communities is crucial for equitable technology deployment and mitigating potential harms like bias propagation. Success would lead to practical tools and guidelines, empower communities, and advance the field of socially responsible NLP by providing a model for culturally grounded explainability. It directly contributes to making AI more inclusive and accountable."
