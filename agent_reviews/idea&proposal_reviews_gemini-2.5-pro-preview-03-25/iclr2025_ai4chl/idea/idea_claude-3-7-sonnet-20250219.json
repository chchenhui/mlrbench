        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on AI for children's healthcare, specifically pediatric early diagnosis and intervention. It highlights the potential to bridge gaps in low-resource settings, a key motivation mentioned in the task. The proposed multimodal approach fits under 'New Methods on AI for Children', and the need for diverse global datasets aligns with 'New AI Datasets and Benchmarks about Children'. The project inherently deals with the opportunities and potential risks of AI in pediatrics and child development."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (need for accessible ECI screening), the main idea (multimodal AI mobile app), the specific inputs (video, audio, questionnaires), the intended outputs (guidance, risk stratification, tracking), and key considerations (diversity, privacy, XAI) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The target population (0-5 years) and deployment context (underserved regions) are clearly stated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While AI has been explored for specific aspects of developmental assessment (e.g., motor skills via video), this proposal integrates multiple modalities (vision, audio, NLP) into a single, accessible mobile platform designed for continuous screening and global deployment. The emphasis on diverse global datasets, cultural sensitivity, explainability, and longitudinal tracking within this specific application context offers a fresh and innovative approach compared to existing point-in-time clinical tools or more narrowly focused research prototypes."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. While the core technologies (mobile development, CV, ASR, NLP) exist, acquiring large-scale, diverse, ethically sourced, and accurately labelled multimodal data (videos/audio of children 0-5 across various cultures and environments) is a major hurdle. Ensuring the system's robustness and accuracy across different devices, lighting conditions, languages, and cultural contexts is technically demanding. Addressing privacy concerns rigorously and gaining trust from parents and healthcare providers are also critical challenges. The project is feasible as a research endeavor, but scaling it reliably poses considerable difficulties."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Early detection of developmental delays is critical for improving long-term outcomes for children. Creating an accessible, low-cost screening tool could democratize access to ECI, particularly in underserved regions lacking specialist resources. This directly addresses a major global health challenge and could lead to substantial improvements in child development trajectories and reduce future healthcare costs. The potential impact on public health and equity is very high."
