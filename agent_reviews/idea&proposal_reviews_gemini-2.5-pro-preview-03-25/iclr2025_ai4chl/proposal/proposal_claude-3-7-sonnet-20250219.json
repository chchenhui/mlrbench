    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (AI for Children's Education using LLMs), the research idea (Developmentally-Appropriate LLM Tutors), and the literature review (building on KidLM, addressing challenges like data, safety, appropriateness). It directly tackles the workshop's theme by proposing a new method and system for AI in early childhood education, explicitly referencing and aiming to overcome challenges identified in the literature (e.g., data scarcity, developmental appropriateness, safety)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It has a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Outcomes/Impact) with clearly articulated objectives. The methodology is broken down into distinct, understandable phases with specific steps. Technical concepts like the fine-tuning strategies and safety mechanisms are explained, including mathematical formulations, enhancing clarity for a technical audience. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing LLM fine-tuning concepts and acknowledging related work like KidLM, it proposes a novel combination of techniques specifically for dynamic developmental adaptation in the 4-7 age range. Key novel aspects include the progressive fine-tuning strategy combined with stratified masking, the developmental parameter adaptation mechanism for interpolating model variants, and the real-time developmental adaptation module integrated within a comprehensive tutoring system. The focus on integrating Piagetian stages and specific pedagogical strategies into the LLM adaptation process adds significant novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in developmental psychology principles (Piaget) and established machine learning techniques (LLM fine-tuning, safety classifiers). The methodology is detailed and logically constructed. The inclusion of specific technical formulations for adaptation and safety mechanisms adds rigor. The multi-faceted evaluation plan further strengthens its soundness. Minor weaknesses include the inherent challenge of accurately inferring developmental level from limited interaction data and the empirical validation needed for the proposed adaptation mechanisms, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. The core technical work (fine-tuning LLMs, building classifiers, developing an interface) uses existing technologies. However, the data collection phase (5000+ books, 10000+ dialogues, expert annotation, potential classroom data) is resource-intensive and may face logistical/ethical hurdles. The comprehensive evaluation plan (60 children, expert panel, longitudinal study) also requires significant resources and coordination. While technically plausible, successful execution depends heavily on securing adequate resources, expertise across multiple domains, and navigating data acquisition challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical gap in AI development â€“ the lack of safe, effective, and developmentally appropriate tools for young children. Success would represent a major advancement in educational technology for early childhood, potentially improving learning outcomes and equity. It also contributes valuable research on child-centric AI design, developmental adaptation methods, and safety protocols, aligning perfectly with the growing need for responsible AI for vulnerable populations."
