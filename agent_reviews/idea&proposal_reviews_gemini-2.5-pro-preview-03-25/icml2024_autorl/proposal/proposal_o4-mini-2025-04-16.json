        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on AutoRL, particularly the intersection of LLMs, Meta-Learning, and AutoML for RL. The core idea matches the provided summary, aiming to use LLMs for dynamic HPO. It explicitly builds upon and cites the provided literature, positioning itself relative to existing work on dynamic HPO landscapes [1], offline HPO methods [2, 3], and LLM meta-learning capabilities [4], while addressing the key challenges identified."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the meta-MDP formulation, the two-phase training approach (supervised pre-training, meta-RL fine-tuning), and the online deployment mechanism, including mathematical formulations and algorithmic summaries. The experimental design is thorough, specifying benchmarks, baselines, metrics, ablations, and implementation details. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using LLMs for meta-learning [4] and AutoML for RL HPO [2, 3] are known concepts, the core idea of employing an LLM as an *online*, *dynamic* hyperparameter controller that adapts based on *streaming* RL trajectory data appears novel. It distinguishes itself from offline HPO methods like OptFormer by focusing on real-time adaptation. The synthesis of LLM in-context learning, meta-RL formulation for HPO, and application to dynamic adaptation represents a fresh perspective in the AutoRL space."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. Framing hyperparameter adaptation as a meta-MDP is appropriate. The proposed methodology, combining supervised learning on offline data with subsequent meta-RL fine-tuning using policy gradients (specifically mentioning PPO implementation), is a standard and robust approach for learning control policies. The meta-state and meta-reward definitions are plausible. Technical formulations are provided and appear correct. It builds on solid foundations from RL, Meta-RL, and LLM research. Minor potential weaknesses include the inherent sample complexity and stability challenges of meta-RL fine-tuning and the potential complexity of encoding rich trajectory information into effective LLM prompts, but the overall approach is well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents non-trivial implementation challenges. It requires significant computational resources (specified as 50k GPU hours on A100s) and expertise in both LLM fine-tuning and RL/Meta-RL. Data collection via extensive offline tuning is resource-intensive but planned for. Key technical hurdles include engineering the interface between the RL agent and the LLM for real-time prompting, managing potential LLM inference latency during online adaptation (acknowledged as a risk), and ensuring the stability of the meta-RL fine-tuning process. While ambitious, the plan is generally realistic with the stated resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical and pervasive problem of hyperparameter sensitivity and tuning cost in RL, a major barrier to wider adoption. Success would represent a major advancement in AutoRL, potentially leading to more robust, sample-efficient, and easier-to-use RL systems. Automating dynamic HPO could democratize RL application. Furthermore, it explores a novel synergy between LLMs and AutoML/Meta-RL, potentially opening new research avenues in LLM-driven automation of scientific discovery and algorithm design."
