        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on AutoRL by integrating LLMs, Meta-Learning, and AutoML concepts to tackle the challenge of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in RL. The proposal explicitly references the brittleness of RL, the need for automated methods (Eimer et al., 2023), the dynamic nature of HPO landscapes (Mohan et al., 2023), and the potential of LLMs (inspired by OptFormer, ReMA). The research objectives and methodology directly stem from the research idea, focusing on using an LLM for dynamic, online adaptation. It fits squarely within the workshop's targeted areas like 'LLMs for reinforcement learning', 'Meta-reinforcement learning', 'AutoML for reinforcement learning', and 'Hyperparameter agnostic RL algorithms'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, research problem, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely and logically. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the HyperPrompt framework, data collection, prompt engineering, LLM finetuning, dynamic adaptation, and experimental design. The steps are easy to follow, and the rationale behind each component is well-explained. While some implementation details (e.g., exact prompt structure, optimal target generation method) are left for experimental determination, this is clearly stated and appropriate for a proposal. The overall structure is coherent and facilitates immediate understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using sequence models for optimization (OptFormer) or LLMs in RL contexts (LLM agents) exists, the core idea of using a pretrained LLM as an *online, dynamic meta-controller* for RL hyperparameters, driven by *prompts encoding real-time training state*, is a novel synthesis. It differs significantly from standard offline HPO, intermittent online methods like PBT (which typically lack deep contextual understanding from trajectories), and Meta-RL approaches that modify the agent's internal parameters. The integration of LLM in-context learning for this specific AutoRL task represents a fresh perspective, clearly distinct from prior work cited."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, built upon established principles in RL, Meta-Learning, AutoML, and LLMs. The motivation for dynamic HPO is well-supported by the literature (Mohan et al.). The proposed methodology follows a logical structure, and the experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. However, a key challenge affecting soundness is the generation of target hyperparameters (\\theta_t^*) for supervised finetuning of the LLM. The proposal identifies this ('non-trivial') and suggests plausible approaches (offline oracle, heuristics), but the effectiveness and scalability of these methods are uncertain and represent a potential weakness in the proposed training regime. The reliance on prompt engineering, while necessary, also introduces potential fragility. Technical formulations are conceptual but adequate."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning computational resources. Generating a diverse meta-training dataset requires numerous RL runs across varied settings. Finetuning a reasonably sized LLM on this data is computationally intensive. Furthermore, integrating LLM inference into the RL loop for frequent online adaptation adds considerable overhead, potentially slowing down training significantly. While mitigations like using smaller LLMs or adjusting adaptation frequency are mentioned, the overall resource demand appears high. The complexity of prompt engineering and ensuring stable adaptation also adds to the challenge. Success requires substantial computational budget and careful engineering."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in practical RL: the difficulty and cost of hyperparameter tuning, which hinders robustness and wider adoption. Successfully developing HyperPrompt could lead to major advancements in AutoRL, making RL agents more adaptive, sample-efficient, and easier to deploy. By automating dynamic HPO, it directly tackles RL brittleness and lowers the barrier to entry. The work strongly aligns with the goals of the AutoRL community and has the potential to foster cross-pollination between LLM, RL, and AutoML research, potentially leading to transformative changes in how RL systems are developed and applied."
