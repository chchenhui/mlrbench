    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of AutoRL by integrating LLMs, Meta-Learning, and AutoML concepts to tackle the hyperparameter tuning problem in RL, which is explicitly mentioned as a focus area in the task description (LLMs for RL, Meta-RL, AutoML for RL, Hyperparameter importance). The methodology clearly follows the research idea, and the proposal acknowledges and aims to address key challenges identified in the literature review, such as dynamic hyperparameter landscapes and the need for better HPO methods."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology (meta-training and deployment phases), and experimental plan are well-defined. The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist, particularly regarding the exact format and content of the text prompts ('Figure 1' is referenced but not provided) and the specific mechanism for generating the 'optimal responses' needed to finetune the LLM during the meta-training phase. The integration with meta-policy optimization could also benefit from slightly more detail."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. The core idea of using a pretrained LLM, finetuned via meta-learning, to perform *dynamic*, *real-time* hyperparameter adaptation based on trajectory snippets encoded as prompts is novel. This approach differs significantly from existing offline HPO methods (like OptFormer) and traditional meta-RL algorithms that adapt policies rather than hyperparameters. It represents a creative synthesis of LLMs, meta-learning, and AutoRL."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has notable gaps. The conceptual framework (LLM as meta-learner, prompt-based conditioning) is plausible, and the use of established techniques like LLM finetuning and meta-policy optimization provides a basis. However, a critical aspect lacks detail: how the 'optimal responses' (target hyperparameter adjustments) for the LLM meta-training data are generated. Without a clear, sound method for creating this supervision signal, the core training loop's effectiveness is questionable. Furthermore, the assumption that complex RL dynamics and hyperparameter effects can be effectively captured in text prompts for an LLM requires strong empirical validation. The theoretical connection to POMDPs is mentioned but not elaborated upon."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial computational resources for data collection across diverse RL tasks and LLM finetuning. Key technical hurdles include: 1) Designing effective prompts to capture salient information from RL trajectories. 2) The critical, unaddressed challenge of generating the 'optimal' hyperparameter adjustment data for meta-training the LLM. 3) Potential latency issues with integrating real-time LLM inference into the RL training loop. 4) Ensuring the LLM generalizes well and produces stable, beneficial hyperparameter updates. These challenges introduce considerable risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and persistent problem in RL: the difficulty and brittleness associated with hyperparameter tuning. Automating this process dynamically could drastically improve RL's usability, robustness, and sample efficiency, lowering the barrier to entry (democratizing RL) and reducing computational waste. Success would represent a major advancement in AutoRL and could stimulate further research into using LLMs for adaptive control within learning systems. The potential impact is substantial."
