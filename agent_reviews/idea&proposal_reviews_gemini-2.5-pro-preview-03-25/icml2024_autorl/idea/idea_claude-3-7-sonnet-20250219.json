        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for work on 'LLMs for reinforcement learning', 'AutoML for reinforcement learning', and 'Hyperparameter agnostic RL algorithms'. The proposed idea directly combines these elements by using LLMs to achieve hyperparameter-agnostic RL, fitting squarely within the AutoRL theme and addressing the core problem of RL brittleness highlighted in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the proposed two-phase approach (prediction and adaptation) using LLMs is understandable at a high level. The goal of 'plug-and-play' RL is clear. However, specific details on how the LLM observes learning progress, the mechanism for dynamic hyperparameter adjustment, and the structure of the knowledge base are not fully elaborated, leaving some minor ambiguities regarding implementation specifics."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using LLMs for code/configuration generation or prediction has precedents, applying them specifically for *dynamic, adaptive hyperparameter tuning during RL training* based on observed progress is a relatively novel concept. Combining initial prediction based on environment structure with continuous adaptation within a single LLM-driven framework for hyperparameter-agnostic RL offers a fresh perspective compared to traditional AutoRL methods like Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. The first phase (prediction) depends heavily on the availability of a large, diverse dataset linking environment/task descriptions to optimal hyperparameters, which may be difficult to curate. The second phase (dynamic adaptation) presents major hurdles: defining how the LLM effectively 'observes' RL progress, establishing a robust mechanism for the LLM to adjust hyperparameters in real-time without excessive computational overhead or latency, and ensuring the LLM's adjustments are actually beneficial. The interaction loop between the RL agent and the LLM tuner needs careful design and may prove technically complex and slow."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Hyperparameter sensitivity is a well-known, critical bottleneck hindering the practical application and democratization of RL. Developing a truly hyperparameter-agnostic RL algorithm would represent a major advancement in the field, significantly lowering the barrier to entry and potentially enabling much wider adoption of RL techniques. Success in this area would have a substantial impact on AutoRL and the broader ML community."
