        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses the core theme of the workshop: automating reinforcement learning (AutoRL) to overcome its brittleness and accessibility issues. It explicitly proposes using LLMs, a key technology mentioned in the task description, to tackle the challenge of configuring RL setups (algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, reward shaping) from high-level descriptions. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus areas, particularly 'LLMs for reinforcement learning', 'AutoML for reinforcement learning', and the general goal of making RL work 'out-of-the-box'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and generally clear. It clearly states the motivation (RL challenges, LLM capabilities), the core mechanism (LLM translates NL task description to RL configuration), the expected input/output, and the high-level goal (reduce effort, democratize RL). The evaluation plan (testing on benchmarks) is also mentioned. Minor ambiguities exist around the specifics of the 'curated dataset', the exact nature of 'reward function sketches', and whether fine-tuning is essential versus few-shot prompting, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While using LLMs for code/configuration generation is an active area, applying it specifically to generate comprehensive RL setups (algorithm, hyperparameters, reward sketches) directly from natural language task descriptions represents a novel approach within the AutoRL context. It differs from traditional AutoML methods (like Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms for HPO/NAS) and also from work like OptFormer which focuses more on optimization trajectories. The combination of NL understanding for task specification and generation of diverse RL configuration elements offers notable originality."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Accessing powerful LLMs is possible. However, the main hurdle lies in acquiring or creating the 'curated dataset mapping task descriptions to successful RL setups' needed for potential fine-tuning. Defining and collecting 'successful setups' across diverse tasks is non-trivial. Achieving robust performance without fine-tuning (zero/few-shot) might be difficult, especially for complex configurations or reward shaping. Generating meaningful 'reward function sketches' from NL is likely harder than suggesting algorithms or hyperparameters. Standard RL benchmark evaluation is feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and potential impact. It directly targets a major bottleneck in the practical application of RL: the difficulty and expertise required for effective configuration. If successful, this approach could substantially lower the barrier to entry for applying RL, effectively 'democratizing' its use for researchers and practitioners who are not RL experts. This aligns strongly with the goals of AutoRL and could lead to wider adoption and faster progress in applying RL to new domains."
