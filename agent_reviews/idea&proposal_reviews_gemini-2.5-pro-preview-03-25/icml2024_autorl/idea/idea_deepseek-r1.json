        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of Automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL) by proposing a method to automate hyperparameter tuning, a key challenge mentioned in the workshop description ('RL algorithms are brittle to seemingly mundane design choices'). It explicitly integrates multiple focus areas of the workshop: 'LLMs for reinforcement learning', 'Meta-reinforcement learning' (framing HPO as a meta-policy), and 'AutoML for reinforcement learning'. The motivation clearly links to the workshop's goal of making RL work 'out-of-the-box' and reducing brittleness."

        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The core concept of using an LLM as a meta-learner for dynamic hyperparameter adaptation based on real-time feedback is well-defined. The proposed inputs (trajectories, metrics, history) and outputs (hyperparameter updates) are specified. The connection to meta-learning and the planned validation strategy are mentioned. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise structure of the prompts, the specifics of the LLM finetuning process, and the exact mechanism for integrating LLM inference into the RL loop without significant overhead, but the overall research direction is understandable."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using LLMs for RL tasks and meta-learning for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) are existing areas, the proposed approach of using an LLM for *dynamic, online* hyperparameter adaptation *during* an RL agent's training, conditioned on real-time trajectory snippets and framed as a meta-learning problem solved via prompting, is a fresh perspective. It differs significantly from offline AutoML approaches like OptFormer by focusing on real-time, context-aware adjustments within a single training run. The combination of LLM prompting, meta-learning, and dynamic HPO for RL appears novel."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Access to powerful pre-trained LLMs and significant computational resources for finetuning and RL simulation are required. Key technical hurdles include: 1) Designing effective prompts to encode complex, dynamic RL state information (trajectories, performance metrics) concisely for the LLM. 2) Finetuning the LLM to reliably output useful and stable hyperparameter updates. 3) Integrating the LLM inference efficiently into the RL training loop to enable real-time adaptation without prohibitive latency. 4) Generating sufficient and diverse meta-training data, which might require solving many RL tasks with near-optimal hyperparameter schedules (a non-trivial prerequisite). While conceptually sound, successful implementation requires significant engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Hyperparameter tuning is a widely acknowledged bottleneck in applying RL effectively and robustly. Successfully automating dynamic hyperparameter adaptation could drastically reduce the manual effort required, improve agent performance and sample efficiency, and enhance robustness to novel or changing environments. This directly contributes to the goals of AutoRL by making RL more accessible and practical. If successful, it could lead to meaningful advancements in how RL algorithms are developed and deployed."
