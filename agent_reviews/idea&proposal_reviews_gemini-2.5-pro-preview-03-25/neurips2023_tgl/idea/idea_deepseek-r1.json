        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on temporal graph learning, including methods, applications, and specific challenges. The idea proposes a novel temporal graph neural network framework, directly addressing 'Temporal Graph Modelling & Representation Learning'. Crucially, it targets 'Fairness, Explainability, Robustness, Privacy' under 'Temporal Graph Applications', which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest. It also mentions relevant applications like recommender systems and fraud detection, aligning with the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem (dynamic bias in temporal graphs). The main idea details the proposed techniques (adaptive reweighting, adversarial training, time-sensitive regularizer, DP, temporal attention, evolving discriminator) and how they interact. The expected outcomes and impact are specific and directly linked to the proposed method. It is articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While temporal GNNs and fairness techniques exist independently, the core novelty lies in the *adaptive* application of fairness constraints specifically tailored to the *dynamics* of temporal graphs. The combination of a time-sensitive fairness regularizer using a sliding window, adaptive reweighting, evolving adversarial training, and differential privacy within a single temporal GNN framework to combat *bias drift* appears innovative. It offers a fresh perspective on integrating fairness into evolving graph structures, going beyond static or simplistic temporal adaptations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Temporal GNNs, adversarial training, fairness regularization, and differential privacy are established techniques. However, integrating them into a cohesive framework that adapts *dynamically* based on evolving graph snapshots requires careful design and significant engineering effort. The 'adaptive reweighting' and 'evolving fairness discriminator' need precise definition and implementation. Finding or creating suitable large-scale dynamic graph datasets with ground-truth fairness attributes over time might also pose a challenge, although potential dataset types are mentioned. Computational cost could be high due to the complexity."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing fairness in dynamic systems like social networks, recommendation systems, and financial transaction graphs is critical as AI decisions increasingly affect individuals over time. Static fairness approaches are insufficient for evolving biases (bias drift), making research into dynamic fairness crucial. This work directly tackles this gap, potentially leading to major advancements in responsible AI for temporal data and enabling more equitable outcomes in real-world, time-sensitive applications."
