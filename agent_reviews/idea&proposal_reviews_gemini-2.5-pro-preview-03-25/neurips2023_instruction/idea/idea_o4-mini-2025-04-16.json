    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses core themes like 'Instruction Tuning and Instruction Following', specifically focusing on 'Modeling' (new algorithms/pipelines/objectives for learning from instructions), 'Evaluation and Oversight' (interpretability, enforcing guardrails), and 'Limitations, Risks and Safety' (hallucination, safety concerns, robustness to adversarial inputs). The proposed method aims to improve the reliability and safety of instruction-following models, which is a central concern highlighted in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation, main idea (co-training I2O and O2I modules with cycle consistency), methodology (initialization, training steps, evaluation), and expected outcomes are clearly defined and easy to understand. The concept of using cycle consistency for instruction alignment is well-articulated, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While cycle consistency itself is an established concept (e.g., CycleGAN in vision), its application to enforce alignment between natural language instructions and LLM outputs via a dedicated Output-to-Instruction (O2I) module appears innovative within the context of instruction tuning. Combining this with standard instruction following losses and adversarial robustness objectives presents a fresh approach to improving LLM reliability and safety."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It leverages existing pre-trained instruction-tuned models (for I2O) and standard training techniques (alternating gradient steps, multiple loss functions). While training a second module (O2I) and computing the cycle loss adds complexity and computational overhead compared to standard fine-tuning, it doesn't seem prohibitive given current ML infrastructure. Required datasets (instruction-output pairs) and evaluation benchmarks (adversarial prompts) are generally available or can be constructed."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds excellent significance. It targets critical limitations of current instruction-tuned LLMs: susceptibility to ambiguous/adversarial prompts, hallucination, and lack of robustness, which are major barriers to safe and reliable deployment. Improving instruction alignment and providing a mechanism (reconstruction error) to potentially detect misalignment could lead to major advancements in LLM trustworthiness and safety, addressing key concerns outlined in the task description."
