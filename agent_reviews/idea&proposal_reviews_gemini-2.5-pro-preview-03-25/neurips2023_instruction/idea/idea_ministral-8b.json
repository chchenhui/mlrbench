    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly lists 'personalized instruction-following models' as a relevant topic under 'Applications'. The idea directly addresses this by proposing an 'Adaptive Instruction Tuning for Personalized Learning' framework. It also touches upon other relevant topics mentioned in the task, such as 'Modeling' (designing training objectives and rewards based on user feedback), 'Data Collection' (crowd-sourcing user interactions and feedback), and 'Evaluation' (using standard benchmarks and user-specific metrics)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, main steps (Data Collection, Personalized Training, Real-time Adaptation, Evaluation), expected outcomes, and potential impact are clearly outlined. The core concept of using feedback for adaptive tuning is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific mechanisms for 'real-time adaptation' and how 'scalability without significant computational overhead' will be achieved, but the overall research direction is well-defined."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While personalization for LLMs is an existing research area, the specific focus on 'adaptive instruction tuning' that combines per-user fine-tuning with 'real-time adaptation' based on continuous feedback and behavioral data presents a fresh perspective. It builds upon existing instruction tuning work but aims to make it dynamic and user-specific in a continuous loop, which is a valuable and innovative direction within the field."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Data collection requires robust infrastructure and careful handling of user privacy. Per-user fine-tuning can be computationally intensive, raising questions about the claimed scalability 'without significant computational overhead' â€“ this likely requires novel parameter-efficient techniques or architectures not detailed here. Implementing effective 'real-time adaptation' for large models is technically demanding. While conceptually sound, significant engineering effort and potentially new methods are needed for practical implementation, especially at scale."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Personalizing LLM interactions to individual user needs and preferences is a critical step towards more effective and user-centric AI systems. Successfully developing adaptive instruction tuning could lead to substantial improvements in user satisfaction and task success rates across various applications (e.g., education, customer service, accessibility tools), advancing the field of personalized AI."
