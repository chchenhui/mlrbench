    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'long-context instruction-following models' application area mentioned in the task description, along with 'modeling algorithms' and 'training and inference efficiency'. The proposal elaborates significantly on the core research idea, providing concrete mechanisms (Relevance Assessment, Hierarchical Attention). It effectively synthesizes the literature review, positioning DCW as a novel solution to the identified challenges (computational complexity, attention limitations in long contexts) by proposing an instruction-aware dynamic approach, distinct from fixed sparse patterns (Longformer) or general efficiency improvements (LongLoRA, HyperAttention)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, conceptual framework, and overall methodology are articulated well. The structure is logical, progressing from background to methodology and expected outcomes. The inclusion of mathematical formulations for relevance scoring and the DCW-Attention mechanism aids understanding. Minor areas for improvement include: the textual representation of 'Figure 1' is less clear than a visual diagram would be, the exact nature of the sparse attention pattern S(ti, tj) could be more explicitly defined, and some details regarding the relevance assessor pre-training data could be elaborated. Overall, the proposal is understandable with only slight refinements needed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While efficient attention mechanisms and adaptive attention spans exist (as noted in the literature review), the core novelty lies in the *instruction-driven* dynamic adaptation of attention in a *hierarchical* manner for long documents. Specifically, the two-stage process involving an explicit instruction-aware relevance assessment module that directly guides a tiered attention allocation mechanism appears distinct from prior work like Longformer (fixed/local patterns), Reformer (LSH), or Adaptive Attention Span (learned spans not explicitly instruction-driven). The integration of relevance assessment directly into the attention mask calculation based on instruction semantics is a fresh approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid foundations (Transformer architecture, attention mechanisms, instruction tuning, LoRA) and established techniques (dual-encoders for similarity, sparse attention). The proposed methodology, including the relevance assessment module and the hierarchical attention mechanism with a modified mask, is technically plausible and well-reasoned. The multi-stage training plan with a combined loss function is a standard and appropriate strategy. Minor weaknesses include the reliance on the quality of the relevance assessment module and the need for careful tuning of hyperparameters (tier percentages p, q, r; loss weight lambda; cross-tier attention scalars alpha). The mathematical formulation for DCW-Attention is presented but requires empirical validation for stability and effectiveness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation effort. Access to pre-trained LLMs and substantial computational resources for fine-tuning (especially on long contexts) is necessary. Implementing the custom hierarchical attention mechanism requires modifying existing transformer libraries. The data collection and annotation phase, particularly creating a large dataset of long documents with relevance annotations, is resource-intensive, although proposed mitigation strategies like synthetic data and distillation help. Using LoRA enhances feasibility by reducing parameter overhead. Overall, it's achievable within a well-equipped research lab but requires considerable engineering and data curation effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the effective and efficient processing of long documents under specific instructions, a key bottleneck for current LLMs. Success would lead to substantial improvements in critical applications (legal, research, healthcare). The potential impact is high, offering both performance gains and computational efficiency, contributing to more sustainable AI. By enabling deeper understanding of long texts based on user needs, it could significantly advance human-AI collaboration in knowledge-intensive domains. The expected outcomes, if realized, would represent a major contribution to the field."
