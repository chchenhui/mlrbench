    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'long-context' application area mentioned in the task description and focuses on 'training and inference efficiency' and 'modeling algorithms'. The core idea of 'Dynamic Context Windows' (DCW) perfectly matches the research idea provided. Furthermore, the methodology explicitly builds upon and differentiates itself from the efficient transformer techniques discussed in the literature review (LongLoRA, Hyena, CCA, Longformer, etc.), addressing the key challenges identified, such as computational complexity and attention limitations in long contexts."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated. The DCW framework is broken down into logical stages (Segmentation, Allocation, Information Flow) with architectural details and mathematical formulations provided for key components. The training strategy and experimental design are well-articulated. The significance and expected outcomes are clearly presented. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the lack of the referenced Figure 1 and potentially needing slightly more detail on the exact implementation of sparse/local attention patterns or the justification for the specific tier percentages (though ablation is mentioned). Overall, the proposal is easy to understand and follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing work in efficient attention mechanisms (sparse, local, adaptive span, core context), the core novelty lies in the *instruction-aware dynamic segmentation* and the *hierarchical tiered attention allocation* based on this segmentation. Unlike prior methods that often apply uniform approximations or static patterns, DCW proposes adapting attention based specifically on the *semantics of the instruction* relative to the context. This instruction-guided dynamic approach for long-context attention management is a fresh perspective and is clearly distinguished from the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established concepts like transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and classification. The proposed two-phase approach (classify then attend) is logical. Using different attention types (full, sparse, local) for different segments is a reasonable strategy grounded in prior work on efficient transformers. The training strategy with contrastive loss and joint optimization is standard. However, the specific tier thresholds (20%/30%/50%) seem somewhat arbitrary initially and require empirical validation (planned via ablation). The theoretical complexity claim of O(n log n) is plausible for sparse/hierarchical attention but lacks rigorous derivation within the proposal itself. The reliance on synthetic data also requires careful validation for real-world generalization."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology but presents significant engineering and resource challenges. Implementing the classifier and tiered attention mechanisms is technically achievable. However, training/fine-tuning LLMs on sequences up to 100k tokens requires substantial computational resources (GPU clusters). Generating high-quality, diverse synthetic data (50k examples) and curating human data (10k examples) is a considerable undertaking. While the plan is generally realistic, success depends heavily on access to compute and the effectiveness of the data generation process. The risks associated with classifier accuracy and threshold tuning are acknowledged via planned ablation studies."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical bottleneck in current LLM capabilities: efficient and effective processing of long-context instructions. Success would enable or greatly improve applications in high-value domains like legal analysis, scientific research synthesis, and complex enterprise workflows. The potential for substantial efficiency gains (40-60% reduction in overhead, 2.1x throughput) combined with improved accuracy and reduced hallucination addresses major practical limitations. The goals of democratization (running on consumer GPUs), safety, and sustainability further amplify the potential impact. The research directly contributes to a key area highlighted in the task description."
