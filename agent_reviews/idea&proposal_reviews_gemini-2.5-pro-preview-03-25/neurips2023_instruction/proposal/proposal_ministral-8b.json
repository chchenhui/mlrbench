    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'long-context instruction-following models' application area mentioned in the task description. The core concept of 'Dynamic Context Windows' (DCW) perfectly matches the research idea, elaborating on the motivation and main components. Furthermore, the proposal effectively situates DCW within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging existing work on long-context efficiency (LongLoRA, HyperAttention, Longformer, etc.) and positioning DCW as a novel approach to tackle the identified challenges of computational complexity and attention limitations in long-text instruction following."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically. The two-phase DCW architecture (lightweight classification and attention processing) is understandable. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are clearly specified. Minor areas could benefit from refinement: the exact nature of the 'lightweight classifier' and the precise mechanism by which segment labels modify the attention mechanism (beyond 'prioritizing' and 'sparse patterns') could be more detailed. The mathematical formulas provided are high-level placeholders rather than detailed specifications, but the overall concept remains clear."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing concepts like sparse attention and efficient transformers (referenced in the literature review), the core idea of using a *dynamic, instruction-guided lightweight classifier* to segment text into importance zones *before* applying differential attention (full vs. sparse) appears novel. This contrasts with methods using fixed sparse patterns (Longformer), learned adaptive spans without explicit instruction guidance (Adaptive Attention Span), or general efficiency improvements (HyperAttention, Linformer). The novelty lies in the specific combination of instruction-aware dynamic segmentation feeding into a hybrid attention mechanism for long-context instruction following."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established concepts like transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and classification. The proposed two-phase methodology (classify then attend differentially) is logical. The experimental plan is comprehensive, covering benchmarking, efficiency, and task-specific evaluation. However, the technical formulations (mathematical equations) are overly simplistic placeholders and lack detail regarding the specific implementation of the classifier-attention interface and the sparse attention patterns. The assumption that a 'lightweight' classifier can be both effective and efficient enough needs empirical validation, but the overall approach is technically plausible."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. Developing a lightweight classifier and modifying attention mechanisms are achievable with current ML frameworks, though integrating them seamlessly and efficiently requires careful engineering. The data collection plan (crowdsourcing, synthetic data, existing datasets) is standard but potentially resource-intensive, especially for creating tailored instruction-document pairs. Significant computational resources (GPUs, time) will be needed for training and evaluation. Key risks include the classifier's accuracy/overhead potentially limiting gains and the sparse attention losing critical information, but these are manageable research risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and well-recognized bottleneck in LLMs: efficiently and effectively processing very long texts, particularly in the context of following complex instructions. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in LLM capabilities for applications requiring deep understanding of extensive documents (e.g., legal analysis, scientific literature review, complex Q&A). Improving efficiency while maintaining or enhancing performance on such tasks would have substantial practical impact and broaden the applicability of LLMs. The potential contribution to the field is substantial."
