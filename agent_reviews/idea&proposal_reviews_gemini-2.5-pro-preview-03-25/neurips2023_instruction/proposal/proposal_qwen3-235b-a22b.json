    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (focusing on long-context instruction following, efficiency, data generation, and evaluation), the research idea (detailing the Dynamic Context Windows concept with its two-phase architecture), and the literature review (addressing key challenges like computational complexity and attention limitations, positioning itself relative to existing efficient Transformer methods). It comprehensively integrates all provided context elements without significant gaps or inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The problem, proposed solution (DCW), high-level architecture, and expected impact are articulated clearly. The methodology section provides a good overview with mathematical formulations for the relevance score and masking matrix. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of the 'lean Transformer variant' for the classifier, how relevance scores \\\\alpha(i) are aggregated into segments C and B, and the specific value or nature of \\\\epsilon in the mask. However, these do not obscure the core concepts."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing concepts like sparse attention and adaptive mechanisms (referenced in the literature review), the core idea of using an explicit, instruction-aware classifier in a first phase to dynamically determine relevance segments (C and B) which then guide a structured sparse attention mechanism in a second phase appears novel. This instruction-driven, two-stage dynamic adaptation distinguishes it from prior work like fixed sparse patterns (Longformer), general adaptive spans, or methods focusing solely on approximating full attention (HyperAttention, Linformer)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on the established Transformer framework and attention principles. The two-phase approach (classify relevance, then attend adaptively) is logical. The mathematical formulations for the relevance score and the attention mask are plausible and correctly represent the intended mechanism. The evaluation plan using standard benchmarks and metrics is appropriate. However, the overall success heavily depends on the effectiveness of the initial relevance classifier, which could be a bottleneck. The proposal acknowledges related work but could elaborate slightly more on how the aggregation of relevance scores into zones works. The reliance on synthetic data also introduces assumptions about its representativeness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. The architectural components (classifier, masked attention) are technically implementable within standard ML frameworks. However, the generation of high-quality synthetic data with accurate relevance segment annotations for diverse instructions and long documents is a significant hurdle and potential risk. Training such a model, even with efficiency gains, will require substantial computational resources. While fine-tuning existing models helps, the complexity of the two-phase system and data requirements lower the feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical bottleneck in LLMs â€“ efficient and effective processing of long texts under specific instructions. This limitation hinders applications in numerous important domains (legal, scientific, medical). A successful DCW framework could lead to major advancements in LLM capabilities for these tasks, improve efficiency (potentially democratizing access), and contribute a novel architectural paradigm for dynamic resource allocation in LLMs."
