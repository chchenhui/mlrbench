    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on long-context instruction following, efficiency, modeling, and applications. The methodology faithfully implements the core research idea of Dynamic Context Windows (DCW) with its two-phase architecture. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself relative to the cited literature (e.g., LongLoRA, sparse attention methods) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified, such as computational complexity and attention limitations in long documents. All sections of the proposal consistently reinforce the central theme and objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Key concepts like DCW, CRC, and DA-LLM are defined, and the two-phase approach is explained well. Mathematical formulations for relevance scoring and attention modification are provided. The experimental design is comprehensive and easy to understand. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of 'silver labels' for CRC training and the exact construction of the block-wise attention mask matrix M, but these do not significantly impede overall comprehension."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While leveraging existing concepts like sparse attention, instruction tuning, and classifiers, the core novelty lies in their specific integration: a two-stage architecture where a separate, lightweight Context Relevance Classifier (CRC) explicitly predicts segment relevance based on the *instruction*, and these predictions dynamically modulate the attention patterns of the main LLM. This instruction-conditional dynamic sparsity appears distinct from prior work focusing on fixed sparse patterns (Longformer), learned but not explicitly instruction-conditioned spans (Adaptive Attention Span), or general efficiency approximations (HyperAttention, Linformer). The novelty is clearly articulated and represents a fresh approach to instruction-guided long-context processing."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (Transformers, attention mechanisms, classification) and established techniques (LoRA). The proposed two-stage methodology (CRC + DA-LLM) is logical, and the technical formulations for relevance scoring and attention modification are appropriate. The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines, diverse tasks, standard metrics, efficiency analysis, and crucial ablations. Potential weaknesses include the dependency on high-quality CRC training data (human or silver labels) and the potential sub-optimality of fixed segmentation and discrete attention thresholds, but these are acknowledged or addressable via the planned experiments."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing LLMs (Llama2-7B), standard hardware (GPUs), and established techniques (LoRA, BERT-style encoders). Leveraging existing datasets reduces the burden, and synthetic data generation is a common practice. Using LoRA makes fine-tuning more accessible. The main challenges involve engineering the custom dynamic attention mechanism and ensuring the CRC module performs well, potentially requiring significant effort in data curation (especially if silver labels are insufficient) or annotation. However, these challenges seem manageable within a typical research project scope."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical bottleneck in current LLMs: efficiently and effectively following instructions over very long documents (>100k tokens). Success would unlock numerous high-impact applications in legal tech, scientific research, education, and more. The potential for substantial improvements in both accuracy (5-10% claimed) and efficiency (30-50% memory reduction, 2x throughput claimed) would represent a major advancement. Furthermore, the commitment to open-sourcing code and data enhances its potential contribution to the research community."
