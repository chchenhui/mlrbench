        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the workshop call: leveraging recent advancements in generative models (specifically diffusion models), synthetic data generation for health applications, tackling data scarcity and privacy concerns in medical datasets, and potentially targeting rare diseases (a specific area of interest mentioned). The focus on federated learning combined with diffusion models represents an advance tailored towards health applications, fitting the workshop's scope excellently."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (privacy-preserving synthetic medical data generation), the core technique (federated diffusion models), the proposed methods (local training, secure aggregation exploration like SMC/DP), and the evaluation plan (image quality, utility, privacy) are explicitly stated and easy to understand. There are no significant ambiguities in the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While federated learning and diffusion models exist independently, their combination, especially tailored for high-resolution medical image generation with specific considerations for secure aggregation (SMC/DP) and evaluation in a medical context (rare diseases), offers a fresh perspective. It addresses a known challenge (privacy in generative modeling for medical data) using a state-of-the-art generative model within a privacy-preserving framework, which is an innovative approach in this specific domain."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training diffusion models is computationally intensive, and federated learning adds communication overhead and system complexity. Implementing secure aggregation techniques like SMC can be complex and slow, while DP often involves a trade-off with model utility/image quality. Accessing distributed medical data across institutions, even for FL, requires navigating complex data sharing agreements and technical infrastructure setup. While conceptually sound, the practical realization requires substantial engineering effort, computational resources, and potentially compromises on aggregation speed or privacy/utility balance."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully developing federated diffusion models for medical images would address the critical bottleneck of data scarcity and privacy constraints in medical AI research. It could enable the generation of high-fidelity, diverse synthetic datasets reflecting multi-institutional data characteristics without centralizing sensitive patient information. This could accelerate research, particularly for rare diseases, improve the robustness of diagnostic models, and facilitate broader collaboration in the medical field."
