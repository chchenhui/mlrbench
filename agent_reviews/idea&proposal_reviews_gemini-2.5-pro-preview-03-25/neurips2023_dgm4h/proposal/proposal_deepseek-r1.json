    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop task (deep generative models, diffusion, health applications, multimodality, data scarcity, explainability, robustness, rare diseases). It faithfully translates the research idea into a detailed plan, incorporating concepts like multimodal diffusion, adaptive training, and explainability. Furthermore, it positions itself well within the context of the provided literature, citing relevant recent works (MedM2G, MedCoDi-M, DiffMIC) and addressing the key challenges identified (data scarcity, modality integration, missing data, explainability, validation)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the overall structure (Introduction, Methodology, Outcomes, Conclusion) is logical. The methodology section describes the data, model architecture components (encoders, fusion, diffusion), training strategy, and evaluation plan comprehensibly. Equations for key mechanisms (attention, diffusion forward process) are provided. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the lack of the referenced Figure 1 (though described textually) and the precise mechanism for integrating medical ontologies into the attention scores, but these do not significantly hinder understanding of the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced techniques (multimodal diffusion, cross-attention fusion, adaptive training via modality masking, domain-specific attention using ontologies, explainability modules) into a unified framework specifically tailored for robust and explainable healthcare diagnostics, particularly targeting rare diseases. While individual components like multimodal diffusion (MedM2G, MedCoDi-M) and robustness techniques (attention, masking - potentially concurrent work) exist, the specific combination, the hierarchical approach, and the proposed use of medical ontologies within the attention mechanism offer a fresh perspective distinct from the cited works. The novelty lies more in the synergistic integration and specific application focus than in inventing entirely new core methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (diffusion models, attention mechanisms, standard neural network architectures). The proposed methodology, including modality-specific encoding, cross-attention fusion, diffusion on the latent space, and adaptive training, is technically coherent. The inclusion of relevant baselines, appropriate metrics for diverse tasks (classification, generation, explainability), and planned ablation studies indicates methodological rigor. A minor weakness is the lack of specific detail on how medical ontologies will be technically integrated into the attention mechanism, which requires further elaboration for full assessment of its soundness. The use of diffusion model latent space for classification is plausible (supported by DiffMIC) but requires strong empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The core methods (diffusion models, transformers, CNNs) are implementable using standard libraries. Public datasets like MIMIC-CXR and BraTS are accessible. However, training complex multimodal diffusion models is computationally intensive, requiring substantial GPU resources. Accessing and curating 'custom rare disease datasets' could pose significant logistical and ethical hurdles. The clinician evaluation for explainability requires establishing collaborations. While technically achievable with adequate resources and expertise, the computational cost and potential data acquisition challenges make it moderately difficult but not impractical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical, unmet needs in medical AI: robust handling of multimodal data, resilience to missing/noisy inputs, mitigating data scarcity for rare diseases and underrepresented groups, and providing explainable predictions for clinical trust. Success would lead to more reliable diagnostic tools, potentially improving patient outcomes, especially in challenging cases. The focus on synthetic data generation for rare diseases could democratize research in these areas. By aiming to bridge the gap between AI advancements and clinical practice with a focus on robustness and explainability, the work has substantial potential for meaningful contribution to the field and aligns perfectly with the goals of the workshop."
