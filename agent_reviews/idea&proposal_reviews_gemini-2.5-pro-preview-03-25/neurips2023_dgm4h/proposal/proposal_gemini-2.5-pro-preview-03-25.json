        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for leveraging advanced generative models (specifically diffusion models) for health applications, focusing on key challenges like multimodality, data scarcity, missing data, and interpretability. The proposed RMDM framework is a direct implementation of the research idea, incorporating hierarchical fusion, adaptive training for robustness, domain-specific attention, and explainability. The introduction and methodology explicitly reference the provided literature and key challenges, ensuring the work is well-grounded in the context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, problem statement, proposed solution (RMDM), and research objectives are articulated concisely and logically. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the architecture, training strategy (including mathematical formulations for the diffusion process), datasets, experimental design, and evaluation metrics. The structure is easy to follow, and technical terms are used appropriately. Minor details, such as the precise architecture of the fusion module or the exact mechanism for domain knowledge integration via attention, could be further specified, but the overall plan is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it builds upon existing work in multimodal learning, diffusion models (MedM2G, MedCoDi-M, DiffMIC, MedSegDiff), and robustness techniques (Johnson et al., Curie et al., Tesla et al.), the specific combination is novel. The core innovation lies in designing a multimodal diffusion model *explicitly* optimized for robustness against missing modalities in healthcare diagnostics through an adaptive masking strategy during training, coupled with domain-guided attention mechanisms within the diffusion framework. This tailored approach for robust multimodal diagnostic generation using diffusion models distinguishes it clearly from prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations of diffusion models, multimodal deep learning, and attention mechanisms. The proposed methodology (modality-specific encoders, hierarchical fusion, conditional diffusion, adaptive training) is technically robust and well-justified. The mathematical formulation of the diffusion process is correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse evaluation scenarios (complete vs. missing data), and appropriate metrics covering performance, robustness, and interpretability. The use of established datasets further strengthens the soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Using public datasets is practical. However, training large-scale multimodal diffusion models is computationally intensive, requiring substantial GPU resources as acknowledged. Implementing and tuning the complex RMDM architecture with its multiple components (encoders, fusion, attention, diffusion) and the adaptive training strategy will require significant engineering effort and expertise. While conceptually sound, achieving stable training and optimal performance might require considerable experimentation. The feasibility hinges on access to adequate computational resources and skilled researchers."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical, unmet needs in healthcare AI: robust handling of multimodal data, resilience to missing information (a major real-world barrier), improving diagnostics for rare diseases/underserved populations (addressing data scarcity and equity), and enhancing clinical trust through interpretability. Success would represent a major advancement in applying generative models clinically, directly aligning with the workshop's goals. The potential impact on diagnostic accuracy, clinical workflow integration, and health equity is substantial."
