    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop call (deep generative models, specifically diffusion, for health), focuses on key challenges highlighted (multimodal data integration, scarcity/missingness, explainability, robustness, rare diseases), and builds upon the provided research idea (multimodal diffusion, robustness via masking, domain knowledge integration, explainability). It incorporates and aims to outperform relevant recent works mentioned in the literature review (MedM2G, DiffMIC) and tackles the key challenges identified therein."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the approach, including specific architectures (ResNet, BERT, MLP), mathematical formulations for fusion and diffusion, training objectives, and a comprehensive experimental plan. Figures are mentioned (though not provided here), suggesting visual aids. Minor details, like the exact architecture of the score network or the precise formulation of auxiliary losses (L_adv, L_IG-reg), could be elaborated, but the overall proposal is immediately understandable and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced techniques in a novel configuration for robust multimodal medical diagnosis. While individual components (diffusion models, multimodal fusion, attention, ontology integration, adaptive masking, integrated gradients) exist, their specific combination within a unified framework (MH-Diff) is innovative. Key novel aspects include the ontology-guided cross-modal attention mechanism directly influencing the fusion process before diffusion, and the use of adaptive modality masking specifically to train a diffusion-based classifier for robustness. It clearly distinguishes itself from cited works like MedM2G (generation-focused) and DiffMIC (image classification-focused)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (continuous-time diffusion models, attention mechanisms, standard encoders) and methods (score matching, integrated gradients). The proposed methodology, including the fusion mechanism, diffusion process, adaptive masking, and classification head, is logical and well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, multiple datasets (including external validation), diverse metrics, and ablation studies. Minor weaknesses include the lack of detail on the adversarial and IG regularization losses and the need for empirical validation of the specific ontology integration method, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The required datasets (MIMIC-CXR, UK Biobank) are standard research resources, although access to the institutional ICU registry requires confirmation. The proposed methods (CNNs, BERT, MLPs, attention, diffusion models) are implementable using standard frameworks like PyTorch. The proposal acknowledges the need for significant computational resources (8xA100 GPUs), which is realistic for diffusion model training. Key risks involve the computational cost and potential challenges in tuning the complex model and loss function, but the plan is generally realistic and implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses highly significant challenges in medical AI: integrating multimodal data, ensuring robustness to missing information, improving performance on rare diseases and underrepresented groups, and providing explainability for clinical trust. These align perfectly with the goals of the workshop task. If successful, the MH-Diff framework could lead to substantial improvements in diagnostic accuracy, equity, and clinical adoption of AI tools. The focus on robustness and explainability, combined with strong performance claims (+3-5% AUC, <2% drop), indicates high potential impact on both the research field and clinical practice."
