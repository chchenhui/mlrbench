    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (workshop themes), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on embodied LLM agents in open city environments, tackling challenges like dynamics, scale, spatial intelligence, reasoning, planning, decision-making, multi-agent collaboration, and explicitly contributing to Topic 5 (Simulators, testbeds, datasets, benchmark). The proposal logically expands on the core research idea of UrbanVerse and effectively uses the literature review to identify gaps (e.g., limitations of EmbodiedCity, CityBench) and justify the need for a more dynamic, stochastic, multi-agent focused platform. It comprehensively covers the key challenges highlighted in the provided context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Problem Statement, Objectives, Significance, Methodology, Expected Outcomes). The objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly through the project scope). The methodology section provides substantial detail on the planned architecture, components (GIS integration, dynamic agent simulation, environmental factors, stochastic events, API), benchmark tasks, and evaluation metrics. The language is precise and academic. While intricate technical details of the API or specific procedural generation algorithms could be further elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While acknowledging existing platforms like EmbodiedCity [1] and CityBench [3], UrbanVerse differentiates itself by emphasizing the *integration* of several key features specifically for evaluating LLM agents: high-fidelity dynamics (diverse agents, weather, time), explicit modeling of *stochastic events* (accidents, closures) to test robustness [10], a strong focus on *multi-agent collaboration* tasks [6], and a comprehensive benchmark suite tailored to these complexities. While individual components (e.g., GIS-based generation, dynamic simulation [7]) exist, the proposed synergistic platform combining these elements with a dedicated benchmark suite for LLM agents in such challenging conditions represents a significant and novel contribution beyond the cited prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid foundations by proposing the use of established game engines (Unreal/Unity), standard GIS data (OSM), and well-known simulation models (Social Force Model, Intelligent Driver Model). The proposed benchmark tasks (Navigation, ESR-QA [2], Planning, Collaboration [6]) are relevant and cover critical capabilities. The chosen evaluation metrics (SPL, Safety Score, etc.) are appropriate and standard in the field. The experimental design includes necessary components like baseline comparisons and ablation studies. The technical formulation provided (SPL) is correct. The methodology is well-justified, although achieving the desired level of behavioral realism for dynamic agents and stochastic events often presents subtle challenges that might require further refinement during implementation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges due to its ambitious scope. Developing a high-fidelity, dynamic, multi-agent simulator with integrated GIS data, stochastic events, varied environmental conditions, and a flexible API is a complex, resource-intensive task. It requires substantial expertise in game development, simulation modeling (pedestrian/traffic), GIS processing, and AI integration. Integrating all components seamlessly and ensuring realistic agent behaviors and event interactions are major hurdles. While the plan is outlined, the required effort and potential roadblocks might be underestimated, making the feasibility satisfactory but challenging without significant resources and a dedicated team."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized gap [8] in the embodied AI field: the lack of robust, dynamic, and standardized evaluation platforms for agents operating in complex open outdoor environments like cities. If successful, UrbanVerse could substantially accelerate research progress by providing a much-needed testbed for developing and comparing LLM agents. It would facilitate the creation of more robust, safe, and capable agents [10], foster reproducible research through standardized benchmarks, help bridge the sim-to-real gap, and potentially enable new real-world applications (autonomous delivery, emergency response), aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
