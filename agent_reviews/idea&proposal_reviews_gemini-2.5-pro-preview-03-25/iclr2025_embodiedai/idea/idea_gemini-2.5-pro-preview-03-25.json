        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on Embodied Intelligence with LLMs in Open City Environments, specifically mentioning challenges like spatial reasoning and embodied perception. The idea directly addresses Topic (1) 'Spatial Intelligence and Embodied Perception with LLM Agents in Open City Environment' by proposing a concrete framework for grounding LLM spatial and temporal reasoning using continuous sensor data in urban settings. It tackles the core problem highlighted in the workshop motivation: LLMs struggling with dynamic spatial awareness in large-scale outdoor environments."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation clearly states the problem. The main idea outlines the key components (perception module, spatio-temporal representation, LLM integration) and the overall process. The expected outcomes are specific and relevant. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact nature of the spatio-temporal representation and the specific integration mechanism (fine-tuning vs. specialized tokens), but the core concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While grounding LLMs in perception is an active research area, the specific focus on *continuous* spatio-temporal grounding using dynamic representations (like scene graphs with timestamps) derived from embodied sensors (video/LiDAR) specifically for *urban environments* offers a fresh perspective. Integrating this dynamic, structured representation directly into the LLM's context to improve understanding of concepts like 'recently passed' or relative motion adds a layer of innovation beyond static scene understanding."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While components like perception modules (object detection, SLAM) and LLM fine-tuning exist, integrating them into a cohesive system that processes continuous streams, generates dynamic spatio-temporal representations, and effectively grounds the LLM in real-time is complex. It requires substantial engineering effort, access to relevant datasets (or simulation environments) capturing dynamic urban scenes, and considerable computational resources for both perception processing and LLM integration/training. The practicality depends heavily on the chosen complexity of the representation and integration method."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the lack of robust spatio-temporal grounding is a critical bottleneck for deploying LLM agents in dynamic real-world environments like cities. Success in this area could lead to major advancements in autonomous navigation, human-robot interaction in urban settings, and overall situational awareness for embodied AI. It directly tackles a fundamental challenge in making LLMs truly 'embodied' in complex, open-world scenarios, aligning perfectly with the goals of advancing embodied intelligence."
