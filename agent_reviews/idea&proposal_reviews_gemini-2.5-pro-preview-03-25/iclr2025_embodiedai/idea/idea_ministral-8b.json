        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of embodied intelligence for LLMs in open city environments. Specifically, it tackles workshop topics (1) Spatial Intelligence and Embodied Perception, (2) Reasoning and planning, (3) Decision-making and Action, touches upon (4) Multi-agent collaboration (as an expected outcome), and acknowledges the need for (5) Simulators and testbeds. The motivation explicitly mentions the challenges highlighted in the workshop description (navigation, search, spatial reasoning, planning in outdoor settings)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly with distinct sections for motivation, main idea, methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact. The core concepts – integrating multi-modal perception (visual, auditory, tactile) and spatial reasoning into LLMs for open city environments – are well-defined and easy to understand. The three-step methodology provides a clear, albeit high-level, plan. While specific algorithmic details are omitted (which is acceptable for an idea description), the overall research direction and goals are crystal clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While research exists on LLMs, embodied AI, multi-modal learning, and spatial reasoning individually, this proposal integrates these specifically for the challenging domain of *open city environments*. The focus on combining multi-modal perception (including tactile, which is less common in this context) with dedicated spatial reasoning algorithms for dynamic outdoor settings offers a fresh perspective. It pushes existing research frontiers into a more complex and less explored application area compared to indoor or static environments."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Integrating visual and auditory data is standard practice. However, incorporating meaningful *tactile* sensing for agents navigating large, complex open city environments is technically challenging both in hardware/sensor deployment and data interpretation. Developing robust spatial reasoning for dynamic, large-scale outdoor scenes is difficult. Furthermore, creating *realistic* simulators that capture the multi-modal complexity (including tactile interactions) of open cities is a major hurdle, as is acquiring sufficient real-world or simulated training data. Significant resources and effort would be required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. It tackles a fundamental limitation of current AI systems – their lack of robust embodied intelligence in complex, real-world settings like cities. Progress in this area could lead to major advancements in autonomous systems (e.g., delivery robots, search and rescue drones, assistive technologies) capable of navigating and interacting within human environments. Enhancing LLMs with spatial reasoning and multi-modal perception has broad implications. The development of associated simulators, datasets, and benchmarks would also be a valuable contribution to the research community."
