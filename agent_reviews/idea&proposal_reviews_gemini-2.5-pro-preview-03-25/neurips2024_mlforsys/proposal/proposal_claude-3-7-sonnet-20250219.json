    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for using ML (specifically LLMs) for compute sustainability and energy-aware job scheduling, moving beyond simple heuristic replacement. It comprehensively elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the LLM approach, data integration, continuous learning, and performance goals. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging recent advancements (PCAPS, CASPER) and explicitly aiming to improve upon them by leveraging LLM capabilities to tackle identified challenges like complex data integration and balancing performance with carbon reduction."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (data, LLM design, implementation, evaluation), and expected impact are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. However, there is a minor lack of clarity regarding the exact mechanism by which the LLM interacts with the formal optimization problem presented (Eq. 2) â€“ whether it generates parameters, guides a solver, or directly outputs the schedule, and how hard constraints are strictly enforced in the latter case. Refining this technical detail would improve clarity further, but overall the proposal is very understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While carbon-aware scheduling and ML applications in this area exist (as shown in the literature review), the specific use of a large language model (LLM) adapted for this complex systems task, integrating heterogeneous data sources (text, numerical time series, structured data) and leveraging its reasoning capabilities for scheduling decisions, represents a novel approach. It distinguishes itself from prior rule-based, optimization-focused, or conventional ML methods by proposing a different paradigm for tackling the complexity. The continual learning aspect applied to an LLM scheduler in this domain further enhances novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in scheduling and LLMs, cites relevant literature, and proposes established techniques for data integration, LLM fine-tuning (supervised, RL), and evaluation. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and rigorous. However, the soundness score is slightly lowered due to the lack of precise technical detail on how the LLM's output translates into a feasible, constraint-satisfying schedule, particularly concerning the interaction with the presented mathematical optimization formulation. Clarifying how the LLM ensures adherence to hard constraints (resource capacity, deadlines, precedence) is needed for full technical soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Accessing diverse, real-time, high-quality data (especially granular datacenter metrics) can be difficult. Training and fine-tuning large LLMs require substantial computational resources and expertise. Integrating the LLM scheduler with real-world cloud orchestrators and ensuring low-latency decision-making at scale are non-trivial engineering tasks. The planned real-world deployment adds another layer of complexity and dependency on infrastructure access. While the phased approach (simulation first) is sensible, the overall project is ambitious and resource-intensive, making its feasibility dependent on significant funding and expert personnel."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of reducing the substantial carbon footprint of cloud computing. The potential to achieve 15-30% greater carbon reduction compared to existing methods, if realized, would have major environmental benefits. Technologically, it pushes the boundaries of applying LLMs to complex systems optimization problems, aligning perfectly with the workshop's theme and potentially establishing a new paradigm. Successful outcomes would provide valuable tools for industry and advance research at the intersection of AI, systems, and sustainability."
