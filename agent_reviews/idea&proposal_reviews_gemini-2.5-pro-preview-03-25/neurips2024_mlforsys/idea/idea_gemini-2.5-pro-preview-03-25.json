        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions on 'Applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization' and provides 'dynamic power management based on workload and carbon predictions' as a specific example. The proposed idea directly addresses this using Reinforcement Learning (an ML technique) for dynamic power management, incorporating both workload and real-time carbon intensity forecasts. It fits squarely within the workshop's scope and special interests."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, core concept (RL for carbon-aware power management), state representation (workload, carbon intensity, SLOs), actions (DVFS, C-states), and reward function (penalizing carbon emissions and SLO violations) are explicitly stated and easy to understand. The distinction between minimizing energy and minimizing carbon footprint is clearly articulated. Minor implementation details are omitted, but the overall research direction is unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using RL for system optimization (including power management) is established, and considering carbon intensity in datacenter operations is an emerging trend, the specific combination proposed here is innovative. Applying RL to dynamically adjust fine-grained power states (DVFS, C-states) based on *real-time* grid carbon intensity forecasts, directly optimizing a carbon-based reward function, offers a fresh perspective compared to solely energy-focused RL or coarser-grained carbon-aware job scheduling. It represents a novel integration of existing concepts for a specific, important problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Key components like RL frameworks, system monitoring tools, power control mechanisms (DVFS/C-states), and carbon intensity forecast APIs (e.g., WattTime, Electricity Maps) are available. However, integrating these components effectively, obtaining accurate real-time carbon data at the required granularity, training a robust RL agent (potentially requiring sophisticated simulation environments to avoid harming hardware or violating SLOs during exploration), and evaluating it realistically pose significant engineering and research effort. Access to suitable hardware testbeds might also be a constraint."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Datacenter energy consumption is a major environmental concern, and its associated carbon footprint is substantial. Directly optimizing for carbon intensity, rather than just energy consumption, addresses the root environmental impact more accurately, especially with the increasing variability of grid carbon intensity due to renewable energy sources. Success in this area could lead to substantial reductions in the actual carbon footprint of computing infrastructure and influence future sustainable computing practices, aligning perfectly with the growing need for carbon-aware systems."
