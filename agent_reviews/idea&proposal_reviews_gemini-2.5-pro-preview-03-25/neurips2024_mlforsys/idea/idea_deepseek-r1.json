        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions on 'Applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization', providing examples like 'energy-aware job scheduling' and 'dynamic power management based on workload and carbon predictions'. This research idea directly addresses this topic by proposing an FRL-based system for dynamic, carbon-aware workload scheduling using real-time carbon intensity data. It also aims to move beyond static heuristics, another point mentioned in the call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (data center carbon emissions), the core problem (static heuristics ignoring real-time carbon intensity), the proposed solution (FRL for dynamic scheduling), the key components (local RL agents, global FRL model, time-series predictions), the objectives (balancing latency, cost, carbon), and the expected impact (15-30% carbon reduction, privacy preservation). The mechanism of shifting workloads based on carbon intensity is easily understood. Minor details about the specific RL algorithms or prediction models could be added, but the core concept is exceptionally clear."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While ML/RL for job scheduling and carbon-aware computing exist as separate research areas, the proposed combination of *Federated* Reinforcement Learning specifically for *dynamic, real-time carbon-aware* scheduling across *distributed* data centers appears innovative. Using FRL addresses the privacy concerns inherent in sharing operational data across sites, which is a significant barrier in practice. This specific synthesis of FRL, real-time carbon data integration, and multi-objective optimization (latency, cost, carbon) for distributed workload scheduling offers a fresh perspective compared to centralized or purely heuristic approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Key enabling factors like real-time carbon intensity data APIs (e.g., WattTime, ElectricityMap) exist. RL and FRL frameworks are available. However, challenges include: 1) Ensuring reliable, low-latency access to accurate carbon intensity data across diverse regions. 2) The complexity of training robust RL agents for multi-objective scheduling in dynamic environments. 3) The practical difficulties of implementing and managing an FRL system across geographically distributed data centers (communication overhead, synchronization, convergence). 4) Integrating the FRL scheduler with existing complex cluster management systems. While ambitious, it builds on existing technologies and seems achievable with significant engineering and research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Data center energy consumption and the associated carbon footprint are substantial and growing environmental concerns. Developing effective strategies to reduce this footprint is critical for sustainable computing. A system achieving a 15-30% reduction in carbon emissions per compute unit, as targeted, would represent a major advancement. Furthermore, by using FRL, the approach addresses privacy concerns, potentially increasing its adoptability by cloud providers managing distributed infrastructure. Success would offer a scalable, data-driven solution to a pressing industry-wide problem."
