        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of applying ML to computer systems problems. Furthermore, it falls squarely into one of the explicitly mentioned areas of interest for the workshop: 'Applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization', specifically mentioning 'energy-aware job scheduling' and 'dynamic power management based on workload and carbon predictions'. The use of RL combined with predictive models (GNN, Transformer) also moves beyond simple heuristic replacement, another point highlighted in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem and the limitations of existing approaches. The main idea concisely describes the proposed framework, including the specific ML models (GNN, Transformer, RL/PPO) and their respective roles (job prediction, carbon/price forecasting, scheduling). The evaluation plan (platform, data, benchmarks) and expected outcomes are also clearly stated. While specific implementation details (e.g., exact RL state/action space) are omitted for brevity, the overall concept and approach are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While RL for scheduling, GNNs for system predictions, and Transformers for time-series forecasting exist individually, their proposed integration is novel. Specifically, combining a GNN for job structure/resource prediction, a Transformer for real-time carbon intensity and price forecasting, and an RL agent (PPO) for dynamic, multi-objective (energy, carbon, SLOs) scheduling and workload migration represents a sophisticated and fresh approach. It advances beyond simpler predictive models or RL formulations often seen in this domain by incorporating both workload characteristics and dynamic external environmental factors (carbon intensity)."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods, but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core ML components (GNNs, Transformers, PPO) are well-established. Public datasets (like Google Cluster Data) and APIs for carbon intensity/electricity prices exist. Kubernetes is a suitable and accessible evaluation platform. However, integrating these diverse components into a cohesive system, training the RL agent effectively within a complex, potentially simulated environment, ensuring the predictive models are accurate and performant enough for real-time decision-making, and achieving the ambitious 20-30% reduction target will require significant engineering effort and expertise in both ML and systems."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and growing problem of energy consumption and carbon footprint in data centers, which has major environmental and economic implications. Developing intelligent scheduling systems that co-optimize energy, cost, carbon emissions, and performance (SLOs) is crucial for sustainable computing. Success in this research could lead to substantial reductions in operational costs and environmental impact for cloud providers and large computing facilities, representing a major advancement in green computing and aligning well with global sustainability goals."
