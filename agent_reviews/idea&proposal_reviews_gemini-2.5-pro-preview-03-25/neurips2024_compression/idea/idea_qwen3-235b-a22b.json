        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses several key topics: 'Improvements in learning-based techniques for compressing data' (by proposing a new deep learning compression framework), 'Theoretical understanding of neural compression methods, including... perceptual/realism metrics' (by focusing on learned perceptual metrics and aiming for theoretical insights), and 'Integrating information-theoretic principles' (by grounding the perceptual metric in information theory). The focus on balancing compression efficiency (rate) with perceptual fidelity using machine learning methods fits squarely within the workshop's scope of intersecting ML, compression, and information theory."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem of perceptual fidelity in learned compression. The main idea is well-defined, specifying the core proposal (integrating a learnable neural perceptual metric into RDO), the objective function ( \\\\min \\\\text{Rate} + \\\\lambda \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\text{perceptual}} ), the source of the metric (pre-trained vision transformer), the optimization strategy (adaptive Lagrange multipliers), the inclusion of a complexity regularizer, the planned empirical validation (datasets, baselines, metrics), and the theoretical goals (connections to EMD, perceptual manifolds). It is concise and leaves little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While learned compression and the use of perceptual loss functions (like LPIPS) are established areas, the core proposal of *learning* the perceptual distortion metric *jointly* with the compressor within an adaptive RDO framework, potentially derived from information-theoretic principles and leveraging large pre-trained models like vision transformers, offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond fixed perceptual metrics towards adaptive, learned ones integrated directly into the optimization. The proposed theoretical investigation connecting neural compression, EMD, and perceptual manifolds also adds a novel dimension. It's more of an innovative integration and refinement of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. It relies on established deep learning techniques for building compression models and perceptual metrics. Training neural networks, using pre-trained models (like Vision Transformers), and implementing RDO loops are common practices in the field. Public datasets (KITTI, Kinetics) and standard perceptual metrics (LPIPS, DISTS) are available for evaluation. While jointly training the compressor and the adaptive perceptual metric, along with managing the adaptive lambda, will be computationally intensive and potentially complex to stabilize, it does not require fundamentally new technology or unavailable resources. The theoretical component might be challenging but the empirical part is well within the scope of current ML research capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Achieving better perceptual quality at lower bitrates is a critical, unsolved challenge in data compression, especially for images and videos where human perception is the ultimate judge. Standard metrics like PSNR/SSIM often fail to capture perceptual realism. Developing a framework that explicitly optimizes for learned, potentially more accurate, perceptual metrics could lead to substantial improvements in user experience for applications like video streaming, virtual reality, and image sharing. Furthermore, providing theoretical insights into the relationship between rate, distortion (as measured perceptually), and information theory would be a valuable contribution to the field."
