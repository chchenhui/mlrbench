    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of learned compression, distributed settings, theoretical understanding, and information-theoretic principles. It meticulously expands on the core research idea (MI-regularized VAEs for DSC). Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, citing relevant prior art (Ozyilkan'23, Mital'22, Whang'21) as context and baselines, and explicitly aims to tackle the identified challenges like modeling complex correlations and providing theoretical grounding for neural DSC. The proposed methodology directly reflects the integration of ML (VAEs) and information theory (MI regularization) for distributed compression."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the proposed MI-RegDSC framework, including the VAE architecture, the precise loss function with its components (reconstruction, KL rate, MI regularization), potential MI estimators, training procedures, and a comprehensive experimental plan. The rationale and significance are well-articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow. While minor implementation details (e.g., exact network architectures) are naturally omitted, the overall concept and plan are presented with very high clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While VAEs are standard for compression and MI estimation/regularization is explored in ML, the core novelty lies in the specific application and formulation: explicitly maximizing mutual information between the *continuous latent representations* generated by *distributed encoders* as a primary mechanism for exploiting source correlation in a general DSC setting (beyond just Wyner-Ziv). This contrasts with prior neural DSC works focusing on decoder-side information (Mital et al.), discrete latent codes via VQ-VAE (Whang et al.), or learned binning (Ozyilkan et al.). The proposal aims to leverage continuous latent spaces coordinated via MI, which represents a fresh perspective compared to the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations of VAEs for rate-distortion trade-offs and information theory (MI). The proposed loss function is mathematically well-defined and combines standard terms (reconstruction, KL divergence) with the novel MI regularization term. The plan to use established neural MI estimators (MINE, InfoNCE) is appropriate. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant baselines (independent coding, decoder fusion, SOTA neural DSC), standard metrics (R-D curves, PSNR, SSIM, MSE), and ablation studies. Potential challenges, such as the difficulty of accurate high-dimensional MI estimation, are acknowledged. The theoretical analysis plan connecting the loss terms to DSC principles is sound, although deriving tight bounds might be challenging."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard deep learning frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow), common hardware (GPUs), and accessible benchmark datasets. The core components (VAEs, MI estimators) have existing implementations or are well-understood. While integrating and training the complete system with the composite loss function (balancing reconstruction, rate, and MI terms across multiple sources) will require careful engineering and hyperparameter tuning, it does not necessitate breakthroughs in fundamental technology. The main risks involve the stability/accuracy of MI estimation and potentially complex training dynamics, but these are typical research challenges rather than insurmountable obstacles. The proposed plan and scope appear realistic for a dedicated research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: efficient compression of correlated data in distributed systems, which is crucial for applications like Federated Learning, IoT networks, and multi-camera systems. By proposing a novel method potentially capable of better handling complex, non-linear correlations in continuous data compared to classical methods or existing neural approaches relying on discretization, the research has high potential impact. Success would not only lead to practical improvements in compression efficiency but also contribute valuable theoretical insights into the connection between information theory (MI) and deep learning objectives in the context of distributed systems. It directly aligns with the workshop's goal of catalyzing scalable, efficient information-processing systems."
