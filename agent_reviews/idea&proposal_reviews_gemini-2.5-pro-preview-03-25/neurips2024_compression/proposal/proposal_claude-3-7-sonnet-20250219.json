        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the intersection of ML, compression, and information theory, specifically targeting distributed compression and theoretical understanding. The methodology clearly builds upon the research idea (MI-regularized neural framework) and positions itself within the context of the provided literature, aiming to tackle identified challenges like modeling complex correlations and providing theoretical grounding. It comprehensively covers the requirements and shows a deep understanding of the context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the stage effectively, the methodology section meticulously details the architecture, loss function (including MI regularization via InfoNCE), training/encoding/decoding protocol, and theoretical analysis goals. The experimental design is thorough, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing concepts like VAEs for compression and MI estimation (InfoNCE), the core idea of explicitly regularizing the latent codes of independently encoded distributed sources to maximize their mutual information within a VAE framework appears novel in the context of distributed source coding. This differs from prior work focusing primarily on side-information-based decoding (Wyner-Ziv) or implicit correlation modeling. The proposed theoretical analysis connecting this specific MI regularization to classical bounds also contributes to its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages well-established techniques like VAEs and InfoNCE. The proposed multi-objective loss function combining rate, distortion, and mutual information is theoretically motivated. The plan for theoretical analysis connecting the approach to Slepian-Wolf/Wyner-Ziv bounds is appropriate. The experimental design is robust. Minor weaknesses include the potential complexity of optimizing the multi-objective loss and the reliance on the effectiveness of the InfoNCE estimator in this specific compression context, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard deep learning components (VAEs, NNs) and publicly available datasets. The required computational resources are typical for deep learning research. While implementing and tuning the multi-objective optimization might require significant effort, and the theoretical analysis could be challenging, there are no fundamental roadblocks suggesting impracticability. The plan is realistic with manageable risks associated with research execution."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical and timely problem of efficient distributed compression for correlated data, relevant to numerous applications (IoT, federated learning, multi-sensor systems). By aiming to bridge neural compression techniques with information-theoretic principles (Slepian-Wolf bounds) and potentially outperforming existing methods on complex data, the research has the potential for substantial impact. It aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of advancing scalable, efficient information-processing systems."
