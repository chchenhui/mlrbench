        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for new architectures, algorithms, and empirical studies for ICL by proposing the CICL framework. It thoroughly elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the cross-example attention, contrastive pretraining, and example selection components. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, citing relevant papers on contrastive ICL, example selection, and cross-example attention, and explicitly aims to address key challenges identified in the review, such as modeling inter-example relationships and improving robustness to example quality."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and outlines the proposed solution (CICL) and its objectives. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the architecture, pretraining strategy, and inference-time selection algorithm, including formal mathematical notations for key components like the cross-example attention and contrastive loss. The experimental design is comprehensive and unambiguous, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Expected outcomes and impact are also clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the proposal immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like contrastive learning for ICL (Peng et al., Mo et al., Johnson et al.), cross-example attention (Gonzalez et al.), and example selection (Ye et al.) have been explored, the proposal's novelty lies in their specific synergistic integration. Particularly novel aspects include: (1) the self-supervised contrastive pretraining explicitly designed to learn *relationship embeddings* (R_{i,j}) between examples, and (2) the use of these explicit relationship embeddings alongside enhanced example representations within the decoder for prediction. This focus on modeling and utilizing inter-example relationships contrasts with prior work that might use contrastive methods at decoding time or for example selection optimization. It's not entirely groundbreaking, but offers a fresh perspective and combination."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations like transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and contrastive learning principles. The proposed methodology, including the cross-example attention mechanism, the contrastive pretraining objective (InfoNCE-like), and the greedy example selection, is technically plausible and well-justified. The mathematical formulations are generally clear and appear correct, although specific implementation details of modules like `RelationEncoder` and the final `Decoder` integration are high-level, which is acceptable for a proposal. The comprehensive experimental design with diverse tasks, strong baselines, ablation studies, and clear metrics further supports the methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical complexity and resource requirements. Implementing the cross-example attention, relationship encoder, and integrating the contrastive objectives into large model pretraining requires substantial engineering effort. The specified pretraining (T5-base/large on C4 with 8 A100 GPUs for 100k steps) is resource-intensive but standard for this scale of research. The evaluation plan across multiple domains is also demanding. While technically achievable with current methods and sufficient resources, the ambitious scope carries moderate implementation risks related to tuning, scaling, and integration complexity. The plan is generally realistic, assuming access to the stated computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant and timely problem in ICL: the inefficient use of context examples and the need for better generalization, especially in low-data or noisy scenarios. By aiming to explicitly model inter-example relationships, the research has the potential to lead to meaningful improvements in ICL performance, sample efficiency, and robustness. Success could provide valuable theoretical insights into how large models learn from context and offer practical benefits like reduced data requirements and computational costs (via fewer examples). The potential impact on making advanced AI more accessible and effective in resource-constrained settings is substantial."
