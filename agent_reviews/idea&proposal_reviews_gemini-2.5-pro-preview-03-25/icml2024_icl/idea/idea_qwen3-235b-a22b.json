    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (ICL 2024 workshop call for papers). It directly addresses one of the explicitly listed topics of interest: 'the relationship between ICL and few-shot learning, meta-learning and automated machine learning (AutoML)'. Furthermore, it proposes a new framework ('MetaPrompter') involving ICL, discusses empirical evaluation, and touches upon improving ICL performance in dynamic settings, all of which fall squarely within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, core components (ICL inference, RL meta-controller, dynamic prompt updates), and overall goal (continual in-context learning) are clearly presented. The proposed method, MetaPrompter, is described conceptually. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details of the RL meta-controller (state/action space, reward function) and the precise nature of the task metadata analysis, but the fundamental concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While research exists at the intersection of ICL, meta-learning, and AutoML, the proposed approach of using a reinforcement learning meta-controller to *dynamically* adapt prompt templates and task representations based on ongoing ICL performance feedback is innovative. Framing this as 'continual in-context learning' and explicitly bridging the gap between ICL's immediacy and AutoML's optimization offers a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible with current technology. It relies on accessible components like pre-trained LLMs and standard RL algorithms. Defining reward signals from ICL performance is practical. The main challenges likely lie in the computational cost of training the RL meta-controller, which might require significant interaction with the LLM, and potentially the complexity of designing an effective action space for prompt optimization. However, these challenges seem surmountable within a research setting, making the idea generally implementable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. It tackles the important challenge of enabling models to adapt quickly (like ICL) while also improving strategy over time (like AutoML), which is crucial for real-world dynamic environments. Success could lead to more robust, efficient, and autonomous AI systems requiring less manual intervention for prompt engineering or retraining, advancing the practical applicability of ICL, particularly in volatile domains like robotics or real-time diagnostics."
