        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea aligns perfectly with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics mentioned in the workshop call: 'Representation learning for perception, prediction', 'Approaches that account for interactions between traditional sub-components (e.g., joint perception and prediction)', 'intermediate representations', and 'ML / statistical learning approaches to facilitate safety / interpretability'. The focus on interpretable interaction representations within a joint perception and prediction framework fits squarely within the workshop's scope of promoting ML research with real-world impact for self-driving technology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (black-box nature of current models, need for interpretable interactions) is well-defined. The core proposal (learning an explicit, interpretable interaction representation using GNNs/attention) is understandable. The expected outcomes (improved accuracy and interpretability) are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanism for ensuring and validating interpretability (e.g., how 'interaction strength or type' will be quantitatively mapped and verified), but the overall concept is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While joint perception and prediction, GNNs, and attention for interactions are existing research areas, the specific focus on designing an *explicit intermediate representation* primarily for *interpretable interactions* is a fresh perspective. Many works aim for interpretability as a byproduct, but this idea centers on creating a dedicated, interpretable interaction module. It combines existing concepts in a novel way to tackle the interpretability challenge in complex driving scenarios, moving beyond simply applying attention mechanisms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It proposes using established techniques like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms, which are well-understood and have available implementations. Datasets suitable for training joint perception and prediction models exist (e.g., Waymo, nuScenes). The main challenge lies in designing the representation to be genuinely interpretable and validating this interpretability, which might require careful architectural choices and potentially user studies or correlation analyses, but it does not rely on unavailable technology or unrealistic resources. Standard deep learning infrastructure would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Interpretability and safety are paramount concerns for autonomous driving systems. Addressing the black-box nature of complex models, especially concerning agent interactions which are critical for safety, is a major challenge. Successfully developing an interpretable interaction representation could significantly enhance model trustworthiness, facilitate debugging, improve safety verification, and potentially lead to more robust prediction performance by explicitly modeling crucial interaction dynamics. This directly contributes to the real-world viability of autonomous driving."
