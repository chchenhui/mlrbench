    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned for the workshop: 'Representation learning for perception, prediction, planning', 'integration strategies' through multi-modal fusion, and 'ML / statistical learning approaches to facilitate safety / interpretability'. The focus on a unified scene representation framework aligns perfectly with the workshop's theme of intermediate representations and integration in autonomous driving."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It outlines a specific motivation, a three-component framework (Sensor Fusion, Contextual Embedding, Interpretability/Safety), and the expected outcomes. The technologies mentioned (DNNs, attention, transformers, XAI) provide a good level of detail. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise architectural details within each module and the exact mechanisms for integrating safety constraints, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While multi-modal fusion, attention mechanisms, transformers for context, and XAI for interpretability are all established concepts in autonomous driving research, the proposed integration of these specific components into a single, unified scene representation framework offers some originality. The explicit inclusion of an interpretability and safety module integrated within the representation framework is a relevant contribution, though not entirely groundbreaking. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and integration rather than fundamentally new techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It relies on existing deep learning techniques and architectures. Multi-modal datasets for autonomous driving are available (e.g., nuScenes, Waymo). The required computational resources are significant but standard for deep learning research in this domain. Key challenges would involve the effective integration of the three modules, careful tuning of the attention and transformer components, and rigorous validation of the interpretability and safety aspects, but these are engineering and research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Robust scene understanding through effective multi-modal fusion is a critical bottleneck for safe and reliable autonomous driving. Addressing perception, prediction, and planning through a unified representation, while explicitly incorporating interpretability and safety, tackles core challenges in the field. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in the trustworthiness and performance of autonomous systems, aligning well with the workshop's goal of promoting real-world impact."
