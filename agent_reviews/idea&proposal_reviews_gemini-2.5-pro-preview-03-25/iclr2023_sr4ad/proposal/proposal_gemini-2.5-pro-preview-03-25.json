    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of representation learning, interaction modeling, joint perception-prediction, and generalization/safety. The proposed Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph (HSG) directly embodies the research idea. The introduction and methodology explicitly build upon and aim to address the challenges identified in the literature review (e.g., integrating static/dynamic elements, limitations of modularity, need for better interaction modeling as seen in Trajectron++, HDGT, VAD comparisons). All sections consistently reinforce the core concept and its relevance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from motivation and background to the specific methodology and expected outcomes. Key concepts like HSG, node/edge types, joint learning, and self-supervision are explained well, particularly in the methodology section. The objectives are specific and measurable. Minor areas could be slightly more concrete, such as the precise implementation details of the hierarchical structure (though spatial focus is stated) and the exact GNN/temporal model variants, but overall the proposal is highly understandable and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by synthesizing several concepts into a novel framework (HSG) for AD. While components like GNNs, attention, temporal models, joint learning, and self-supervision exist, their specific combination into a *hierarchical* spatiotemporal graph integrating static map elements and dynamic agents for *joint* perception refinement and prediction, enhanced by *contrastive* self-supervision, represents a distinct and innovative approach. It clearly differentiates itself from purely occupancy-based (UniScene), vectorized (VAD), or prediction-focused graph methods (HDGT, Trajectron++) by aiming for a more integrated and structured representation facilitating joint tasks and generalization."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in graph neural networks (GAT), temporal sequence modeling (RNNs/TCNs), attention mechanisms, and self-supervised contrastive learning (InfoNCE). The methodology is well-defined, outlining data processing, graph construction, model architecture (HSG-Net), loss functions, and a comprehensive evaluation plan. Technical formulations (e.g., attention calculation) are correctly presented. The approach is well-justified by the limitations of existing methods discussed in the introduction and literature review. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and ablation studies to validate the core claims."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It relies on standard datasets (nuScenes, WOD, Argoverse 2) and established ML techniques with available libraries. However, constructing and processing large, dynamic, hierarchical graphs at each timestep is computationally intensive. Training the complex HSG-Net model, especially with joint objectives and self-supervision, will require substantial computational resources (GPU clusters) and careful engineering. The hierarchical aspect adds complexity that needs careful design and tuning. While achievable with sufficient resources and expertise, the complexity and potential computational bottlenecks make it ambitious, warranting a 'Good' rather than 'Excellent' score."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in current AD systems, namely the fragmentation of perception and prediction, inadequate modeling of complex interactions, and challenges in generalization. By proposing a unified, interaction-aware representation (HSG) and leveraging joint learning and self-supervision, the research has the potential to lead to major advancements in the accuracy, robustness, and safety of AD systems. Improved scene understanding and prediction, especially in complex scenarios, directly contribute to safer planning and decision-making. The work also holds academic significance by advancing representation learning for dynamic multi-agent systems."
