        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for integrated representations, joint perception/prediction, and methods enhancing generalization and safety. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core research idea (hierarchical spatiotemporal graph, DGNNs, TCNs, self-supervision). It also positions itself well relative to the cited literature, aiming to tackle identified challenges like integrating static/dynamic elements and improving generalization, building upon existing graph-based approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, outlining the background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes logically. The core concepts (hierarchical graph, DGNNs, TCNs, self-supervised learning) are introduced. However, some technical details lack precision. For instance, the mechanism for 'adaptive edge weights', the specific structure of the 'multiple layers' in the hierarchy, the exact DGNN architecture, and the specifics of the contrastive learning task could be defined more clearly. Additionally, the use of 'mAP' for trajectory prediction accuracy is unconventional (ADE/FDE are standard) and requires clarification or justification."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality. While individual components like GNNs, TCNs, and self-supervised learning are established, their combination within a *hierarchical* spatiotemporal graph framework designed to *unify* static and dynamic scene elements for *joint* perception, scene flow, and prediction in autonomous driving appears innovative. It distinguishes itself from existing unified representations (often occupancy/vector-based) and standard graph-based trajectory predictors (often focused solely on dynamic agents or using flatter graph structures). The hierarchical aspect combined with DGNNs for adaptive topology learning is a key novel contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, built upon established principles (graph representations for interactions, temporal modeling, self-supervised learning). The choice of DGNNs and TCNs is appropriate for the described tasks. The methodology addresses key challenges identified in the literature. However, the lack of specific technical formulations (e.g., mathematical definitions of the graph structure, adaptive weights, or loss functions) prevents a higher score. The methodology is described conceptually, but rigor would be enhanced by more concrete details. The evaluation plan is mostly standard, although the mAP metric for trajectory prediction raises a minor question about standard practice or clarity."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires large-scale, multi-modal annotated datasets (potentially available, e.g., nuScenes, Waymo, but annotation for interactions can be complex). Training hierarchical DGNNs on large, dynamic graphs is computationally intensive, requiring substantial GPU resources. Integrating multi-modal data and implementing the adaptive graph structure effectively demands considerable ML engineering expertise. Scalability to dense urban scenes and achieving real-time inference performance are potential hurdles that need careful consideration. While achievable in a well-resourced research setting, it's an ambitious undertaking with notable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in autonomous driving: the lack of unified scene representations that effectively integrate static and dynamic elements for robust perception and prediction. Success would represent a major advancement over fragmented, modular approaches, potentially leading to improved accuracy in complex scenarios, better handling of interactions, enhanced robustness to edge cases, and safer planning. The research directly contributes to core goals in AV development and aligns perfectly with the workshop's themes, promising substantial impact."
