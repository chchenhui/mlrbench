    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core need for integrated scene representations in autonomous driving, as highlighted in the task description. The proposed Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Graph (HSG) framework directly implements the research idea by unifying static and dynamic elements. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself relative to the cited literature (UniScene, VAD, HDGT, etc.), acknowledging prior work while clearly articulating its unique contribution (hierarchical structure integrating infrastructure and agents). It also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as static/dynamic integration and generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the HSG structure, the DGNN architecture (including specific layers like GCN, attention, TCN, and edge updates), data integration, joint task learning, and the experimental setup. Mathematical formulations are included for key components. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature and implementation of the 'Interaction level' nodes and the exact mechanisms for cross-hierarchy information flow, but the overall concept and approach are understandable. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While graph-based representations and GNNs are used in the literature (HDGT, STGAT, Social-STGCNN), the core novelty lies in the proposed *hierarchical* structure that explicitly integrates *both* static infrastructure elements and dynamic agents within a *single* unified spatiotemporal graph. Most prior graph methods focus primarily on agent-agent interactions. The combination of this specific hierarchical structure with dynamic graph updates, temporal modeling (TCNs), and self-supervised contrastive learning tailored for this representation constitutes a fresh approach to unified scene understanding in autonomous driving. The distinction from occupancy (UniScene) and purely vectorized (VAD) methods is clear."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (Graph Neural Networks, Temporal Convolutional Networks, Attention Mechanisms, Multi-Task Learning, Contrastive Learning). The proposed methodology, including the HSG definition, DGNN architecture, loss formulations, and contrastive learning setup, appears technically coherent and well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant datasets, metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. Technical formulations are provided and seem generally correct, though full validation requires implementation. A minor gap is the lack of explicit discussion on how scalability challenges, inherent in large dynamic graphs, will be specifically mitigated beyond standard GNN techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The required technologies (GNNs, TCNs, deep learning frameworks) are available. Standard datasets (nuScenes, Waymo, Argoverse) are suitable. However, constructing the complex HSG dynamically from multi-modal sensor data, implementing the hierarchical DGNN, tuning the multi-task and contrastive learning objectives, and managing the computational cost (requiring substantial GPU resources like 8 A100s) will demand considerable engineering effort and expertise. Scalability in dense, complex scenes remains a practical concern that could affect real-time performance, although offline analysis and research are clearly feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in autonomous driving: the lack of unified scene representations that seamlessly integrate perception, prediction, and reasoning about interactions between static and dynamic elements. Success would represent a major advancement over fragmented modular systems and potentially improve prediction accuracy, robustness, generalization, and interpretability. The potential to influence future autonomous driving system architectures towards more integrated designs is substantial. Explicitly modeling infrastructure-agent interactions could directly contribute to safety improvements."
