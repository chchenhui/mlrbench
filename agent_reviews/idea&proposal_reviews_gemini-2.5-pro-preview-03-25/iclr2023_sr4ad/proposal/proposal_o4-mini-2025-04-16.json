    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for integrated scene representations, interaction modeling, and improvements in safety/interpretability/generalization. It fully embodies the research idea of using a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph (HSTG) for unified representation. Furthermore, it positions itself effectively within the provided literature, citing relevant works (UniScene, VAD, HDGT) and explicitly aiming to tackle the key challenges identified (static/dynamic integration, scalability, data fusion, generalization, safety)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. Objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology section provides substantial detail on graph construction, node/edge features, the GNN architecture (GAT, TCN), self-supervised learning, and joint training, including mathematical formulations and implementation specifics. The experimental design is thorough, outlining datasets, metrics, baselines, ablations, and robustness checks. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities might exist in the exact mechanism for perception-prediction feedback beyond joint loss optimization, but these do not detract significantly from the overall excellent clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using graphs for autonomous driving scene understanding and prediction is not new (as shown in the literature review with HDGT, STGAT, etc.), the specific proposal of a *hierarchical* spatiotemporal graph unifying static map elements and dynamic agents, combined with GAT+TCN architecture and *self-supervised contrastive pre-training* for joint optimization of perception, scene flow, *and* trajectory prediction, represents a novel synthesis and extension of existing ideas. It clearly differentiates itself from cited works like UniScene (occupancy-centric), VAD (vectorized planning focus), and HDGT (heterogeneous graph for prediction)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in graph neural networks (GAT), temporal modeling (TCN), and self-supervised learning (contrastive loss). The methodology is well-justified, technically detailed, and logically structured. The mathematical formulations provided are standard and appear correct. The approach of integrating static and dynamic information in a graph is well-motivated for capturing interactions. The reliance on initial detections is acknowledged implicitly, but the joint learning framework aims to mitigate this. The overall technical approach is robust and well-grounded in ML principles."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages standard, publicly available datasets and established ML techniques (GNNs, TCNs, contrastive learning). The required computational resources (8x A100 GPUs) are significant but standard for this scale of research. The main challenges lie in the engineering complexity of implementing the full HSTG system, efficiently handling large dynamic graphs, and ensuring convergence of the multi-task, self-supervised training objective. The 12-month timeline is ambitious but potentially achievable for a dedicated team. Overall, the plan is realistic within a well-resourced research environment, with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in autonomous driving: the lack of unified scene representations that effectively model interactions between static infrastructure and dynamic agents. Success would likely lead to substantial improvements in perception accuracy, prediction performance (especially long-term), robustness, and potentially safety and interpretability, as argued in the proposal. The expected outcomes (e.g., 10-15% ADE/FDE reduction) indicate a high potential impact. The HSTG framework could serve as a valuable contribution to both academic research and industrial AD development."
