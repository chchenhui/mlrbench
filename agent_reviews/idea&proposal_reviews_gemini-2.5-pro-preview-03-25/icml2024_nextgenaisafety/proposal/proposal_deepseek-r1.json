    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (specifically addressing 'Dangerous Capabilities'), the research idea (elaborating on the Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filter concept), and the literature review (incorporating RLHF, risk-awareness, and addressing challenges like balancing safety/utility and adaptation). It directly tackles the core problem outlined in the task and builds logically upon the provided idea and relevant research."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, the methodology is broken down into logical, understandable stages (Data Collection, Risk Classification, Policy Enforcement, RLHF, Evaluation), and the rationale is compelling. Technical details like the classifier formulation, loss function, and RLHF objective are included, enhancing clarity. The structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While components like risk classification and RLHF exist, the integration into a proactive, two-stage filter with dynamic, risk-level-dependent policies (proceed, safe-completion, refuse) tuned via RLHF specifically for dangerous capabilities is innovative. It moves beyond static blocklists or purely post-hoc alignment methods discussed in the background and literature, offering a fresh approach to balancing safety and utility in this specific context."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It leverages well-established techniques (transformer classifiers, focal loss, adversarial training, RLHF with PPO) and grounds them in relevant recent literature (Safe RLHF, RA-PbRL). The methodology is logically structured, addressing potential issues like class imbalance (focal loss) and robustness (adversarial training). The technical formulations provided are standard and appear correct. The overall approach is methodologically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. Training the models (classifier, RLHF) and implementing the filter are technically achievable with standard ML resources. However, curating a comprehensive, high-quality threat taxonomy and obtaining sufficient, reliable human feedback for RLHF will be resource-intensive and require significant domain expertise. Simulating realistic user queries and evaluating effectively, especially with real-world data, adds complexity. While achievable within a well-resourced research setting, these data and annotation requirements lower the feasibility score slightly compared to other dimensions."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem in AI safety â€“ preventing the misuse of AI for generating dangerous knowledge, as highlighted in the task description. Successfully developing DRAF would represent a major advancement over current static or overly restrictive methods, potentially offering a much-needed balance between safety and utility. The potential impact on AI safety practices, deployment standards, and responsible AI development is substantial."
