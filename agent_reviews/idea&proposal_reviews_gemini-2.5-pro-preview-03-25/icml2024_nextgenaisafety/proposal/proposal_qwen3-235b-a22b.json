        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description's focus on 'Dangerous Capabilities', the core research idea of a two-stage adaptive filter, and the cited literature review. It directly addresses the need to prevent misuse while allowing beneficial research, as outlined in the task. The methodology explicitly builds upon concepts like Safe RLHF and risk-aware RL mentioned in the literature. The objectives and evaluation plan are tightly coupled with the problem statement and the proposed solution."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The two-stage approach, objectives, methodology components (classifier architecture, RL framework, reward function), and evaluation plan are articulated well. Technical details like the loss function and risk score calculation are provided. Minor ambiguities exist around the exact implementation of 'safe completion templates', the 'expert redirect' mechanism, and the precise logistics of the large-scale human feedback collection, but the overall structure and core concepts are easily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal shows notable originality. While building on existing work (RLHF, risk-aware RL, transformer models), the specific combination of a pre-trained, adversarially-augmented risk classifier (DeBERTa) feeding into a risk-aware RLHF system (PPO with CVaR-based dynamic thresholds adapted from RA-PbRL) for this specific task is innovative. The focus on a multi-level response (approve/template/refuse) tailored to dangerous capabilities, along with the planned creation and release of specific benchmark datasets (DANGER-500K, REDTEAM-30K), constitutes a strong novel contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established techniques like fine-tuning large language models (DeBERTa), standard RL algorithms (PPO), and concepts from recent AI safety literature (Safe RLHF, RA-PbRL, CVaR). The methodology includes good practices like adversarial data augmentation and focal loss for the classifier, and a comprehensive (though complex) reward function for the RL agent. The evaluation plan with relevant metrics, ablations, and baselines is robust. Minor concerns exist regarding the potential complexity of tuning the multi-component reward function and ensuring the classifier's risk score accurately reflects real-world risk."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily related to data and human feedback. Curating/generating the large, specialized datasets (500K annotated, 500K synthetic, 30K red-team) requires substantial effort. The plan to involve 100 domain experts and gather feedback from 10K user trials is highly ambitious and resource-intensive, potentially posing logistical bottlenecks. While the core ML techniques (fine-tuning, PPO) are feasible with adequate compute, the scale of data curation and human-in-the-loop components makes the overall plan challenging but not impossible for a well-resourced team."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses a critical AI safety challenge ('Dangerous Capabilities') with broad societal implications. Successfully developing a system that dynamically balances safety and utility for potentially harmful queries would be a major advancement over static filters. The potential impacts include enabling safer AI deployment, informing policy/regulation, facilitating safer research access in sensitive domains, and contributing valuable benchmark datasets to the research community."
