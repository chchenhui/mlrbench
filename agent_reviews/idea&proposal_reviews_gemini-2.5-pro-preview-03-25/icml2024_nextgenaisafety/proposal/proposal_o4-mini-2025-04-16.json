    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (specifically addressing point 5 on 'Dangerous Capabilities'), the research idea (elaborating on the dynamic risk-adaptive filter concept), and the literature review (incorporating concepts like Safe RLHF and CVaR). It directly tackles the challenge of preventing misuse of LLMs for dangerous knowledge dissemination while allowing beneficial research, as outlined in the task. The methodology builds directly upon the core concepts presented in the research idea and leverages recent advancements cited in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology is broken down logically into stages (Risk Classifier, Policy Engine) with detailed explanations of dataset construction, model architectures, loss functions, RLHF formulation (including CVaR), the full pipeline, and experimental design. Mathematical notations are used appropriately and explained. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While components like risk classification and RLHF for safety exist, the specific combination of a *continuous* risk score feeding into a *dynamically adjusted*, *risk-constrained* (Safe RLHF + CVaR) policy engine for filtering dangerous queries represents a significant advancement over static blocking or simpler rule-based systems. The integration of CVaR for tail-risk mitigation in this specific application context adds further novelty. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by proposing a more nuanced, adaptive, and statistically grounded filtering mechanism."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in NLP (Transformers) and RL (RLHF, constrained optimization, CVaR), citing relevant state-of-the-art research (Dai et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). The methodology is robust, with well-justified choices for model architectures, loss functions (including a ranking component), and the constrained RLHF objective. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Technical formulations are correct and clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The primary hurdles are the significant effort required for curating and labeling the large-scale 'DangerQA' dataset (15K queries + 5K adversarial) involving domain experts, and the complexity of implementing and tuning the constrained RLHF system, particularly with CVaR constraints. Access to substantial compute resources (8 A100 GPUs mentioned) is necessary. While the techniques are known, integrating them effectively and achieving stable training requires significant expertise. The plan is realistic for a well-resourced research team, but the data and tuning aspects introduce moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and pressing AI safety problem: mitigating the risk of LLMs generating harmful content related to dangerous capabilities. Success would provide a much-needed alternative to overly restrictive or easily bypassed static filters, potentially enabling safer deployment of powerful AI models. The work could lead to major advancements in AI safety engineering, influence industry best practices, and preserve access for legitimate research, thus having substantial positive impact."
