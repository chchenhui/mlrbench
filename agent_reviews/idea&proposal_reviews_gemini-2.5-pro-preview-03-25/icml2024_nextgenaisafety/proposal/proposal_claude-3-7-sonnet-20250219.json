    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Dangerous Capabilities' challenge outlined in the task, focusing on preventing misuse while allowing beneficial research. The core methodology (Dynamic Risk-Adaptive Filtering, continuous risk score, graduated response, RLHF) perfectly matches the research idea. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as balancing helpfulness/harmlessness (Safe RLHF), risk-aware decision making, integrating human feedback, and adapting to threats. The objectives and methodology are tightly coupled and directly respond to the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section breaks down the framework into understandable components (Risk Assessment, Response Policy, RLHF, Evaluation) with sufficient technical detail, including formulas and process descriptions (e.g., graduated response levels, RLHF loop). The evaluation plan is comprehensive and clearly articulated. While highly technical, the language is precise and largely unambiguous, making the proposal easy to follow for an expert audience."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing concepts like risk classification, RLHF, and context awareness, the specific combination and application are innovative. The core novelty lies in moving beyond binary filtering to a *continuous* risk assessment coupled with *graduated* response strategies, dynamically adapted via RLHF specifically for mitigating dangerous knowledge dissemination. This contrasts with simpler allow/block mechanisms or standard RLHF applications focused solely on helpfulness/harmlessness alignment. The proposed framework offers a fresh perspective on balancing safety and utility in this critical domain."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established machine learning techniques (neural classification, PPO for RL, RLHF). The methodology is well-reasoned, including steps like expert-driven taxonomy development, diverse dataset creation (including adversarial examples), contextual factor integration, and a multi-objective reward function for RLHF. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, featuring relevant metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. Minor points, such as the specific mathematical formulation for combining base risk and context (`Base * Context`), might require further empirical validation or theoretical justification compared to alternatives, but the overall technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges requiring substantial resources. Key hurdles include: 1) Developing a comprehensive and accurate risk taxonomy across diverse domains, requiring extensive domain expert collaboration. 2) Creating large-scale, high-quality datasets, especially the nuanced 'BoundaryQuery' and 'AdversarialQuery' sets. 3) Implementing and managing a complex, multi-stakeholder human feedback loop (safety experts, educational experts, users). 4) Integrating and evaluating the system effectively within a large AI model. While technically achievable using current methods, the scale of data collection, expert involvement, and system integration makes it ambitious and resource-intensive."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and increasingly critical problem in AI safety â€“ preventing the misuse of powerful AI models for generating or disseminating dangerous knowledge. Successfully developing a dynamic, adaptive filter that balances safety with utility would be a major advancement over current static or binary approaches. The potential impact is substantial, offering practical tools for AI developers, enabling safer deployment in sensitive areas, informing policy, and potentially mitigating real-world harm. The creation of a standardized benchmark dataset would also be a valuable contribution to the field."
