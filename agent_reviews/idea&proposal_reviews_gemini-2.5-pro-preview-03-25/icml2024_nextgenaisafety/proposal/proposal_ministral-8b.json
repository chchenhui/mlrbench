    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Dangerous Capabilities' challenge outlined in the task (point 5), proposing a solution that aims to balance safety and utility as requested. The methodology detailed in the proposal is a direct expansion of the research idea, incorporating the two-stage filter, risk classification, dynamic policies, and RLHF. Furthermore, the proposal leverages concepts like RLHF, risk-aware learning, and balancing helpfulness/harmlessness, which are central themes in the provided literature review. There are no significant inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the overall structure (Introduction, Methodology, Outcomes/Impact) is logical. The core concept of the two-stage Risk-Adaptive Filter is explained understandably. However, the technical descriptions, particularly the mathematical formulations for the risk classifier and policy enforcer, are very high-level placeholders. More detail on the specific models, algorithms (e.g., for RLHF), and the nature of 'safe-completion templates' would enhance clarity. While generally understandable, some implementation specifics remain ambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the components (risk classification, RLHF, dynamic policies) are based on existing techniques discussed in the literature (e.g., Safe RLHF, risk-aware RL), their specific integration into a two-stage, risk-adaptive filter *specifically for dangerous capability queries* is novel. The introduction of a 'medium-risk' tier with 'safe-completion templates' offers a nuanced approach beyond simple allow/block mechanisms. The continuous adaptation via RLHF for this specific threat vector also adds to the novelty. It's not groundbreaking in fundamental algorithms but presents an innovative system design for a critical problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established ML principles like supervised learning for classification and reinforcement learning (specifically RLHF). The two-stage filtering approach is logical. The reliance on RLHF aligns with current practices in AI safety (as shown in the literature). However, the soundness score is slightly limited by the lack of technical depth in the methodology section. The mathematical formulations are abstract, and assumptions about the trainability of the risk classifier and the effectiveness of RLHF in this specific, sensitive domain are present but not deeply explored. The evaluation plan using FNR and user satisfaction is appropriate."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML technology and expertise. Training classifiers and implementing policy logic are standard. RLHF, while complex, is increasingly operationalized. Data collection (taxonomy, adversarial examples, simulated queries) is a significant effort, especially curating a comprehensive 'dangerous capabilities' dataset, but achievable with domain expertise. The main challenges lie in the quality of the curated data, the robustness of the classifier, designing effective safe-completion templates, and the practical implementation of the RLHF feedback loop. Overall, the plan is realistic, albeit resource-intensive, with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in AI safety â€“ preventing the misuse of AI for generating dangerous knowledge, as highlighted in the task description. Successfully developing such a filter would be a major contribution, offering a more nuanced approach than current methods and directly impacting the safe deployment of powerful AI models. The focus on balancing safety with legitimate utility is critical for responsible AI development. The potential impact on AI safety practices is substantial."
