    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses the 'Agentic AI' trend highlighted in the task description. It focuses on ensuring agents respect safety protocols and avoid ethical issues (like privacy violations) by embedding proactive harm recognition into their decision-making, which aligns perfectly with the task's requirement to explore safety challenges for autonomous agents."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly defines the core concept (Harm Potential Predictor module), its integration mechanism (within planning/policy network), training approach (RL with simulated environments/datasets), and intended outcome (intrinsic avoidance of harm). Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the multi-dimensional harm score definition, the exact nature of the curated datasets, and the precise integration method (e.g., specific RL algorithm modifications), but the overall proposal is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While concepts like safe RL and constrained decision-making exist, the proposal to integrate a *learned, predictive* module specifically for multi-dimensional harm potential *within* the core decision loop of agentic systems is innovative. It moves beyond static rules or post-hoc checks towards proactive, learned safety awareness during planning/policy generation. It combines existing concepts (RL, predictive modeling) in a fresh way targeted at agentic AI safety."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Creating comprehensive and representative 'curated datasets of potential harms' is difficult and may struggle with completeness and bias. Training a 'Harm Potential Predictor' that generalizes effectively to novel situations is a major ML challenge. Integrating this module efficiently into complex agent decision processes (like MCTS or deep RL policies) without prohibitive computational overhead or negative impacts on task performance requires careful engineering. Access to diverse and realistic simulation environments is also crucial."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it tackles the critical and increasingly urgent problem of ensuring the safety and ethical alignment of autonomous AI agents. Successfully developing agents that proactively avoid harm during decision-making would be a major advancement in AI safety, enhancing trustworthiness and enabling safer deployment in real-world scenarios. It directly addresses a core barrier to the responsible development of agentic AI."
