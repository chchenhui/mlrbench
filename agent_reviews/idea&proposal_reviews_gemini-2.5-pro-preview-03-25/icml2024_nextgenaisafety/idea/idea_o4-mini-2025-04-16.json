        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea directly and comprehensively addresses the 'Dangerous Capabilities' challenge outlined in the task description. It focuses precisely on preventing AI misuse for harmful applications (bioweapons, cyber-attacks) while explicitly aiming to preserve beneficial research access, aligning perfectly with the task's requirement to balance safety and utility."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated with a well-defined motivation, a structured two-stage approach (risk classification followed by dynamic policy), and specific mechanisms for implementation (threat taxonomy, adversarial examples, RLHF) and evaluation. The core concept of risk-adaptive filtering with multiple response levels is immediately understandable, although minor details about the taxonomy or template design could be further elaborated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While individual components like classifiers for risk, RLHF, and query filtering exist, the proposed combination and specific implementation offer notable originality. The novelty lies in the dynamic, multi-level response system (allow, safe template, refuse) based on a continuous risk score, the explicit use of a curated threat taxonomy combined with adversarial examples for training, and the concept of 'safe-completion templates' as a middle ground between full disclosure and refusal. It represents a sophisticated refinement of existing safety paradigms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal leverages established machine learning techniques (classification, RLHF) and system design patterns. Implementing the classifier, policy mechanism, and RLHF loop is practical with current technology. Key challenges, such as curating a comprehensive threat taxonomy, generating effective adversarial examples, and designing robust safe-completion templates, are significant but achievable with dedicated effort and resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical and escalating AI safety problem: preventing the misuse of increasingly capable AI for generating dangerous knowledge. Successfully developing such a system would have a high impact, providing a crucial safeguard, contributing significantly to responsible AI deployment, and potentially influencing industry standards for managing dual-use capabilities in AI."
