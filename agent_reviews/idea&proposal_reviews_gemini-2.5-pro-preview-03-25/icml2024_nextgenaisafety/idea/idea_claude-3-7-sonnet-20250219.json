        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses the safety challenges associated with 'Agentic AI', which is the first emerging trend listed in the task description. It focuses on ensuring autonomous agents adhere to safety protocols and ethical boundaries through constraint optimization, aligning perfectly with the task's call for solutions to manage unintended consequences and ethical issues in autonomous systems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the core concepts (dual optimization, ethical boundary models, hierarchical architecture, interpretability) are introduced. However, the specific mechanisms of how the 'ethical boundary models' would be learned, represented, and dynamically adapted could be slightly more detailed for perfect clarity. Overall, the proposal is understandable and its objectives are well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While safe RL and constrained optimization are existing fields, the proposed combination and specific mechanisms offer notable originality. The core innovation appears to be the concept of 'ethical boundary models' that dynamically evolve alongside the agent's capabilities and the integration of this with a hierarchical, interpretable safety architecture. This dynamic adaptation aspect presents a fresh perspective compared to more static safety constraint approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is conceptually sound but presents significant implementation challenges. Defining and operationalizing 'ethical principles' into computable constraints is notoriously difficult. Creating 'ethical boundary models' that dynamically and reliably identify potential safety violations in complex, open-ended environments during exploration is a major hurdle. Ensuring constraint satisfaction *guarantees* in RL, especially with function approximation and evolving constraints, is technically demanding. Considerable research and potentially new algorithmic developments would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a critical and highly significant problem in AI: ensuring the safety and ethical alignment of increasingly autonomous agents. As highlighted by the task description, this is a key challenge for the future of AI. A successful outcome could provide a foundational framework for developing trustworthy AI systems capable of operating safely in the real world, leading to major advancements in AI safety."
