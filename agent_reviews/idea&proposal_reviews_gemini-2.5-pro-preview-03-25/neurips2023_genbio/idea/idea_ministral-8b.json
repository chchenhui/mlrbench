    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The GenBio workshop explicitly lists 'Rational protein design: Prediction and optimization of protein sequences and/or structures, incorporating constraints and prior knowledge' and 'Sequence-based methods: large language models for protein / genomic sequences, sequence-based molecular design' as key topics. The proposed idea directly addresses these points by focusing on a sequence-level generative AI model using LLMs for rational protein design with constraints."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It outlines the motivation, a logical sequence of steps (data collection, training, constraint incorporation, evaluation, refinement), and expected outcomes. The core concept of using sequence-level LLMs for protein design is understandable. However, specifics regarding the exact LLM architecture, the precise methods for constraint incorporation, and the detailed evaluation metrics could be further elaborated for perfect clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While using generative models (including LLMs) for protein sequence design is an active and established research area (e.g., ProteinMPNN, ProGen, ESM variants), the specific focus on sequence-level generation combined with reinforcement learning and sophisticated constraint incorporation offers some innovation. It builds upon existing work rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking paradigm. The novelty lies more in the potential refinement and integration of these techniques than in the fundamental concept itself."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Large protein sequence/structure datasets are available, LLM training techniques are established (though computationally expensive), and methods for evaluation exist. Incorporating complex biological constraints (stability, solubility, binding) is challenging but an active area of research with potential solutions (e.g., guided generation, RL rewards). The main hurdles are the significant computational resources required for training large models and the potential need for experimental validation, which requires lab access and resources. Overall, it's feasible but requires substantial effort and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Rational protein design is a critical bottleneck in drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and synthetic biology. Developing a robust generative AI model that can efficiently design functional proteins with desired properties would represent a major advancement, significantly accelerating research and development in healthcare, biotechnology, and biomanufacturing, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of understanding and reprogramming biology."
