        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task calls for exploring challenges, failure modes, and common underlying reasons for DL failures in real-world applications across domains, using the ICBINB workshop as a platform. The idea directly addresses this by proposing the development of a cross-domain taxonomy of these failures, explicitly using ICBINB submissions as a primary data source. It aims to identify common patterns ('root cause', 'manifestation') and facilitate cross-domain learning, which are central goals outlined in the task description. The proposed output (taxonomy, database, guidelines) directly supports the workshop's objective of enhancing understanding and facilitating more successful DL deployment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (lack of unified failure understanding), the main objective (develop a cross-domain taxonomy), the methodology (qualitative coding/clustering on case studies), the structure of the taxonomy (root cause, manifestation, context), the data sources (ICBINB submissions, literature), validation methods (expert feedback, historical cases), and expected outcomes (database, guidelines, gap identification). The example provided effectively illustrates the concept. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While taxonomies exist in other fields, the development of a systematic, empirically derived, cross-domain taxonomy specifically for *real-world deep learning deployment failures* is innovative. Current discussions are often siloed; this work explicitly aims to synthesize knowledge across domains. The focus on deployment issues beyond benchmark performance, and the use of qualitative analysis on community-sourced failure reports (like ICBINB) to build this framework, offers a fresh perspective. The novelty lies primarily in the specific application, scope, and synthesis rather than entirely new methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The proposed methods (qualitative coding, clustering) are standard research techniques. Accessing literature for historical cases is straightforward. Validation through expert feedback is achievable. The main potential challenge lies in the dependency on the quantity and quality of ICBINB workshop submissions, which are a primary data source. However, this can be mitigated by supplementing with published case studies. The effort required for coding and analysis is significant but manageable within a typical research project. Creating a public database is also technically feasible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding and mitigating real-world DL failures is a critical challenge hindering reliable AI deployment. A unified, cross-domain taxonomy addresses a major gap by providing a common language and framework. This could significantly help practitioners anticipate risks, guide research towards crucial weaknesses, enable the transfer of mitigation strategies across domains, and ultimately improve the safety and reliability of DL systems. The public database could become a vital resource for the ML community, directly contributing to the goals of the ICBINB initiative."
