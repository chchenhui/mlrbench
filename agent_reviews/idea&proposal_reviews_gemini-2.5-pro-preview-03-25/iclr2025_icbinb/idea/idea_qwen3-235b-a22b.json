        "justification": "The research idea 'X-Cause' aligns excellently with the task description for the 'I Can't Believe It's Not Better' workshop. The workshop aims to explore challenges, failure modes, and underlying reasons for DL failures in real-world scenarios across domains, fostering discussion on negative results. X-Cause directly addresses this by proposing a systematic framework using XAI and RCA to diagnose these failures, identify root causes (data, model, deployment), and create a taxonomy of failure patterns. This directly supports the workshop's goal of understanding *why* DL fails and identifying common reasons across disciplines. A paper describing the X-Cause framework and initial findings would fit perfectly within the workshop's scope, providing a method for the 'investigation' component required in submissions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly articulates the problem of ad hoc failure analysis in deployed DL systems. The main idea is well-defined, outlining a structured approach involving collaboration, specific XAI techniques (SHAP, ICE), validation methods (counterfactuals, ablation), and concrete outputs (repository, taxonomy, tool, dataset). The goals and expected impact are explicitly stated and easy to understand. There is minimal ambiguity in the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While XAI techniques and RCA principles exist independently, their systematic integration into a dedicated framework ('X-Cause') specifically for diagnosing real-world DL failures across diverse domains is innovative. Creating a structured taxonomy of DL failure modes derived from XAI-driven RCA, along with a benchmark dataset of annotated failure cases and a diagnostic tool, represents a significant and original contribution. It moves beyond explaining individual predictions to diagnosing systemic failures, addressing a specific gap in current practice."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces considerable implementation challenges. The technical components (applying XAI, performing counterfactual analysis) are generally achievable with current methods, albeit potentially resource-intensive. However, the core challenge lies in (1) successfully collaborating with domain experts across multiple fields (healthcare, robotics, fairness) to obtain detailed, high-quality data on real-world failure cases, which can be difficult due to proprietary concerns or lack of systematic logging, and (2) the significant effort required to build and validate the repository, taxonomy, and software tool. The project requires substantial coordination, diverse expertise, and potentially significant funding."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the reliable deployment of DL: the lack of systematic understanding and diagnosis of real-world failures. Success would lead to major advancements by enabling proactive failure mitigation, enhancing model transparency and trustworthiness, accelerating debugging cycles, and bridging the gap between ML theory and practice. The proposed outputs (taxonomy, tool, dataset) could become invaluable resources for the entire ML community, fostering a culture of learning from failures as promoted by the ICBINB workshop."
