    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call to investigate real-world DL failures, collect cases, identify underlying reasons (data, model, deployment), and promote transparency, specifically focusing on the healthcare domain mentioned in the task. It perfectly matches the research idea's goal of creating a systematic framework, taxonomy, and decision-support tool for healthcare DL failures. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and builds upon the challenges identified in the literature review, such as underspecification, deployment issues, adversarial attacks, distribution shifts, and workflow integration, using them to motivate the research and shape the methodology."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, research objectives, methodology (broken down into logical phases and specific steps), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The inclusion of specific metrics with formulas enhances clarity. The structure is logical and easy to follow. While minor details like the exact recruitment process or specifics of 'mini-experiments' could be elaborated further, the overall proposal is immediately understandable and presents a clear research plan."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing concepts (e.g., metrics for shift, fairness, calibration; awareness of deployment challenges), its novelty lies in the synthesis: creating a *systematic*, *multi-dimensional*, and *quantitative* framework specifically for analyzing *real-world healthcare* DL failures. The development of a quantitative taxonomy based on clustering failure metrics and the design of a predictive decision-support tool that maps deployment characteristics to failure risks and mitigation strategies are significant innovations beyond existing surveys or studies focusing on single failure aspects. The emphasis on collecting and structuring real-world failure cases is also a valuable contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established ML concepts (distribution shift, calibration, fairness, underspecification) identified in the literature. The methodology employs a robust mix of qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (case analysis, simulations, metrics) methods. The chosen metrics (D_KL, ECE, Delta_EO, ensemble variance) are standard and appropriate for the dimensions being measured, and the technical formulations are correct. The plan includes validation through new applications. Minor weaknesses include the potential need for more diverse metrics within each category and the assumption that complex mitigation strategies can be reliably mapped from cluster analysis, but the overall approach is methodologically strong."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning Phase 1 data collection. Recruiting healthcare providers and AI vendors to share detailed, potentially sensitive data on deployment failures (including model details, outcomes, performance drops) is likely to be difficult due to confidentiality, liability, and documentation issues. Achieving the target of 50+ detailed cases might be overly optimistic. While simulations, metric computation, tool development, and validation are technically feasible, their success heavily depends on obtaining rich data from the initial case studies. The 18-month timeline appears tight given these potential data acquisition hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical problem of DL failures in real-world healthcare, which directly impacts patient safety and trust in AI. The potential outcomes – a public failure corpus, a validated taxonomy, and a practical decision-support tool – could lead to major advancements in developing and deploying safer, more reliable medical AI. This work has the potential to influence clinical practice, guide future research towards robustness and fairness (aligning with ICBINB goals), and potentially inform regulatory standards. The methodology's potential generalization to other domains further enhances its significance."
