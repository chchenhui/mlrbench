    "Consistency": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the research idea and the literature review, directly addressing the challenges (underspecification, deployment issues, distribution shifts, clinical integration) mentioned. It also fits the core theme of the task description (ICBINB workshop) by focusing on real-world DL failures, investigating why solutions from literature fail in practice. However, the task description emphasizes collecting failures across *diverse* fields to find *common* patterns, while the proposal focuses *specifically* and deeply on healthcare. Additionally, the proposal outlines a large-scale research project to be undertaken, rather than reporting on a specific completed negative result investigation, which seems more typical for the described workshop submission format. While healthcare is a valid and important domain for the workshop, the narrow focus and project-proposal nature create a slight misalignment with the broader, cross-domain comparative goal and typical submission style outlined in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context effectively, the motivation is compelling, and the objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section is detailed, breaking down the approach into logical components (case collection, interviews, simulations, framework development) with specific steps and even mathematical formulations for key metrics. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While the problem of the 'reality gap' in AI deployment (especially in healthcare) is known, the proposal's novelty lies in its systematic, multi-dimensional, and mixed-methods approach specifically tailored to healthcare failures. It goes beyond existing surveys or technical analyses by proposing to integrate qualitative insights (case studies, interviews) with quantitative simulations (distribution shift, bias, workflow, interpretability) to build a comprehensive taxonomy, a causal model of failures, and practical mitigation strategies/tools. The focus on creating a structured framework and a readiness assessment tool specifically for healthcare AI failures represents a notable and innovative contribution compared to prior work which is often broader or focuses on single aspects of failure."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong methodological soundness. It is well-grounded in the cited literature and employs a rigorous mixed-methods approach. The combination of retrospective case analysis, stakeholder interviews, and controlled simulations provides triangulation and strengthens the potential findings. The specific dimensions chosen for simulation (data shift, subgroup bias, workflow, interpretability) are relevant and cover key failure areas. The inclusion of standard metrics and mathematical formulations (KL divergence, disparity ratios, fidelity) adds rigor. A potential minor weakness lies in the assumption that sufficient access to detailed, potentially sensitive, internal failure reports from healthcare institutions can be secured, which is crucial for the case study component, but the overall research design is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines an ambitious research plan. While the technical components (simulations, data analysis, framework development) are feasible with appropriate expertise and resources, the primary challenge lies in the data acquisition phase. Gaining access to detailed, documented cases of AI failures within healthcare institutions is likely to be difficult due to confidentiality (HIPAA), liability concerns, and institutional reluctance to share negative results. Securing strong collaborations and navigating ethical approvals (IRB) will be critical and time-consuming. Conducting comprehensive stakeholder interviews and realistic workflow simulations also requires significant effort and resources. The project's success heavily depends on overcoming the data access barrier."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research proposal addresses a highly significant problem with substantial potential impact. Failures of AI systems in healthcare carry high stakes, affecting patient safety, clinical decision-making, resource allocation, and clinician trust. Understanding the root causes of these failures and developing systematic ways to mitigate them is critical for the responsible and effective adoption of AI in medicine. The expected outcomes – a taxonomy of failures, causal models, mitigation strategies, and a readiness assessment tool – would provide immense value to healthcare organizations, AI developers, regulators, clinicians, and ultimately patients. This research could significantly contribute to bridging the gap between AI's potential and its practical utility in healthcare."
