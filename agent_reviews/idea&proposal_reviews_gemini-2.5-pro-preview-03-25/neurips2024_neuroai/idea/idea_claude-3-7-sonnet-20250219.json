    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the NeuroAI theme by proposing a neuro-inspired computation (predictive coding) to tackle a key challenge in AI (efficient multi-sensory integration). This fits squarely within the 'Self-supervised Systems in NeuroAI' topic, which explicitly mentions predictive coding as a key paradigm inspired by biological intelligence. Furthermore, the goal of achieving computational efficiency directly matches the workshop's aim to 'drive the development of computationally less intensive artificial systems'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (limitations of current AI in multi-sensory integration vs. brain efficiency) is well-defined. The core proposal (hierarchical predictive coding across modalities, bidirectional pathways, precision-weighted errors, continuous prediction) is clearly articulated and understandable. The expected outcomes (efficiency gains, robustness) are explicitly stated, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While predictive coding is a known concept from neuroscience and its application to AI is an active research area, the specific proposal for a *hierarchical* architecture implementing *continuous cross-modal predictions* with *precision-weighted error signals* specifically for *efficient multi-sensory integration* offers a notable and innovative combination of existing concepts. It moves beyond standard multi-modal fusion techniques by proposing a specific, neuro-inspired mechanism for dynamic, efficient integration."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Implementing hierarchical neural networks, predictive coding mechanisms, and multi-modal data processing are achievable with current machine learning techniques and frameworks. However, designing the specific bidirectional pathways and precision-weighting mechanisms effectively poses a moderate challenge. Accessing or creating suitable, large-scale, synchronized multi-sensory datasets (vision, audio, tactile) might also present practical difficulties. Demonstrating the claimed 30-40% efficiency gain requires careful benchmarking and validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Efficient and robust multi-sensory integration is a fundamental capability lacking in many current AI systems but crucial for applications like robotics, autonomous vehicles, and advanced human-computer interaction. Achieving substantial computational efficiency improvements (as claimed) would be highly valuable, particularly for resource-constrained environments. Success could lead to more brain-like AI and potentially offer testable computational models for neuroscience."
