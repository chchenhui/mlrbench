        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Self-supervised Systems in NeuroAI' topic by explicitly proposing the integration of predictive coding and active inference into AI systems (specifically RL). It also aligns with the workshop's goal of developing 'computationally less intensive artificial systems trained using small-data regimes' by focusing on data-efficient RL. Furthermore, it touches upon 'Neuro-inspired reasoning and decision-making' through its action selection mechanism based on minimizing expected free energy. The motivation and approach resonate strongly with the workshop's theme of bridging neuroscience and AI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (RL data inefficiency vs. biological efficiency), the core concepts (predictive coding, active inference, free energy minimization), the proposed mechanism (hierarchical PC networks, action selection via expected free energy), and the evaluation plan are all clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architecture of the hierarchical PC networks and the precise method for calculating expected free energy, but the overall research direction and goals are well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While applying predictive coding and active inference principles to learning and decision-making is an active area in NeuroAI, integrating them specifically within a hierarchical predictive coding framework for data-efficient RL, with action selection driven by minimizing *expected* free energy alongside reward, offers a fresh perspective. It combines existing concepts (PC, AI, RL) in a specific way aimed at a known challenge (sample efficiency). It's not entirely groundbreaking, as related work exists, but the proposed synthesis and focus represent a novel contribution within the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Implementing stable and efficient hierarchical predictive coding networks is non-trivial. Calculating or approximating *expected* free energy for action selection can be computationally very expensive, especially in complex environments or over longer horizons. Integrating these complex components into a functioning RL agent requires substantial technical expertise and careful engineering. While theoretically grounded, the practical implementation requires overcoming known computational hurdles associated with active inference models."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Improving the sample efficiency of RL agents is a critical challenge in AI, and achieving this through neuro-inspired principles like predictive coding and active inference would be a major advancement. Success would not only lead to more practical RL systems but also provide computational validation for these neuroscience theories. It addresses a fundamental problem (learning efficiency) with a principled approach that could influence future AI design and offer insights back into biological intelligence."
