    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of the NeuroAI workshop by proposing an integration of neuroscience principles (predictive coding, active inference) with AI to tackle key challenges like computational intensity and data requirements ('computationally less intensive artificial systems trained using small-data regimes'). The idea falls squarely under the workshop topic 'Self-supervised Systems in NeuroAI', which explicitly mentions predictive coding and active inference as emerging paradigms inspired by biological intelligence. It also touches upon 'Neuro-inspired reasoning and decision-making' through its application in autonomous systems (robotic navigation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (data/compute efficiency), the core concepts (predictive coding, active inference), the proposed mechanism (hierarchical prediction, error correction, active sampling), the evaluation context (robotic navigation, comparison with RL), and the expected outcomes (quantified data reduction, adaptability) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The impact is also clearly stated. It provides a strong understanding of the research direction."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While predictive coding and active inference are established concepts, their explicit integration into a single, unified neural framework specifically targeting sample efficiency in AI, particularly within dynamic and sparse-reward environments, offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond theoretical discussion to propose a concrete implementation and evaluation strategy. It's not proposing entirely new fundamental theories but represents a novel synthesis and application focus within the NeuroAI space, combining existing concepts in a potentially powerful way."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Computational models of predictive coding and active inference exist, although integrating them effectively into a robust neural framework presents engineering challenges. Simulating environments like robotic navigation and comparing against RL baselines are standard practices. The main challenges lie in the complexity of the implementation, tuning the parameters of such a combined system, and potentially the computational resources needed for hierarchical models. The stated goal of a 50% data reduction is ambitious but measurable. Overall, it's challenging but achievable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the sample inefficiency and computational cost of current AI models is a critical problem. By leveraging neuro-inspired principles like predictive coding and active inference, the research aims to create AI systems that learn more efficiently and adaptively, akin to biological intelligence. Success could lead to major advancements in AI robustness and applicability in real-world, dynamic settings (e.g., autonomous systems, personalized healthcare) where large datasets are unavailable or environments change frequently, directly contributing to the goals of developing more capable and efficient AI."
