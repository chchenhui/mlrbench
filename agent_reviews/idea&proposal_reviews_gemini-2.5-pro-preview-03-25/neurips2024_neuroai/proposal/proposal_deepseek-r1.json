    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeuroAI theme by focusing on self-supervised systems (predictive coding, active inference) and neuro-inspired computations, aiming for data efficiency as highlighted in the task description. It faithfully translates the research idea into a concrete plan, incorporating hierarchical predictive coding and active inference via EFE minimization. Furthermore, it effectively builds upon the cited literature, referencing active predictive coding concepts and acknowledging computational challenges (SPEQ), directly tackling the key challenges identified in the review (sample efficiency, representation learning, exploration/exploitation balance)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section outlines the core components (hierarchical PCUs, free energy, EFE), provides relevant mathematical formulations, and details the algorithm steps and experimental design. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific neural network architectures for PCUs or the precise implementation details of EFE calculation, but these are acceptable at the proposal stage. Overall, the core concepts and plan are presented clearly."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While predictive coding and active inference are established concepts (as shown in the literature review), their specific integration into a hierarchical model-based RL framework using EFE minimization for action selection to explicitly tackle sample efficiency on standard RL benchmarks represents a novel synthesis. It differs from prior work that might focus more on perception or theoretical aspects. The combination of hierarchical predictive coding for world modeling, EFE for policy optimization, and practical considerations like stabilization phases (inspired by SPEQ) constitutes a fresh approach within the RL landscape."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks (predictive coding, active inference, variational inference, RL). The methodology uses appropriate concepts like free energy minimization for model learning and EFE for action selection. The mathematical formulations presented are standard for these theories. The experimental design is robust, including relevant benchmarks, strong baselines (DreamerV3, PPO), appropriate metrics, and ablation studies. While the practical implementation of EFE can be complex, the theoretical underpinnings and overall approach are well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. Implementing and training hierarchical predictive coding networks combined with EFE-based action selection is technically complex and likely computationally intensive, requiring significant expertise and resources (GPU time). Calculating EFE accurately often involves approximations or extensive sampling. While the experimental plan is standard, achieving stable training and demonstrating the ambitious 30-50% sample efficiency improvement over strong baselines like DreamerV3 carries moderate risk. The inclusion of stabilization phases acknowledges potential efficiency issues but adds to implementation complexity."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of sample inefficiency in RL, a major barrier to real-world deployment. Success would represent a substantial technical contribution, potentially enabling RL in data-constrained domains like robotics and healthcare. Scientifically, it offers a valuable computational testbed for neuro-inspired theories (predictive coding, active inference), potentially yielding insights into biological learning mechanisms. The potential impact on both AI methodology and computational neuroscience is substantial."
