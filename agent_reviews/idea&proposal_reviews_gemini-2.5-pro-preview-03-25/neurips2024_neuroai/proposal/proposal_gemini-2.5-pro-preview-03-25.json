    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeuroAI themes of neuro-inspired computation (PC), self-supervised systems (PC world model learning), and neuro-inspired reasoning/decision-making (AIF action selection). The proposal faithfully expands on the core research idea, elaborating the motivation, mechanism (PC+AIF), and evaluation strategy. It effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, particularly the work on active predictive coding (Rao et al., Gklezakos & Rao) and AIF principles (Friston, Ororbia et al.), while also acknowledging related challenges like computational efficiency (Romeo et al.). The research problem (RL sample efficiency), objectives, methodology, and significance are all tightly interwoven and consistent with the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with background and motivation, clearly stating the research problem and objectives. The theoretical underpinnings (PC and AIF) are explained well, including relevant mathematical formulations. The proposed PCAI-RL architecture and algorithmic steps are described comprehensibly, even if specific implementation details are left open (which is normal for a proposal). The experimental plan, including benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is detailed and unambiguous. The language is precise and technical where needed, making the proposal easy to understand for someone familiar with RL and computational neuroscience concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While Predictive Coding for world models and Active Inference as a theory are established, their specific integration into a single, functional RL agent (PCAI-RL) where action selection is explicitly driven by minimizing Expected Free Energy (balancing pragmatic and epistemic value) to improve sample efficiency appears novel. It distinguishes itself from standard model-based RL (which typically optimizes for reward within the model) and prior work cited (which might focus on representation learning or use PC/AIF components differently). The novelty lies in the specific synergistic combination and its application to tackle the sample efficiency problem in RL through principled, uncertainty-driven exploration derived directly from AIF."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established neuroscientific theories (PC, AIF) and leverages relevant concepts from machine learning (RL, generative models, variational inference). The proposed methodology, integrating a PC world model with AIF-based planning, is logically coherent. The mathematical formulations presented for free energy and expected free energy are standard within the AIF literature. The experimental design is rigorous, employing relevant benchmarks, strong baselines, and appropriate metrics. Potential technical challenges (computational cost, tuning, model accuracy) are acknowledged, demonstrating foresight. Minor uncertainties exist around the specific approximations needed for EFE calculation in practice, but the overall approach is theoretically well-supported."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning the computational cost of the Active Inference module. Calculating Expected Free Energy typically involves simulating multiple future trajectories under different policies using the learned world model and evaluating uncertainty/information gain, which can be computationally prohibitive, especially for complex environments, high-dimensional state spaces, or long planning horizons. While the proposal acknowledges this and suggests mitigations (approximations, efficient planning, parallelization), successfully implementing an efficient yet effective EFE calculation and planning mechanism remains a considerable hurdle. Tuning the complex interplay between the PC model, inference, and AIF planning also adds to the difficulty. It requires significant computational resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of sample inefficiency in RL, which severely limits its real-world applicability. By leveraging principles from neuroscience (PC/AIF), it promises a principled approach to data-efficient learning and exploration. Success would represent a major advancement in RL, provide strong support for the utility of neuro-inspired AI (a core goal of the NeuroAI task), potentially offer insights back into neuroscience, and could lead to new classes of AI architectures. The potential impact on enabling RL in data-scarce domains like robotics or healthcare is substantial."
