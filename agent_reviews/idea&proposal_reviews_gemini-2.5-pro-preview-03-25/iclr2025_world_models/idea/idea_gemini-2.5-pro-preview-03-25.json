    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop scope). The workshop explicitly lists 'causality analysis' and 'Understanding World Rules: Exploring how World Models capture environment dynamics, causal understanding...' as key topics. This research idea directly targets improving the 'causal understanding' of world models, a central theme mentioned multiple times. It also references relevant architectures (Transformers, SSMs) and evaluation methods, fitting squarely within the workshop's focus areas."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of correlational world models), the core proposal (predicting counterfactual latent states from interventions), the general architectural direction (Transformers/SSMs + intervention mechanisms), and the evaluation plan (zero-shot generalization, latent space analysis) are clearly presented. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact implementation of the 'intervention-sensitive mechanisms' or the precise formulation of the counterfactual loss, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While research on causal representation learning and world models exists, the specific proposal to train world models by predicting *counterfactual latent state deviations* resulting from explicit intervention signals during training appears to be a novel approach. It combines standard world model training with a specific causal objective in a potentially unique way, offering a fresh perspective on integrating causality into sequence prediction models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It relies on standard architectures (Transformers/SSMs) and training paradigms. Implementing the counterfactual prediction objective seems technically achievable, especially within simulated environments where interventions and their outcomes can be controlled and observed. Evaluation methods like zero-shot generalization in simulation and latent space analysis are standard practices. The main challenges lie in designing effective intervention-sensitive mechanisms and ensuring the counterfactual objective leads to meaningful causal representations, but these seem like solvable engineering and research problems rather than fundamental roadblocks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Addressing the lack of robust causal understanding is a critical limitation of current world models, hindering their generalization and reliability, especially for decision-making and planning under interventions (e.g., in robotics, healthcare). Successfully developing causality-aware world models could lead to major advancements in model-based RL, safer AI interaction, better out-of-distribution generalization, and more interpretable AI systems. The potential impact on various application domains mentioned in the workshop scope is substantial."
