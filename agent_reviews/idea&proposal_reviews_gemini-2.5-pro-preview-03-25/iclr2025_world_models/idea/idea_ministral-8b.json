        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the theme 'Scaling World Models prediction and generation across language, vision, and control' by proposing a multi-modal fusion framework (text, vision, audio). It focuses on enhancing realism and prediction, uses transformer-based architectures (mentioned as a key backbone), and targets applications (robotics, healthcare, sciences) explicitly listed in the workshop scope. The idea fits perfectly within the topics of interest, particularly 'integrating visual, auditory, and textual data improves realism World Models'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of current world models), the main proposal (multi-modal fusion framework using transformers and cross-modal attention), and outlines a logical methodology (data collection, architecture, training, evaluation, application). The expected outcomes and potential impact are also clearly articulated, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While multi-modal fusion and transformer architectures are established concepts, the specific application of integrating text, vision, *and* audio using cross-modal attention within transformers *specifically for enhancing the realism and predictive capabilities of world models* offers a novel contribution. It builds upon existing trends (like large multi-modal models) but focuses them on the core world modeling problem in a relevant way. It's not groundbreaking in inventing the core techniques but combines and applies them innovatively to a specific, important problem area within the workshop's scope."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Transformer architectures and multi-modal learning techniques are well-developed. Required computational resources are significant but accessible in many research labs. The main challenges lie in acquiring or creating well-synchronized, large-scale multi-modal datasets and the computational cost of training potentially very large models. However, these are engineering and resource challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks, making the idea practical and implementable with current technology and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Improving the realism and predictive accuracy of world models by incorporating richer sensory information is a crucial step towards more capable AI agents. Success in this research could lead to meaningful advancements in areas like embodied AI (better navigation and interaction), realistic simulations for training and testing, and improved understanding/modeling in scientific domains. Addressing the limitations of uni-modal or less integrated world models tackles an important problem in the field."
