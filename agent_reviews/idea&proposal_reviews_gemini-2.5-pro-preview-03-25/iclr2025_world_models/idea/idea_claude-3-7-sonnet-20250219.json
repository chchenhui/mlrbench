        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop scope). The workshop explicitly lists 'causality analysis' and 'causal understanding' under the topic 'Understanding World Rules'. It also highlights 'Model-Based Reinforcement Learning' as a relevant area. The proposed idea directly addresses building world models that incorporate causal understanding for interpretable model-based RL, fitting squarely within the core themes and specific topics of interest mentioned in the workshop call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (black-box world models lacking causal reasoning). The main idea is broken down logically into three core components (causal discovery, causal world model encoder, planning algorithm) and specifies the training approach (hybrid loss) and evaluation criteria (performance and interpretability). The goal of achieving accurate prediction alongside causal explanation is explicitly stated and easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While research exists separately on world models, causal discovery, and interpretable RL, the proposed integration of explicit causal discovery algorithms *directly into* the world model learning process for enhanced interpretability and planning in RL is innovative. It moves beyond purely correlational world models by aiming for structured causal representations learned from interaction, offering a fresh perspective compared to standard world model architectures."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology but presents moderate challenges. Standard world model architectures and RL algorithms are available. Causal discovery algorithms exist, but applying them effectively to potentially high-dimensional, sequential data from agent interactions can be complex, often requiring assumptions or specific data types (like interventional data, which might be hard to collect). Integrating the causal structure into the latent space and using it for planning is conceptually sound but requires careful implementation. Evaluating interpretability rigorously also poses a challenge. Overall, it's feasible for research but requires careful design and potentially starts with simpler environments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the lack of interpretability and causal reasoning in world models tackles a critical limitation in current AI. Success could lead to more robust, generalizable, and trustworthy AI agents, particularly in complex decision-making tasks. Enhancing model-based RL with causal understanding could improve sample efficiency and performance in scenarios requiring deep environmental understanding. This directly contributes to the workshop's goal of 'Understanding the World and Extracting Knowledge' and has broad implications for XAI and RL."
