        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'causal understanding' and 'World Model training and evaluation' by proposing a specific method for integrating causality via counterfactual prediction. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon relevant papers from the literature review (e.g., CoPhy, Melnychuk et al., White & Green, Purple & Orange), positioning the work within the current research landscape and addressing the identified challenges like generalization to unseen interventions and learning causal representations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context effectively, the objectives are specific and measurable, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the proposed architecture (CHyTS), data generation, training procedure, and evaluation plan. Equations are used appropriately to define key components like the temporal prior and attention modulation. The structure is logical, flowing from motivation to expected outcomes. While minor implementation details could always be expanded, the core concepts and plan are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the idea of incorporating causality and counterfactual reasoning into world models is gaining traction (as evidenced by the 2022-2023 papers in the literature review), the specific proposed architecture (CHyTS - Causal Hybrid Transformer-SSM) and the mechanisms for integrating counterfactual context (conditioning SSM parameters *and* modulating attention based on intervention contrast) represent a novel synthesis. It moves beyond just identifying the need for causality towards proposing a concrete, integrated model architecture and training paradigm. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it builds on existing components and concepts, but the specific combination and approach offer a fresh perspective distinct from purely diffusion-based or standard transformer approaches cited."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in sequence modeling (Transformers, SSMs) and causal inference concepts (interventions, counterfactuals). The proposed methodology (CHyTS architecture, joint factual/counterfactual loss, curriculum learning, regularization techniques like KL divergence on a PC-estimated graph and domain confusion) is technically plausible and well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics targeting causal aspects (SHD, zero-shot generalization), and ablation studies. Minor weaknesses include the reliance on the empirical effectiveness of the proposed conditioning mechanisms and the potential difficulty of accurately estimating a causal graph in the latent space using the PC algorithm for regularization."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It relies on standard simulation environments (CoPhy, MuJoCo/PyBullet) and deep learning frameworks. Generating counterfactual data in simulation is achievable. However, implementing the proposed CHyTS architecture, particularly the dual conditioning mechanisms (in the SSM and attention) and integrating the causal graph regularization (PC-algorithm), requires significant engineering effort and expertise. Tuning the hyperparameters (like lambda for the loss terms, beta for attention modulation) and the curriculum learning strategy will likely be complex and time-consuming. The risks associated with achieving robust zero-shot generalization are non-trivial but manageable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized limitation of current world models â€“ their inability to reason causally and generalize robustly to interventions. Improving this capability is crucial for deploying AI agents in complex, high-stakes environments like robotics and healthcare, domains explicitly mentioned in the task description. Success would represent a major advancement in model-based RL, simulation fidelity, and trustworthy AI. The expected outcomes, particularly improved zero-shot generalization to unseen interventions and interpretable causal latent representations, would make substantial contributions to the field."
