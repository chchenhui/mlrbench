        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's interest in 'causal understanding' and 'causality analysis' within world models. The methodology follows logically from the research idea of using counterfactual prediction to imbue world models with causality. Furthermore, it appropriately situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant recent works on causal/counterfactual modeling and planning to use some as baselines, indicating a clear understanding of the current research landscape and challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, motivation, objectives, methodology, and evaluation plan are presented logically. The architecture and loss function components are defined, including mathematical formulations. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for inferring the 'ground-truth' latent states \\\\hat z_{\\\\tau} from interventional observations for the counterfactual loss, but these do not significantly obscure the overall approach. The structure is easy to follow, making the proposal generally understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the core idea of incorporating causality and counterfactual reasoning into latent variable models or world models is present in the recent literature (as acknowledged by the proposal and literature review, e.g., papers 5-10), the specific proposed implementation—extending a variational state-space framework with dual decoders, a specific counterfactual latent prediction loss (\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\\\\\mathrm{cf}}), and combining it with a factual ELBO and a total correlation regularizer—represents a novel synthesis of existing techniques tailored to world models. It's more of an innovative integration and refinement than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established methods like variational state-space models, RNNs/Transformers/SSMs, and standard optimization techniques. The theoretical motivation for using interventions and counterfactual prediction to learn causal structure is valid. The proposed architecture and loss function are technically plausible. The mathematical formulations are generally correct, though minor details like the inference of \\\\\\\\hat z_{\\\\tau} could be specified more rigorously. The evaluation plan using simulated environments with known ground truth and relevant metrics (ATE, causal alignment, planning) is appropriate."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on standard deep learning components and simulation environments (MuJoCo, Gym, etc.) that are widely available. Generating factual and interventional trajectories in simulation is straightforward. The proposed dataset sizes and model complexity appear manageable with typical research computing resources. The evaluation methods are standard in the field. While tuning the loss weights (\\\\\\\\lambda_{\\\\\\\\mathrm{cf}}, \\\\\\\\lambda_{\\\\\\\\mathrm{reg}}) might require effort, there are no obvious roadblocks suggesting the project is infeasible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current world models – their reliance on correlation rather than causation, which hinders robustness and generalization. Successfully developing world models that can reason about interventions and predict counterfactuals would be a major advancement, particularly for applications requiring safety and reliability, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare simulations. The potential impact on model interpretability and robust planning under distribution shift is substantial."
