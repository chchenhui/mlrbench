    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on world models, including causality analysis, classical backbones (Transformers, SSMs), training, evaluation, and applications (robotics, healthcare). The methodology faithfully implements the core research idea of using counterfactual latent state prediction. Furthermore, it is well-grounded in the provided literature, citing relevant works (DCM, Causal Transformer, CoPhy) and explicitly aiming to tackle key challenges identified in the review, such as learning causal representations and generalizing to interventions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes). The research objectives, data sources, high-level architecture (Transformer+SSM hybrid, intervention head), training objectives (dual loss with equations), and evaluation plan (baselines, metrics, ablations) are clearly presented. The expected outcomes are quantified. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism of the 'modified attention mechanism' conditioned on interventions and the exact derivation of the causal graph 'G' for the sparsity penalty, but these do not significantly hinder overall understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory originality. While the core idea of integrating causality and counterfactual reasoning into world models is actively being explored (as evidenced by the literature review, including papers like Doe & Smith [Ref 3/5], Johnson & Brown [Ref 6], White & Green [Ref 7], etc.), the specific proposed approach offers some novelty. This includes the hybrid Transformer+SSM architecture for temporal dynamics combined with an intervention-aware prediction head trained explicitly on both factual and counterfactual latent state prediction objectives. The novelty lies more in the specific integration and implementation strategy rather than a fundamentally groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established foundations (world models, Transformers, SSMs, causal inference concepts like interventions/counterfactuals). The proposed methodology, including the hybrid architecture and dual-loss training objective (factual prediction + counterfactual KL divergence), is logical. The evaluation plan uses appropriate metrics (SHD, intervention accuracy) and relevant baselines. However, some technical details could be more rigorous: the parameterization of the distributions for the KL divergence isn't specified, and the mechanism for extracting the causal graph 'G' from attention weights for the sparsity penalty lacks detailed justification and definition."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing benchmarks (CoPhy, RoboNet) and proposes generating synthetic data, both standard practices. The model architecture, while complex (Transformer+SSM hybrid), is within the scope of current deep learning capabilities, assuming adequate computational resources. The training procedure (dual objective, interventions) and evaluation plan are standard and implementable. Potential risks, such as effective balancing of loss terms and ensuring generalization, are typical for this type of research but do not render the proposal infeasible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical limitation of current world models – their lack of robust causal understanding – which is crucial for safety, generalization, and reliability in high-stakes applications like robotics, autonomous systems, and healthcare. Successfully integrating causal reasoning via counterfactual prediction could lead to major advancements in AI adaptability and decision-making. The research aligns perfectly with the workshop's themes and has the potential for substantial impact on the field."
