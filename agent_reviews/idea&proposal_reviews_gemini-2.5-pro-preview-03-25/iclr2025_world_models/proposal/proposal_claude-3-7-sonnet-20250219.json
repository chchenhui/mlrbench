        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's interest in 'causal understanding' within world models, utilizing relevant architectures (Transformers, SSMs) mentioned in the scope. The methodology clearly expands on the core research idea of using counterfactual prediction to induce causality in latent states. Furthermore, it positions itself effectively within the context of the provided literature, citing relevant works (CoPhy, DCM) and addressing the key challenges identified, such as learning causal representations and generalizing to unseen interventions. The proposal comprehensively integrates all provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the hypothesis. The methodology section is meticulously structured, detailing the architecture (including mathematical formulations for attention mechanisms), data requirements, multi-phase training procedure with specific loss functions, a step-by-step algorithm, and a comprehensive evaluation plan. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly articulated. While the exact derivation of the Causal Attention mask (M_I) from the intervention (I) could be slightly more explicit, this is a minor detail in an otherwise perfectly understandable and logically structured proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality and innovation. While the idea of using counterfactuals for causal reasoning exists (as shown in the literature review), its specific integration into the latent dynamics learning of a world model through a dedicated Causal Intervention Module (CIM) and Causal Attention mechanism is novel. The proposed hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture tailored for this task and the combined training objective (predictive, counterfactual, contrastive causal) represent a fresh approach within the world model paradigm. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on embedding causal structure directly into the world model's state representation via counterfactual prediction, rather than treating causal inference as a separate downstream task or solely focusing on specific outcome predictions."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established concepts from causal inference (Pearl's hierarchy, interventions) and deep learning (Transformers, SSMs, contrastive learning). The core hypothesis – that training on counterfactual predictions can induce causally structured latent representations – is plausible and theoretically motivated. The proposed methodology, including the architecture, loss functions, and training procedure, is technically coherent. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and includes appropriate metrics, baselines, and ablations. A minor weakness is the lack of full detail on how the Causal Attention mask is derived from intervention signals, but the overall technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current machine learning technology and resources. Generating interventional data in the proposed simulated environments (MuJoCo, PyBullet, Atari, ProcGen) is standard practice. Implementing the hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and the proposed training objectives is achievable using existing deep learning frameworks. The evaluation plan uses standard or readily implementable techniques. The main challenge, acknowledged in the limitations, is the potential computational cost associated with training complex models on large datasets including counterfactual samples. However, this is a common challenge in deep learning research and does not render the proposal impractical. The plan is realistic with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current world models – their reliance on correlation rather than causation – which restricts their robustness, generalization, and applicability in scenarios requiring reasoning about interventions (e.g., robotics, healthcare, autonomous driving). Successfully developing causality-aware world models would represent a major advancement, potentially leading to more trustworthy, reliable, and interpretable AI systems. The research directly contributes to the key theme of 'causal understanding' highlighted in the workshop scope and has the potential for substantial scientific and practical impact across multiple domains."
