    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem highlighted in the task description (simplistic assumptions about human feedback in AI alignment) and the workshop's theme (understanding human feedback, cognitive effort). The methodology and objectives perfectly reflect the research idea (modeling cognitive effort via hierarchical Bayesian IRL). It also acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as modeling cognitive effort and collecting data under varying conditions. The focus on IRL, cognitive science integration, and AI alignment fits squarely within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, significance, and overall research plan are presented logically. The methodology section outlines the steps clearly, including data collection, model development (hierarchical Bayesian inference with Gaussian Processes), training, validation, and bias mitigation. Evaluation metrics are specified. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mathematical formulation of the effort model or the definition of the 'Bias Index', but these are acceptable omissions at the proposal stage. Overall, the proposal is easy to understand and follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While IRL and modeling human behavior are established fields, the specific idea of explicitly modeling *cognitive effort* as a latent variable within a hierarchical Bayesian IRL framework to *jointly* infer effort levels and preferences for robust AI alignment is innovative. It moves beyond standard IRL assumptions by incorporating concepts from cognitive science (bounded rationality, effort-accuracy trade-offs) in a principled way. This combination addresses a recognized gap and offers a fresh perspective compared to the cited literature, which focuses on different aspects of IRL or interpretability."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established methodologies like Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian inference (specifically Hierarchical Models, Gaussian Processes, and Variational Inference). The motivation, rooted in the limitations of current human feedback models and insights from cognitive science, is well-founded. The proposed experimental design (varying task complexity/constraints) is appropriate for studying effort. The plan includes validation and bias mitigation steps. While the technical details of the model implementation are not fully specified (as expected in a proposal), the chosen techniques are suitable for the problem, suggesting a rigorous approach. The soundness depends on careful implementation and validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Implementing hierarchical Bayesian models with Gaussian Processes and variational inference requires significant technical expertise and computational resources. Designing and conducting human subject experiments to collect behavioral data under varying cognitive load requires careful planning, resources for participant recruitment, and potentially ethical review board approval. While these steps are standard in ML and behavioral research, they are non-trivial. The interdisciplinary nature adds complexity. However, the plan is generally realistic, uses established (though complex) methods, and the risks seem manageable within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and timely problem in AI safety and alignment: the unreliability of human feedback due to cognitive limitations like effort. Improving the robustness of preference inference by accounting for effort could lead to major advancements in methods like RLHF, making AI systems safer and better aligned with true human intentions, especially in complex real-world applications (e.g., healthcare, education). Identifying effort-related biases is also a valuable contribution. The interdisciplinary approach strengthens its potential impact across ML and cognitive science."
