    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call to challenge simplistic assumptions (like perfect rationality) in human feedback models for AI alignment by focusing on cognitive effort, a concept explicitly mentioned under relevant topics (Cognitive Science, Bounded Rationality). The methodology builds directly on the research idea, proposing a cognitive effort-aware Bayesian IRL framework. It also acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as modeling cognitive effort, data collection under varying conditions, and integrating bounded rationality."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. The mathematical formulation of the utility function and the Bayesian inference process is presented clearly. The experimental plan, including data collection, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is specific and understandable. There is very little ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While IRL and Bayesian methods are established, and cognitive effort is studied in cognitive science, the specific integration of an explicit cognitive effort cost within a hierarchical Bayesian IRL framework to improve AI alignment by modeling human feedback imperfections is innovative. It moves beyond standard rationality assumptions common in IRL (as noted in the survey) and offers a more nuanced approach than simply treating deviations as noise. It distinguishes itself from the cited works like AIRL (robustness to dynamics) and Hybrid IRL (sample efficiency)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical foundations (IRL, Bayesian inference, decision theory, bounded rationality). The proposed methodology, including the effort-penalized utility function, softmax choice rule, and hierarchical Bayesian modeling, is appropriate and well-justified for the problem. The use of HMC for inference is suitable. The validation plan is comprehensive. A minor point is that the proposal doesn't explicitly state how the effort cost function C(a) will be defined or estimated (e.g., based on task features, learned), but this is a detail that can be elaborated later. The overall technical approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Synthetic data generation is straightforward. The real-world behavioral experiment (N=200) is standard in cognitive science and HCI, requiring resources but being methodologically established. Manipulating cognitive load and measuring responses are common practices. Implementing the hierarchical Bayesian model using HMC is feasible with standard software packages (Stan, PyMC), although potentially computationally intensive for very large datasets (scalability is noted as a goal). Access to baseline implementations (AIRL, etc.) is likely possible. The project requires expertise in ML, Bayesian methods, and experimental design, but seems achievable within a typical research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and acknowledged limitation in current AI alignment methods â€“ the oversimplified modeling of human feedback. By incorporating cognitive effort, it tackles a fundamental aspect of human decision-making, potentially leading to more robust and reliable AI systems, especially in safety-critical or effort-intensive domains like healthcare and education. Success would represent a substantial contribution to AI alignment, human-AI interaction, and the integration of cognitive science insights into ML, directly aligning with the workshop's goals."
