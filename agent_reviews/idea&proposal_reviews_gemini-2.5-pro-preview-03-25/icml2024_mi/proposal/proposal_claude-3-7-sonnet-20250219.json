    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of understanding human feedback for AI alignment by focusing on cognitive effort, a key aspect of bounded rationality mentioned in the task description and research idea. The proposal elaborates significantly on the research idea, providing a detailed methodology that incorporates concepts like bounded rationality and inverse reinforcement learning, which are relevant topics mentioned in the task description and literature review. It also explicitly aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as modeling cognitive effort and integrating bounded rationality frameworks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the research objectives concisely. The methodology section is well-structured, detailing the theoretical model with mathematical formulations, the computational inference approach (hierarchical Bayesian inference, approximated with variational inference), and a comprehensive experimental validation plan with specific experiments, manipulations, and metrics. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly articulated. While minor details like the exact neural network architecture or the specific functional form of the heuristic function are not fully specified, this is typical for a proposal, and the overall plan is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While concepts like bounded rationality, cognitive effort, and preference learning exist independently, the core novelty lies in their synthesis: explicitly modeling cognitive effort as a dynamic variable within a hierarchical Bayesian preference learning framework specifically for robust AI alignment. This approach directly challenges the simplistic assumptions common in RLHF and related fields. The joint inference of latent preferences and cognitive effort levels, conditioned on task complexity, represents a fresh perspective distinct from standard IRL or preference models that often use a single, static rationality parameter. The proposal clearly distinguishes its approach from prior work implicitly by addressing the gap of cognitive effort modeling."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations from cognitive science (bounded rationality) and machine learning (preference learning, IRL, Bayesian inference). The proposed mathematical extension of the rational choice model to include effort is conceptually sound. The hierarchical Bayesian formulation for joint inference is appropriate, and the use of variational inference is a standard and practical approximation technique. The experimental design is well-thought-out, including controls, multiple measurement types, comparison to baselines, and ground truth validation. Minor weaknesses include the specific functional form chosen for the effort model (which might be an oversimplification needing empirical validation) and potential challenges in objectively quantifying task complexity 'c' and ensuring identifiability between effort and preference, but the overall approach is methodologically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing methods and technology, but presents some moderate challenges. The computational aspects (variational inference with NNs) are standard. Conducting online human studies with cognitive load manipulations (time pressure, task complexity) is achievable. However, reliably measuring cognitive effort (self-reports can be noisy, physiological measures add complexity/cost), establishing a convincing 'ground truth' for preferences, and ensuring the model can reliably disentangle effort from preference based on behavioral data alone might be difficult. The plan is generally realistic, but successful execution depends on careful experimental design and potentially overcoming identifiability issues during modeling. The scale of the proposed experiments (200 participants + 50 for ground truth) is reasonable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and often-overlooked limitation in current human-AI alignment approaches â€“ the failure to account for cognitive effort and bounded rationality in human feedback. Successfully developing a framework that can infer true preferences from effort-constrained feedback would represent a major advancement for building more robust, reliable, and genuinely aligned AI systems. The potential impact spans numerous high-stakes domains (healthcare, education, autonomous systems, LLM alignment) where misinterpreting human input due to cognitive limitations can have severe consequences. The research bridges AI, cognitive science, and behavioral economics, promising substantial theoretical and practical contributions."
