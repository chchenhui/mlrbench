        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme by challenging simplistic assumptions in human feedback models (rationality, consistency) and proposing a method grounded in cognitive science (bounded rationality, cognitive effort). The methodology and objectives perfectly match the research idea, aiming to develop a cognitive effort-aware model using hierarchical Bayesian inference. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as modeling cognitive effort, integrating bounded rationality, and addressing biases."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction effectively sets the context and motivation. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The methodology section provides a detailed and logical explanation of the theoretical framework (bounded rationality, KL divergence), the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model, the inference technique (MCMC), and the experimental design (data, metrics, baselines). Mathematical formulations are included and explained concisely. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated, making the proposal easy to understand and follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like bounded rationality, Bayesian inference, GPs, and IRL are established, the specific contribution lies in their synthesis to create a *cognitive effort-aware* feedback model for AI alignment. Explicitly modeling and jointly inferring human preferences *and* cognitive effort levels (parameterized by \\\\beta derived from information-theoretic bounded rationality) within a hierarchical Bayesian framework applied to IRL/RLHF contexts is a fresh perspective. It moves beyond standard models that implicitly assume uniform effort or perfect rationality, offering a distinct approach compared to the cited literature which focuses on hybrid data, general interpretability, or adversarial robustness."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations from cognitive science (bounded rationality, free-energy principle) and machine learning (Bayesian inference, GPs, MCMC). The mathematical formulation connecting effort to KL divergence and using it within a choice model likelihood is well-justified by the cited theoretical work. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian structure is appropriate for inferring latent variables (preferences R, effort \\\\beta). Using MCMC (specifically HMC) for inference and sparse GPs for scalability are standard and robust techniques. Minor points requiring careful execution include prior specification (GP kernel, Gamma parameters) and ensuring MCMC convergence, but the overall methodological approach is well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Implementing hierarchical Bayesian models with GPs and MCMC requires significant technical expertise and computational resources, although using sparse GPs mitigates scalability concerns. Data collection, especially the custom experiments manipulating cognitive load or time pressure, requires careful design, ethical approval, and resources for participant recruitment and compensation. While feasible, achieving reliable manipulation of effort and collecting sufficient high-quality data is non-trivial. The MCMC inference step can be computationally intensive and may require careful tuning for convergence. Overall, the plan is realistic but requires dedicated effort and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and acknowledged limitation in current AI alignment approaches: the failure to account for cognitive factors like effort in human feedback. Successfully developing and validating such a model could lead to major advancements in AI safety by creating systems that are more robust to realistic human input. The potential impact spans multiple domains (healthcare, education, robotics) where misinterpreting effortful or heuristic-based feedback can have serious consequences. Furthermore, it promises valuable contributions to the theoretical understanding of human-AI interaction by bridging machine learning and cognitive science."
