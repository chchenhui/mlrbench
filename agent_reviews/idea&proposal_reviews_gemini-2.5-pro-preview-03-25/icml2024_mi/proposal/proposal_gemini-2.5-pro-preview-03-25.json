        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for a better understanding of human feedback beyond simplistic rationality assumptions, focusing specifically on cognitive effort as suggested. It incorporates Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and concepts like bounded rationality, which are highlighted topics. The objectives and methodology directly stem from the research idea, aiming to develop a cognitive effort-aware model using Bayesian inference. Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as modeling effort, data collection under varying conditions, and identifying biases."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, significance, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The core concept of CE-IRL is explained well, including the motivation from bounded rationality and the proposed mathematical extensions to standard IRL. The experimental plan, including data collection (simulated and human) and validation steps, is clearly outlined. While the exact functional form of the effort cost function remains to be determined (which is reasonable at the proposal stage), the overall research plan is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While IRL, Bayesian inference, and bounded rationality are established concepts, the specific integration of cognitive effort as a quantifiable cost, jointly inferred with the reward function within an IRL framework specifically for AI alignment, represents a significant and novel contribution. Standard IRL/RLHF often ignores or simplifies this aspect. The proposed CE-IRL framework, particularly the joint Bayesian inference of reward and effort parameters (\\theta, \\phi), offers a fresh perspective distinct from prior work cited and common practices in the field. It's not entirely groundbreaking in the sense of inventing a new field, but it's a highly innovative application and synthesis of ideas."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (bounded rationality, MaxEnt IRL, Bayesian inference) and cites relevant literature appropriately. The proposed methodology (CE-IRL formulation, hierarchical Bayesian inference using MCMC/VI) is technically sound and well-justified for the problem. The experimental design for validation (using simulated and human data, comparing against baselines, checking correlations with effort proxies) is comprehensive. A minor weakness is the inherent difficulty in perfectly defining and measuring 'cognitive effort', meaning the proposed C_{\\phi} function will necessarily be an approximation, but the plan to explore and validate this is reasonable. The technical formulations presented are conceptually correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required expertise (IRL, Bayesian methods, behavioral experiments) and tools (MCMC/VI software, experiment platforms) are standard in well-equipped ML research environments. The data collection plan, involving simulated data and online human experiments, is practical. Implementing the CE-IRL model is challenging but achievable. Potential risks include the difficulty in precisely modeling the effort cost function C_{\\phi}, potential computational demands of Bayesian inference (especially MCMC), and possible challenges in statistically disentangling effort from reward parameters. However, these are manageable research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and often overlooked limitation in current AI alignment approaches â€“ the assumption of effortless, rational human feedback. Improving the robustness of preference inference by accounting for cognitive effort has major implications for AI safety and reliability across various domains (LLMs, robotics, healthcare). The work promises theoretical advancements in understanding human feedback (mechanistic interpretability) and practical benefits for building better-aligned AI. It also fosters valuable interdisciplinary connections between ML, cognitive science, and behavioral economics."
