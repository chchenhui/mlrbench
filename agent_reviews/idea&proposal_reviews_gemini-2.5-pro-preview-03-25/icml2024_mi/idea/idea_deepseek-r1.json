        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (Workshop on Mechanistic Interpretability). The workshop explicitly calls for work that challenges simplistic assumptions in human feedback models (like rationality) and aims for a better understanding of human feedback for AI alignment. The idea directly addresses this by proposing a model that incorporates cognitive effort (a deviation from perfect rationality) into human feedback modeling, drawing from listed relevant topics like RLHF, IRL, Behavioral Economics (Bounded Rationality), and Cognitive Science (Effort in Decision-Making). It directly contributes to the workshop's goals of discussing shortcomings of current models and exploring future directions for better AI alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the motivation (limitations of current models ignoring effort), the main proposal (cognitive effort-aware feedback model using bounded rationality and Bayesian inference), the methodology (joint inference of preferences and effort), and the expected outcomes (improved inference, bias identification). The concepts are explained concisely, and the research direction is unambiguous. Minor details about the specific mathematical formulation could be added, but the core concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While RLHF, IRL, and Bayesian methods are known, the explicit integration of cognitive effort dynamics, drawing from bounded rationality frameworks in cognitive science, into these AI alignment techniques is innovative. Most existing work treats feedback noise generically, whereas this proposal aims to model a specific, psychologically grounded source of noise/bias (effort) and its trade-offs. The joint inference of preferences and effort levels via hierarchical Bayesian modeling represents a fresh approach within this context, combining insights from multiple fields in a novel way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core techniques (Bayesian inference, IRL, behavioral experiments) are established. However, operationalizing 'cognitive effort' within a formal model, designing experiments that reliably manipulate and measure effort's impact on feedback relevant to AI alignment tasks, and implementing potentially complex hierarchical Bayesian models require significant expertise and careful design. Collaboration between ML and cognitive science researchers would likely be necessary. Data collection under controlled conditions is achievable but requires careful planning. Overall, it's feasible with existing methods but requires considerable effort and interdisciplinary integration."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and often overlooked limitation in current human feedback models used for AI alignment â€“ the assumption of effortless, rational feedback. Understanding and modeling the impact of cognitive effort could lead to substantially more robust AI systems that can better interpret real-world human feedback, which is often noisy and biased due to cognitive limitations. This is particularly important for safety-critical applications (healthcare, autonomous systems) where misaligned AI can have severe consequences. Success would represent a major advancement in building more realistic and reliable human-AI alignment systems."
