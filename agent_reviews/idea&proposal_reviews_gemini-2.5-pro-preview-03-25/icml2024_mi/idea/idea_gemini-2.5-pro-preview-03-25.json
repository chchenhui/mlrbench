        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of understanding and improving human feedback models for AI alignment, specifically challenging the simplistic assumptions often made in RLHF. It explicitly tackles the issue of cognitive factors (effort) influencing human feedback, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's interest in Behavioral Economics and Cognitive Science perspectives on human decision-making within the context of AI alignment and RLHF. The idea proposes a novel approach to model human feedback more realistically, directly contributing to the workshop's goals of discussing shortcomings of current models and exploring promising future directions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly articulates the problem with existing RLHF assumptions regarding cognitive effort. The proposed solution – incorporating effort proxies into the preference model – is well-defined. It specifies potential methods (response times, self-reports, complexity estimates) and the target model type (modified Bradley-Terry). The expected outcome (improved alignment robustness) is clearly stated. While the precise mathematical formulation of the effort-aware model isn't detailed, this level of abstraction is appropriate for a research idea summary. The core concept is immediately understandable and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While RLHF and modeling noisy human feedback are existing areas, explicitly incorporating *cognitive effort* as a factor within the preference model itself, using proxies like response time or complexity, is a novel approach within the standard RLHF framework. It moves beyond simply acknowledging noise to modeling a specific *source* of noise/bias grounded in cognitive science. This integration of concepts from cognitive science (effort cost) directly into the mechanics of RLHF preference modeling offers a fresh perspective compared to typical approaches that often treat annotators or feedback sources uniformly or model noise agnostically."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Collecting proxies like response times is straightforward. Self-reported difficulty is also standard practice. Estimating comparison complexity computationally is possible but might require careful design depending on the domain. Modifying probabilistic preference models (like Bradley-Terry) to incorporate additional variables (effort estimates) is mathematically achievable. Integrating the modified reward model into an RLHF pipeline is conceptually sound. The main challenge lies in the accurate *measurement* and *modeling* of cognitive effort – proxies can be noisy, and the exact functional form relating effort to preference noise/bias needs careful theoretical grounding and empirical validation. This requires careful experimental design and potentially significant data collection."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Improving the robustness and accuracy of AI alignment through better human feedback modeling is a critical challenge in AI safety and usability. RLHF is a dominant paradigm, particularly for LLMs, and addressing a fundamental limitation related to the cognitive state of human labelers could lead to substantial improvements. If successful, this approach could produce AI systems that better capture nuanced human preferences, especially in complex domains where cognitive load is likely to affect feedback quality. This directly contributes to the development of more reliable and user-centric AI, aligning well with the workshop's emphasis on better alignment through improved feedback understanding."
