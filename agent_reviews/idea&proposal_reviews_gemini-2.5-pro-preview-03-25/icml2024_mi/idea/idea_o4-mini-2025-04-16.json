    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on understanding human feedback models for AI alignment, criticizing simplistic assumptions (rationality, unbiasedness) in methods like RLHF. The research idea directly tackles this by proposing an RLHF framework that explicitly models bounded rationality, cognitive biases, and effort, drawing from behavioral economics and cognitive science, which are listed as relevant topics. It aims to create better feedback models and improve alignment, matching the workshop's core goals."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of standard RLHF assumptions), outlines the main steps (calibration tasks, parameter estimation, Bayesian reward modeling, policy optimization), specifies the validation domain (language tasks), and lists expected outcomes. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact form of the bounded rationality model or the specifics of the 'effort score' collection, but the overall concept and proposed pipeline are well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While RLHF and Bayesian methods are established, the core novelty lies in formally integrating models of bounded rationality (capturing individual noise, satisficing, specific biases like anchoring) directly into the RLHF reward inference process. Estimating these parameters via dedicated calibration tasks and using them to 'debias' feedback within a hierarchical Bayesian framework offers a fresh perspective compared to standard RLHF approaches that often use simpler preference models or assume uniform rationality."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Designing effective calibration tasks to reliably estimate individual cognitive parameters (noise, thresholds, biases) requires careful experimental design. Collecting meaningful 'effort scores' could also be difficult. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian model might be computationally complex to implement and train, likely requiring advanced inference techniques (MCMC, VI) and significant computational resources. While the components exist, integrating them effectively poses a considerable engineering and research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and acknowledged limitation in current AI alignment techniques (RLHF), namely the unrealistic assumptions about human feedback. Successfully modeling and correcting for bounded rationality could lead to more robust, reliable, and genuinely aligned AI systems, particularly large language models. Improving the interpretability of how human feedback influences the model is also a major contribution. This research directly tackles core issues in AI safety and human-AI interaction."
