        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of understanding human decision-making for AI alignment by challenging the simplistic rationality assumption in Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), a key method mentioned under 'Learning from Demonstrations'. It explicitly incorporates concepts from 'Behavioral Economics (Bounded Rationality)' and 'Cognitive Science (Effort in Decision-Making)', both listed as relevant topics. Furthermore, it aims to develop better computational models of human feedback to improve 'Human-AI Alignment' and 'AI Safety', aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals and scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (flawed rationality assumption in IRL) and the proposed solution (integrating bounded rationality models). The core components – using bounded rationality concepts, incorporating cognitive load data (neuroimaging/eye-tracking), employing Bayesian inference, and benchmarking – are stated. However, the specific mathematical models for biases or the exact method for integrating cognitive load data into the Bayesian framework could be more detailed for perfect clarity. Minor refinements would enhance precision, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While IRL and bounded rationality are established fields, the proposed integration is innovative. Specifically, the plan to explicitly model cognitive biases and effort constraints using cognitive load data (neuroimaging/eye-tracking) within an IRL framework, and jointly inferring reward functions and human 'noise parameters' via Bayesian inference, represents a significant departure from standard IRL approaches that often assume optimality or use simpler noise models. This combination offers a fresh perspective on modeling human suboptimal demonstrations for alignment."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core IRL and Bayesian inference components are standard. However, incorporating neuroimaging or eye-tracking data substantially increases experimental complexity, cost, and data processing requirements. Developing and validating accurate, yet tractable, computational models of specific cognitive biases and integrating them effectively with cognitive load data within the IRL framework is non-trivial. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation, especially the data collection and integration part, requires considerable effort, specialized resources, and expertise, making it moderately challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a fundamental limitation in current human-AI alignment approaches – the unrealistic assumption of human rationality in methods like IRL. Misinterpreting suboptimal human demonstrations can lead to misaligned and potentially unsafe AI systems. By proposing a method to recover more accurate reward functions from realistic human behavior, this research could lead to major advancements in AI safety, particularly in human-in-the-loop systems and high-stakes domains like robotics and healthcare. It directly addresses a critical problem highlighted in the workshop description."
