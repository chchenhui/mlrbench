    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GAIED workshop's GAI→ED thrust by proposing an AI system (Socratic partner) for a novel educational scenario (collaborative inquiry) and touches upon ED→GAI through its focus on evaluation frameworks and aligning AI with pedagogical goals (metacognition). The methodology and objectives are a direct and logical extension of the research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to build upon or address the limitations of prior work cited in the literature review (SocratiQ, SPL, EducationQ), demonstrating a deep understanding of the context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. The methodology section provides specific details on data sources, annotation, base models, prompt engineering examples, fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, loss function), and a comprehensive experimental validation plan including baselines, metrics, and user study design. While the components of the question scoring function could be further elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the concept of using LLMs for Socratic dialogue exists (SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL), this proposal distinguishes itself by focusing specifically on simulating a 'peer learner' role emphasizing inquiry over instruction, rather than a tutor. Key novel elements include the proposed question prioritization module designed to enhance Socratic questioning quality and the robust evaluation framework targeting specific metacognitive skills (self-correction, reflective thinking). It also innovatively incorporates insights from recent work like EducationQ by focusing on pedagogical fine-tuning over raw model scale. The combination of these elements offers a fresh perspective, though it builds upon an established line of research."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in established educational principles (Socratic method, collaborative learning, metacognition) and leverages standard, well-justified ML techniques (Llama-3/Mistral-7B, LoRA fine-tuning, prompt engineering). The proposed methodology is robust, particularly the experimental validation plan which includes appropriate baselines, diverse metrics (quantitative and qualitative), and a detailed user study design. The technical formulations (loss function, scoring function structure) are correctly presented. The approach demonstrates a strong understanding of both AI techniques and educational considerations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Using pre-trained models and LoRA makes the core model development practical. Prompt engineering is standard. However, curating and annotating a high-quality dataset of Socratic dialogues is non-trivial and requires significant effort and expertise; reliance on synthetic data also requires careful validation. Conducting a user study with 120 participants, including recruitment, execution, and detailed qualitative/quantitative analysis, is resource-intensive. Developing truly robust metrics for metacognitive skills is inherently complex. While achievable within a well-funded research project, these aspects introduce moderate implementation risks and dependencies."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current AI tutors – their tendency to provide answers rather than foster deeper learning skills like critical thinking and self-reflection. Developing an AI partner that effectively promotes metacognition through Socratic inquiry could represent a major advancement in educational technology. The research directly contributes to the GAIED workshop's goals, particularly GAI→ED. The expected outcomes, including technical contributions (fine-tuning framework, evaluation tools) and empirical insights into AI-driven pedagogy, have substantial potential to influence future AIED research and practice, potentially improving educational equity and AI alignment with human values."
