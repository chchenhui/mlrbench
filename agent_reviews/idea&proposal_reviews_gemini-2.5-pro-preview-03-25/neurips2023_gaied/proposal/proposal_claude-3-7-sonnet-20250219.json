        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GAI→ED thrust of the GAIED workshop by proposing a novel human-machine collaborative system (SAIL) designed to improve educational technology beyond traditional tutoring. It incorporates the core research idea of using generative AI as a Socratic partner for collaborative inquiry, focusing on metacognition. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to build upon the cited literature (SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL), positioning itself within the current research landscape and addressing identified challenges like simulating authentic dialogue and evaluating effectiveness. The objectives and methodology are directly derived from the idea and informed by the literature and workshop goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected impact. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The methodology section provides substantial detail on the system architecture (including an algorithm sketch), data collection, model training (including loss function components), implementation phases, and a comprehensive evaluation plan. The language is precise and academic. While minor details like specific loss function formulations or hyperparameter values are omitted (as expected in a proposal), the overall plan and rationale are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation, though it builds upon an existing line of research identified in the literature review (Socratic AI tutors like SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL). The novelty lies in: 1) The explicit and central focus on fostering *metacognitive skills* through a dedicated module and evaluation metrics, going beyond general critical thinking. 2) Framing the AI as a *peer-like learning partner* for collaborative inquiry, distinct from a traditional tutor role. 3) The detailed design of the adaptive Socratic strategy engine and the multi-faceted training approach (prompting, fine-tuning with custom loss, RLHF) tailored for Socratic dialogue quality. 4) The rigorous comparative evaluation specifically targeting metacognitive gains. While not introducing an entirely new paradigm, it offers significant, well-justified advancements and refinements over existing Socratic AI systems."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is well-grounded in established educational theories (socio-constructivism, Socratic method, metacognition). The proposed methodology is robust, incorporating state-of-the-art techniques like LLM fine-tuning, RLHF, and a comprehensive mixed-methods evaluation design (RCT, pre/post tests, think-alouds, dialogue analysis). The system architecture is logical, and the adaptive algorithm provides a clear conceptual basis for personalization. The inclusion of specific evaluation metrics and analytical approaches (ANCOVA, NLP, thematic analysis) further strengthens the rigor. While the implementation of certain components (e.g., the custom Socratic loss, accurate learner modeling) will be challenging, the overall technical and experimental approach is well-founded and aligns with best practices in AIEd research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, although ambitious. It leverages existing LLMs and standard training techniques (fine-tuning, RLHF). The proposed data collection (curation, annotation, synthesis) is labor-intensive but achievable. The system development involves complex integration but is broken down logically. The experimental evaluation (150 participants, mixed methods) requires significant resources and coordination but is standard for rigorous educational research. The iterative refinement plan acknowledges the complexity and allows for adjustments. Key risks include achieving truly authentic Socratic interaction and the effort required for data/evaluation, but these seem manageable within a well-resourced project. The plan is detailed and realistic."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current AI tutors, which often focus on information delivery rather than fostering deeper cognitive and metacognitive skills. By aiming to develop an AI partner for Socratic dialogue and collaborative inquiry, it has the potential to significantly advance AIEd, offering a tool that promotes critical thinking and self-regulated learning. Success could lead to more effective educational technologies, democratize access to inquiry-based learning, and provide valuable design principles for future human-AI collaboration in education. The research directly contributes to the GAI→ED thrust and offers insights relevant to ED→GAI by promoting genuine learning processes. The potential impact on educational practice and theory is substantial."
