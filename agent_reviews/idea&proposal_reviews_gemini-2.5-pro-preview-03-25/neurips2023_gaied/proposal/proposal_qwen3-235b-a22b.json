        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GAIED workshop's GAI→ED thrust by proposing a novel human-machine collaborative system (a Socratic peer) to enhance education (critical thinking). It also implicitly touches on the ED→GAI thrust by aiming to shift AI from answer provision to cognitive scaffolding. The proposal meticulously elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the methodology and evaluation plan. Furthermore, it effectively positions itself against the cited literature (SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL), explicitly aiming to address identified gaps like the lack of authentic peer simulation and robust evaluation frameworks, which were highlighted as key challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The methodology section is detailed, logically structured (Data, Model, Interaction, Evaluation), and includes specific techniques (LLaMA-3, SFT, RLHF, PPO), metrics (EQ, SCR, MRS), and even mathematical formulations for loss and reward functions. The rationale, significance, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and persuasively. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving minimal room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using AI for Socratic dialogue isn't entirely new (as evidenced by SocratiQ, EduChat, SPL), the core novelty lies in framing the agent as a *collaborative peer* rather than a traditional tutor. This conceptual shift, focusing on inquiry and mutual exploration over guided instruction, is a fresh perspective. Additionally, the proposed RLHF reward function tailored for peer-like interaction (including metacognitive stimulation) and the specific set of evaluation metrics (EQ, SCR, MRS) focused on collaborative reasoning and self-reflection contribute to the novelty, distinguishing it from existing systems and evaluation approaches like EducationQ."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on established pedagogical principles (Socratic method, collaborative learning) and employs standard, state-of-the-art ML techniques (LLaMA-3, SFT, RLHF with PPO). The methodology is well-described, including data handling, model architecture, interaction design, and a robust experimental plan with appropriate statistical analysis. The technical formulations provided are correct. Minor weaknesses exist in the inherent difficulty of perfectly simulating nuanced peer dialogue and the potential complexity of implementing the adaptive strategy based on reasoning depth and cognitive preferences, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on accessible technologies (LLaMA-3, standard fine-tuning libraries) and established research methods (user studies). The planned data curation, while requiring effort, seems achievable through the proposed sources. The user study scale (N=200) is ambitious but manageable within a well-resourced research project. Key challenges lie in curating sufficient high-quality *peer* dialogue data and successfully fine-tuning the model to exhibit the desired subtle Socratic peer behavior, rather than defaulting to a tutor role. The implementation of the adaptive personalization component also adds complexity, making the project challenging but realistically achievable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical need in education: fostering critical thinking and metacognitive skills, which traditional methods and current AI tutors often struggle to scale effectively. By exploring a peer-based AI interaction model, it contributes directly to the GAI→ED theme. Success would offer a valuable educational tool and advance the understanding of human-AI collaboration in learning. Furthermore, the focus on cognitive scaffolding over answer provision addresses ED→GAI concerns. The development of novel evaluation metrics for Socratic dialogue quality would also be a substantial contribution to the AIED field."
