        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the GAI→ED thrust by proposing a novel human-machine collaborative system where a generative model acts as a digital peer (Socratic partner) for collaborative inquiry. This fits explicitly under the workshop topic '(GAI→ED) Exploring novel human-machine collaborative systems where generative models play different roles, e.g., as digital tutors, assistants, or peers' and also relates to '(GAI→ED) Exploring the capabilities of generative AI and large-language models in novel educational scenarios'. The idea focuses on enhancing education using generative AI, which is the core theme of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly distinguishes the proposed Socratic partner from traditional AI tutors. The main idea outlines the specific role of the AI (posing questions, challenging assumptions, guiding exploration) and the technical approach (prompting, fine-tuning). The evaluation method (user studies, comparison, metrics) and expected outcome (prototype enhancing metacognitive skills) are explicitly stated, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While AI tutors and Socratic dialogue systems exist, the specific framing of the AI as a 'Socratic learning partner' designed to simulate *peer* interaction focused on inquiry, explicitly contrasting it with answer-providing tutors, is a fresh perspective. The emphasis on fostering self-correction and reflective thinking through guided questioning, rather than knowledge delivery, represents a novel application focus for LLMs in education. It combines existing concepts (LLMs, Socratic method, peer learning simulation) in an innovative way for this specific educational goal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Developing an LLM-based agent using prompting and fine-tuning is standard practice. Conducting user studies for evaluation is also a common research methodology. The main challenges, which are typical for such research, would be curating or generating high-quality educational dialogues emphasizing inquiry for fine-tuning and designing robust prompting strategies to consistently elicit Socratic interaction without reverting to tutoring. However, building and evaluating a prototype, as proposed, is well within the realm of current research capabilities."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of many current educational technologies – the lack of support for deeper learning skills like critical thinking, metacognition, and self-reflection. By aiming to simulate the beneficial aspects of Socratic dialogue and peer inquiry, it tackles a fundamental challenge in education. If successful, such a system could offer a scalable and accessible tool to foster higher-order thinking skills, representing a major advancement beyond simple information delivery or basic skill practice provided by many AI tutors."
