    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the GAIED workshop task description. It directly addresses the development of 'personalized digital tutors' using generative AI, which is explicitly mentioned as an opportunity in the GAI→ED thrust. Furthermore, it emphasizes the development of 'novel prompting and fine-tuning techniques' for safeguarding against bias and incorrect information, directly aligning with a key topic listed under the ED→GAI thrust. The motivation and impact sections also resonate strongly with the workshop's goal of exploring both the opportunities and challenges of generative AI in education."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main idea (broken down into methodology, outcomes, impact), and overall goal are presented logically and are easy to understand. The methodology outlines key steps (data collection, training, evaluation, safeguarding). While specific details about the exact AI models, datasets, or novel techniques are not provided, the level of detail is appropriate for a research idea proposal. Minor ambiguities exist, but the core concept is well-defined."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While AI-powered tutoring systems are not entirely new, the specific focus on leveraging state-of-the-art deep generative models and LLMs for highly adaptive personalization is current. The integration of developing *novel* safeguarding techniques (prompting, fine-tuning) specifically tailored to ensure accuracy, fairness, and authenticity within the personalized tutoring context adds a layer of innovation. However, it builds significantly on existing trends in AIEd and generative models rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking paradigm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Gathering diverse, high-quality educational content and, crucially, student performance data raises significant privacy, ethical (IRB), and logistical hurdles. Training/fine-tuning large generative models demands substantial computational resources and expertise. Developing truly novel and effective safeguarding techniques against bias, inaccuracy, and lack of authenticity is an ongoing and difficult research problem. Continuous evaluation with real students also requires careful planning and deployment infrastructure."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Successfully developing effective personalized digital tutors using generative AI could substantially improve student learning outcomes, engagement, and accessibility. Addressing the critical challenges of accuracy, fairness, and authenticity in AI-generated educational content (as highlighted in the ED→GAI thrust) is crucial for the responsible adoption of these technologies. The research could inform educational practices, policy development, and future AI research in education."
