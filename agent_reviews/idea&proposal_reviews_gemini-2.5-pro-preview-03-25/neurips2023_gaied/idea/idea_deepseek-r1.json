        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the GAIED workshop's task description. It directly addresses the 'ED→GAI' thrust by focusing on a unique challenge in education caused by generative AI (academic integrity) and proposes a technical innovation ('novel safeguarding techniques to validate the authenticity of content') to tackle it. It fits squarely within the specified workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation, the problem (unreliable AI detection), the proposed hybrid solution (content analysis + behavioral metadata), the methodology (multimodal model correlating process and text), the required data, the intended output (authenticity score), and expected outcomes. The concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While AI text detection and behavioral analysis (like keystroke dynamics) exist independently, the proposed integration into a single hybrid, multimodal framework specifically for student assignment authenticity is innovative. Correlating fine-grained writing process patterns (keystrokes, edits, pauses) with final text features using a dedicated model offers a fresh perspective compared to prevalent text-only detectors. It's a novel combination and application of existing techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. While the ML techniques (fine-tuning LLMs, multimodal models) are established, the primary hurdle is the reliable collection of detailed behavioral metadata (keystrokes, edit histories, time-spent) at scale. This requires specialized software integrated into student writing environments, raising major practical, privacy (student consent, data security), and ethical concerns. Acquiring large, diverse datasets with paired text and detailed behavioral logs is also challenging. API integration is feasible but depends on LMS provider cooperation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Academic integrity in the age of generative AI is a critical problem facing educational institutions globally. Current detection methods are often inadequate, leading to fairness issues. A more reliable system that reduces false positives/negatives and considers the writing process could restore trust in assessments, provide valuable insights to educators, and potentially guide policies on AI use. Success would represent a major advancement in assessment validation."
