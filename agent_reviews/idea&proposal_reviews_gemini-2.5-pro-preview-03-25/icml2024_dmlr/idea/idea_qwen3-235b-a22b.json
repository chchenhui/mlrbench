        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea 'AutoCurate' aligns excellently with the workshop's scope and topics. It directly addresses several key areas mentioned in the task description, including 'Model-assisted dataset construction', 'Quality signals for large-scale datasets', 'Data curation', 'Impact of dataset drifts', and touches upon 'Ethical considerations' (fairness, bias detection). The focus on improving data quality for foundation models, potentially across heterogeneous domains, fits perfectly within the workshop's aim to bridge dataset-centric methodologies and foundation model development."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation, main components (meta-learning, model-assisted feedback, active learning), and objectives (cost reduction, quality improvement, fairness) are well-defined. The concept of a self-supervised, model-assisted framework using meta-learning for data curation is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific 'domain-agnostic dataset features' or the precise mechanism of foundation model feedback integration, but the overall research direction is clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While automated data cleaning and quality estimation are existing research areas, AutoCurate proposes a novel synthesis by combining meta-learning across heterogeneous domains, self-supervision, direct feedback from foundation models during meta-training to guide curation actions, and active learning. Using domain-agnostic features learned via meta-learning to predict sample quality and guide curation, specifically penalized by downstream model performance, offers a fresh perspective compared to relying solely on predefined heuristics or isolated quality metrics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training a meta-classifier across heterogeneous data streams requires substantial and diverse data, along with considerable computational resources. Defining truly effective 'domain-agnostic' features is non-trivial. Integrating real-time feedback from even a 'lightweight' foundation model adds complexity to the training loop. While the components (meta-learning, active learning, foundation models) exist, their integration into a robust, scalable 'AutoCurate' system requires significant engineering effort and careful experimental design. It's plausible within a research context but not straightforward."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Data curation is a well-acknowledged bottleneck in developing large-scale, reliable, and fair foundation models. An effective automated or semi-automated system like AutoCurate could drastically reduce costs and effort, improve model performance and robustness, and enhance fairness by identifying and mitigating biases in data. Addressing dataset drift and enabling dynamic adaptation is also crucial. Success in this area would represent a major advancement in data-centric AI and foundation model deployment."
