    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on model-assisted dataset construction for foundation models in new domains, emphasizing data quality, diversity, and ethical considerations. The methodology clearly implements the core research idea of an iterative, diversity-aware feedback loop using clustering, synthetic generation, and active learning. Furthermore, it explicitly incorporates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as bias amplification in feedback loops (Wyllie et al., Taori & Hashimoto) and fairness-aware augmentation (Erfanian et al.). All key elements from the inputs are well-integrated."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is broken down into logical technical sections with relevant equations and techniques (K-means, VAE-GAN, AR, cross-model consistency). The experimental design is well-articulated. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor areas for potential improvement include explicitly defining the initial 'foundation model' type and perhaps providing a visual diagram (referenced as Fig. 1 but not included) to illustrate the iterative loop interaction more clearly. The specific choice for the KL divergence direction in the DC metric could also be briefly justified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like synthetic data generation, active learning, latent space clustering, and fairness techniques (AR) exist, the novelty lies in their synergistic integration into a closed-loop, adaptive framework specifically designed for diversity-aware dataset construction. The iterative refinement based on continuous diversity monitoring (DC, CMC) and targeted interventions (bias-aware generation, active learning validation) distinguishes it from static augmentation or simpler model-assisted approaches. It offers a fresh perspective on proactively managing dataset diversity and quality through model feedback, clearly building upon but extending the cited literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (clustering, generative models, active learning, fairness metrics) and relevant prior work cited in the literature review. The proposed methodology, including K-means for cluster identification, VAE-GAN for generation, AR for fairness, and cross-model consistency for active learning, is technically well-founded. The experimental design is comprehensive, including multiple domains, baselines, relevant metrics, and ablation studies. Technical formulations are generally correct, although the specific formulation of the Distributional Coverage (DC) metric using KL(P_data || P_synthetic) might warrant a brief justification compared to alternatives. The overall approach is methodologically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. It relies on standard ML techniques and frameworks (PyTorch Lightning, Ray), making the core components implementable. However, integrating these into a stable, iterative feedback loop is complex. It requires significant computational resources for training multiple models (foundation model, VAE-GAN, M models for consistency) and processing large datasets. Access to suitable datasets and human annotation resources for the active learning component is crucial. While the plan is realistic, achieving the ambitious quantitative targets (e.g., 30-50% cost reduction) might be challenging and depends heavily on the effectiveness of the proposed methods in practice. The mention of tools for reproducibility and scaling (DVC, Ray) strengthens the feasibility aspect."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of constructing high-quality, diverse datasets, which is a major bottleneck in developing robust and fair foundation models, especially in resource-constrained or specialized domains (biomedical, climate, robotics). By focusing on diversity and integrating fairness considerations (AR), it tackles key ethical challenges in AI. If successful, the framework could lead to substantial improvements in model robustness, reduced annotation costs, and more equitable AI systems. The potential contributions to data-centric AI methodology and ethical data practices are substantial."
