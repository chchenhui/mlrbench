    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric ML, model-assisted dataset construction, quality signals, and ethical considerations for foundation models in new domains. It faithfully implements the core research idea of an adaptive, diversity-aware feedback loop. Furthermore, it explicitly references the provided literature (Wyllie et al., Erfanian et al., Yu et al., Taori & Hashimoto) and positions its objectives to tackle the key challenges identified therein, such as bias amplification, synthetic data quality, and feedback loop stability. The proposed methodology directly reflects the concepts outlined in the idea and aims to solve problems highlighted by the literature and task description."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step description of the iterative framework, including mathematical formulations for key components like the rarity score, active learning criterion, and evaluation metrics (Diversity, Coverage, Quality). The inclusion of pseudocode further enhances clarity. The experimental design is specific regarding datasets, baselines, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing techniques (model-assisted generation, latent space clustering, active learning, feedback loops) into a novel, cohesive framework specifically designed for adaptive dataset construction with an explicit focus on diversity. While individual components are not entirely new, their combination and application to iteratively guide dataset creation by identifying and filling diversity gaps via targeted synthetic generation and active validation is innovative. It distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on this adaptive loop with continuous diversity/quality monitoring, rather than just static augmentation (like Chameleon) or analyzing existing feedback loops (like Wyllie/Taori). The novelty lies in the specific system design and its application."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established methods like K-means clustering, active learning using ensemble uncertainty, synthetic data generation (diffusion), and standard evaluation metrics (entropy, JSD, KL divergence). The mathematical formulations appear correct and appropriate for the stated goals. The iterative framework is logically constructed. A minor point of concern is the step of adding model-predicted high-confidence samples directly to the dataset (D_{t+1}), which carries a risk of reinforcing model biases if not carefully calibrated and validated, potentially conflicting with the goal of mitigating bias amplification identified in the literature review. However, the inclusion of human validation via active learning provides a mechanism to mitigate this. Overall, the methodology is well-justified and technically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML technology and resources. The required components (foundation models like ViT/U-Net, generative models like diffusion, clustering algorithms, active learning frameworks) are available. The experimental plan outlines specific datasets and a manageable scope (seed sizes, annotation budget per iteration). Access to compute resources and human annotators is necessary but standard for this type of research. Potential challenges include tuning the numerous hyperparameters (cluster count K, rarity threshold tau, generation parameters, convergence thresholds), ensuring high-quality synthetic data generation across diverse domains, and the effectiveness of K-means in capturing meaningful diversity in complex latent spaces. However, these are research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses a critical bottleneck in modern machine learning: the creation of high-quality, diverse datasets for training powerful foundation models, especially in emerging and high-stakes domains like biomedicine and climate science where labeled data is scarce. By aiming to reduce annotation costs significantly (30-50%) while improving model robustness and explicitly addressing fairness/bias through diversity monitoring, the research has the potential for major impact. It contributes directly to the data-centric AI paradigm shift and offers a practical methodology that could be widely adopted. The focus on ethical considerations and releasing open benchmarks further enhances its potential impact on the research community and responsible AI development."
