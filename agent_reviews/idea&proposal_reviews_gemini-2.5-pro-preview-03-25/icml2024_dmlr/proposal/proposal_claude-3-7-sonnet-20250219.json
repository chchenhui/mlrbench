    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric ML for foundation models, specifically 'model-assisted dataset construction', 'quality signals', and 'ethical considerations' in 'new domains'. The methodology perfectly reflects the research idea's core concept of an adaptive, iterative framework using diversity-aware feedback loops, synthetic data, and active learning. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles key challenges identified in the literature review, such as bias amplification in feedback loops and the need for quality/diversity in synthetic data, positioning the work effectively within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The introduction sets the stage effectively, research objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology section provides a structured breakdown of the proposed framework with logical steps. Mathematical formulations are included for key components, enhancing precision. The experimental design and expected outcomes are also clearly outlined. Minor areas for improvement include the lack of the referenced Figure 1 (acknowledged in the text) and the need for slightly more detail on the implementation specifics of certain algorithms (e.g., bias estimation, specific augmentation strategies) for full reproducibility, but the overall concept and workflow are readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like model-assisted data generation, active learning, latent space analysis, and bias mitigation exist in the literature, the novelty lies in their specific integration into a cohesive, *adaptive*, closed-loop framework driven by *quantitative diversity metrics* for dataset construction. The explicit focus on systematically identifying and filling diversity gaps via feedback loops, combined with targeted synthetic generation and active human validation for emerging domains, offers a fresh perspective compared to standard model-assisted methods or simpler feedback mechanisms discussed in the literature. It's not entirely groundbreaking in its base technologies but presents an innovative synthesis and application."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established ML concepts like foundation models, latent space embeddings, density estimation (KDE), clustering (DBSCAN), active learning, and synthetic data generation. The methodology follows a logical progression. The use of mathematical notation adds rigor. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further justification or refinement. For instance, the 'counter-bias generation' step (x_{\\\\text{counter}} = g_{\\\\theta}(z, -B)) is conceptually interesting but its practical implementation and effectiveness depend heavily on how bias B is estimated and represented, which isn't fully detailed. Assumptions about the generator's ability to invert bias conditioning need validation. Overall, the approach is well-founded but specific technical formulations might require deeper investigation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant engineering and resource challenges. It requires substantial computational power for iterative foundation model training, access to domain expertise and human validators for the target domains (climate, biomedical, robotics), and potentially large initial unlabeled datasets. Integrating the different components (model training, diversity assessment, generation, validation) into a robust pipeline requires considerable effort. Tuning the hyperparameters for various modules (clustering, KDE, active learning) and ensuring the quality of synthetic data are non-trivial tasks. The experimental plan is ambitious. While achievable with adequate resources and expertise, the complexity and potential cost suggest moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the construction of high-quality, diverse, and unbiased datasets, which is a critical bottleneck for developing robust and fair foundation models, especially in specialized or emerging domains. By proposing a systematic framework to improve dataset diversity and mitigate bias while potentially reducing annotation costs, the research has the potential for major impact. It could lead to methodological advancements in data-centric AI, practical benefits in deploying foundation models more widely and responsibly (e.g., in science, healthcare), and contribute to more ethical AI practices by integrating bias monitoring directly into data creation."
