        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (ICML Duality Principles workshop). It directly addresses the workshop's focus on applying duality principles (specifically Lagrange duality, which is explicitly mentioned in the call) to modern machine learning, particularly for model understanding and explanation in deep learning. It also acknowledges the under-exploration of duality in deep learning, matching the motivation stated in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main steps (formulation, analysis, interpretation), expected outcomes, and potential impact are laid out logically. However, a key ambiguity remains: how exactly the Lagrange dual problem will be formulated and solved for inherently non-convex deep learning models. The description states the step but doesn't elaborate on overcoming the theoretical challenges mentioned even in the workshop call (non-convexity), which slightly reduces clarity on the core methodology."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While Lagrange duality is a well-established principle and sensitivity analysis is a known concept in XAI, the workshop description itself notes that applying Lagrange duality for model explanation is 'not yet fully exploited' in deep learning. Therefore, the novelty lies in the specific application and formalization of this duality principle within the context of modern, complex deep learning models for interpretability, potentially offering new perspectives compared to existing gradient-based or perturbation-based methods. It's not groundbreaking but represents a fresh take on an existing problem using underutilized tools."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is somewhat questionable and presents potential challenges. Standard Lagrange duality applies most directly to convex optimization problems. Deep learning models are highly non-convex. The idea does not specify how this non-convexity will be handled â€“ whether through convex relaxations, local analysis, specific model architectures, or other approximations. Formulating a meaningful and tractable dual problem for a general deep network and analyzing its objective function could be theoretically and computationally demanding. Significant research effort would be needed to overcome these hurdles, making the implementation non-trivial."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Model interpretability (XAI) is a critical area in machine learning research, especially for deploying models in high-stakes domains. Providing a new method for understanding model sensitivity, grounded in the mathematical principle of duality, could offer valuable insights, enhance trust, and facilitate debugging and model improvement. If successful, it would be a meaningful contribution to the XAI field and align well with the goals of making AI more transparent and accountable."
