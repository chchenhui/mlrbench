        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for applications of duality principles (specifically mentioning Lagrange duality) to modern machine learning, particularly for model understanding and explanation in deep learning. The idea directly proposes using Lagrange dual variables derived from local optimization problems to explain deep network predictions, addressing the exact gap ('Lagrange duality can be useful for model explanation... but this is not yet fully exploited') and topics ('Model understanding, explanation and interpretation', 'deep learning', 'Convex relaxations and duality for nonconvex problems') mentioned in the workshop call."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (using duality for robust explanations) and the core concept (local optimization problem, dual variables as sensitivity) are well-defined. It clearly states the goal of deriving feature importance and counterfactuals. However, some minor ambiguities remain regarding the precise formulation of the 'local optimization problem', how 'convex relaxation' would be applied effectively to deep networks, and the specific nature of the 'computationally efficient methods' envisioned for estimating dual variables. These aspects would benefit from further elaboration, but the overall proposal is understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While Lagrange duality and sensitivity analysis are established concepts in optimization, their specific application to generate feature importance and counterfactual explanations for deep learning models by formulating local optimization problems and estimating dual variables appears novel. The task description itself highlights that this specific avenue ('Lagrange duality for model explanation') is underexplored in deep learning. This approach offers a fresh perspective compared to prevalent gradient-based or perturbation-based explanation methods, grounding explanations more formally in optimization theory."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. The primary hurdles are the computational cost of solving (even local) optimization problems for potentially high-dimensional inputs/activations in large deep networks for each explanation, and the theoretical difficulty of applying Lagrange duality rigorously in the non-convex setting of deep learning. The proposal acknowledges this by mentioning 'convex relaxation' and the need for 'computationally efficient methods', but developing effective solutions for these is non-trivial and key to the project's success. Standard tools exist (autodiff, optimizers), but scaling and theoretical validity in non-convex settings are major concerns."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Explainable AI (XAI) is a critical area, and current methods often lack robustness or strong theoretical grounding. This proposal aims to provide explanations derived from duality theory, which could offer more principled and potentially more reliable insights than existing heuristic approaches. If the feasibility challenges can be overcome to produce efficient and theoretically sound methods, this research could lead to meaningful contributions to XAI by introducing a new class of explanation techniques grounded in optimization principles."
