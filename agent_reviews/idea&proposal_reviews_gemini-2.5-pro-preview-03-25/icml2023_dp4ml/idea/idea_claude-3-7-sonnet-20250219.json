    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on applying duality principles (specifically Fenchel duality, mentioned in the task) to modern machine learning, particularly for model understanding and explanation in deep learning. It tackles the identified gap of limited recent work on duality in deep learning and proposes a concrete application within the specified topics."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, core concept (Dual Embedding Networks with primal/dual paths, Fenchel conjugates, duality gap regularizer), and intended benefits (interpretability, sensitivity, counterfactuals) are explained effectively. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise implementation details of the Fenchel conjugate transformations for common activations or the exact form of the regularizer, but the overall proposal is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While duality principles themselves are established, applying them to create parallel, inherently interpretable dual representations *within* the layers of a deep network using Fenchel conjugates appears innovative. It contrasts with common post-hoc interpretability methods by building transparency into the architecture itself. The specific concept of Dual Embedding Networks seems like a fresh approach to leveraging duality for deep learning interpretability."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents potential implementation challenges. Calculating or approximating Fenchel conjugates for arbitrary non-linear activation functions commonly used in deep learning could be complex. Training the network with an additional duality gap regularizer might complicate the optimization process and require careful tuning. While preliminary experiments are mentioned, suggesting initial success, scaling this approach and ensuring computational efficiency (especially the claim of minimal inference overhead) requires further investigation and validation. Significant theoretical and empirical effort might be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Addressing the black-box nature of deep learning with inherently interpretable models is a critical research direction. If DENs can achieve performance comparable to standard networks while providing robust interpretability features (feature importance, sensitivity, counterfactuals) directly from the architecture, it would represent a major advancement in trustworthy AI. The success hinges on practical performance and the quality of interpretations provided."
