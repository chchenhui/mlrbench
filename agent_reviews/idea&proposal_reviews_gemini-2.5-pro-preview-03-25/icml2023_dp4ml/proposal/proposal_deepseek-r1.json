        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for applying duality principles (specifically Lagrange duality) to model explanation in deep learning, tackling the noted underutilization and non-convexity challenges. The proposal meticulously expands on the provided research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology (constrained optimization, dual variables, augmented backpropagation), and expected outcomes. It effectively incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant papers on sensitivity analysis (Wang et al., Pizarroso et al.) and duality (Hwang & Son), and explicitly aims to address identified key challenges like robustness (Key Challenge 5) and non-convexity (Key Challenge 2)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, with understandable objectives and a logical flow. The core concept of using Lagrange duality derived from a perturbation minimization problem is well-articulated. The primal and dual formulations are presented. However, certain key technical aspects lack sufficient detail or justification. Algorithm 1 is high-level, needing more specifics on the dual variable embedding and update computation. The theoretical justification for the exact sensitivity score formula (`λ * ∇_x f(x + δ)`) is missing. The approach to handling non-convexity (local duality, convex relaxation) is mentioned but not elaborated upon sufficiently, leaving some ambiguity about its practical implementation and theoretical guarantees."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality by proposing a specific framework that integrates Lagrange duality into DNN interpretability via sensitivity analysis derived from a constrained optimization problem. While sensitivity analysis and duality are known concepts, their combination in this manner—particularly using the dual variable directly and solving via augmented backpropagation for feature importance certificates—appears novel in the context of deep learning explainability. It clearly distinguishes itself from existing gradient-based (IG) and perturbation-based (LIME) methods, offering a potentially more theoretically grounded alternative, aligning with the literature review's identification of gaps."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is conceptually grounded in the established theory of Lagrange duality. However, its soundness regarding the specific application to non-convex DNNs requires significant strengthening. Key weaknesses include: 1) Insufficient theoretical justification for interpreting the optimal dual variable \\\\lambda^* directly as a feature sensitivity measure or for the proposed sensitivity score formula. 2) The handling of non-convexity relies on claims of local duality (requiring strong assumptions and proof) and brief mentions of convex relaxation, lacking rigorous detail on how these overcome the fundamental challenges without compromising the method's integrity or 'certifiable' claims. 3) The convergence properties and theoretical guarantees of Algorithm 1 (saddle-point optimization for a non-convex primal) are not discussed. These gaps undermine the proposal's overall technical rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible from an implementation perspective. The core algorithmic idea involves modifying backpropagation, which is achievable using standard deep learning libraries. The proposed experiments use standard datasets, baselines, and metrics. Human evaluation via MTurk is also standard practice. The claim of improved efficiency compared to methods like SHAP/LIME is plausible but needs empirical verification. The primary feasibility risk lies in the theoretical challenges, particularly developing a provably correct and practically effective method to handle the non-convexity of DNNs within the proposed dual framework. Success hinges on overcoming these theoretical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses the highly significant problem of deep learning interpretability and the robustness of explanations, which are critical barriers to deploying AI in high-stakes applications. By aiming to provide mathematically grounded explanations with potential certificates of sensitivity, the research could lead to major advancements in trustworthy AI. The focus on integrating classical duality principles with modern non-convex optimization directly aligns with the workshop's theme and could stimulate new research directions. Success would yield impactful contributions to both theoretical understanding and practical applications of AI."
