        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's key problems of 'Reasoning and Planning' (enhancing FMs for multi-step reasoning) and 'Reliability and Responsibility' (addressing hallucination, improving reliability for critical applications). The focus on 'robust in-the-wild applications' and high-stakes domains like medicine fits perfectly with the workshop's theme of deploying FMs in society and ensuring their usefulness and reliability outside controlled environments. It also touches upon using retrieval augmentation, relevant to 'In-the-wild Adaptation'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation outlines the problem effectively (flawed reasoning chains). The main idea clearly describes the proposed solution: augmenting FMs with a dynamic verification module using retrieval-augmented verification for intermediate steps, coupled with an iterative correction feedback loop. The methodology components and expected outcomes (accuracy gains, reduced hallucination) are explicitly stated, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the core concept and goals."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While components like reasoning chains, verification, and retrieval augmentation exist, the proposed integration is novel. Specifically, the dynamic, step-wise verification of *intermediate* reasoning steps using external knowledge via retrieval, combined with an *iterative correction* feedback loop within the generation process, offers a fresh approach compared to post-hoc verification or standard RAG. It's an innovative combination aimed directly at improving multi-step reasoning reliability."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology. Foundation models, retrieval systems, and knowledge bases are available. However, implementation presents moderate challenges: designing effective verification queries, integrating the feedback loop efficiently, ensuring access to appropriate external knowledge sources for diverse tasks, and managing the potential increase in computational cost and latency due to verification at each step. Achieving the specific 15-20% accuracy gains requires empirical validation. It's implementable but requires significant engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical issue of FM reasoning reliability and hallucination, which is a major barrier to their trustworthy deployment in high-stakes, real-world applications (e.g., medicine, autonomous systems) explicitly mentioned in the motivation and relevant to the workshop's focus. Successfully improving reasoning robustness through dynamic verification could lead to major advancements in AI safety and enable broader, more reliable use of FMs in critical domains, representing a substantial contribution."
