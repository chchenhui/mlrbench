    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions addressing 'Reasoning and Planning', listing 'mathematical problem-solving' as a key example. The idea directly tackles this by proposing a method to enhance FM reasoning for complex math problems. It also touches upon 'Reliability' by aiming for verifiable solutions, another key theme of the workshop. The focus on improving FM capabilities for demanding STEM domains aligns perfectly with the 'in the wild' deployment theme."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (FM limitations in math), the core proposal (hybrid FM-symbolic solver approach), the method (decomposition, tool invocation, fine-tuning), and the expected outcome (improved accuracy, reliability, verifiable steps) are all clearly articulated and easy to understand. The use of specific examples like SymPy and WolframAlpha further enhances clarity. Minor details about the fine-tuning data format or specific integration architecture could be added, but the overall concept is exceptionally clear."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Combining language models with external tools, including symbolic solvers for math, is an active area of research (e.g., Toolformer, MathPrompter, integrations with WolframAlpha). The core concept of tool augmentation is not entirely new. However, the specific focus on generating verifiable, step-by-step reasoning chains that explicitly incorporate tool calls/outputs, and the proposed fine-tuning methodology on datasets annotated for this specific purpose, offers a degree of originality. It's more of a refinement and focused application of existing paradigms rather than a completely groundbreaking approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Foundation models are accessible, and symbolic solvers like SymPy are readily available (WolframAlpha via API). Fine-tuning is a standard, albeit resource-intensive, technique. Integrating tool calls into FM workflows has been demonstrated in prior work. The primary challenge lies in creating or obtaining the necessary fine-tuning dataset, which requires significant effort to annotate problems with detailed reasoning chains, tool calls, and outputs. While challenging, dataset creation is a common bottleneck in ML research and is considered feasible with adequate resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant importance and impact potential. Mathematical reasoning is a fundamental capability, and current FMs often struggle with precision and reliability in complex, multi-step problems. Improving this capability, especially by providing verifiable solutions, would greatly enhance the trustworthiness and utility of FMs in critical STEM fields like scientific research, engineering, and education. Addressing this known weakness could lead to meaningful advancements in how FMs are applied in domains requiring high accuracy."
