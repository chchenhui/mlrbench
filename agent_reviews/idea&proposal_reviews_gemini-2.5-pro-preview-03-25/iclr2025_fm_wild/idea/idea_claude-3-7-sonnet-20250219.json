        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (Workshop on FMs in the Wild). It directly addresses the workshop's key problem area of 'Reasoning and Planning' by proposing a method to enhance multi-step, multi-modal reasoning. It also fits squarely within the scope, particularly 'Advancements in the reasoning and planning abilities of FMs' and 'Methods for integrating multiple modalities'. The motivation explicitly links the problem to 'in-the-wild' deployments in critical domains like healthcare and science, matching the workshop's theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation, the core concept of a hierarchical memory (factual, reasoning trace, meta-cognitive), the role of the controller, and the intended evaluation domains are explained well. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of the meta-cognitive layer and the controller's interaction mechanism, but the overall research direction and architecture are understandable. It provides a solid foundation for further research."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While external memory augmentation for FMs is an active research area (e.g., RAG), the proposed specific hierarchical structure with three distinct layers (factual, reasoning trace, meta-cognitive) tailored for multi-modal reasoning offers a novel configuration. The inclusion of a meta-cognitive layer for evaluating reasoning quality and enabling backtracking adds a significant innovative element compared to standard memory approaches. The focus on explicitly managing multi-modal reasoning traces is also a relatively fresh perspective."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using existing ML techniques. Building hierarchical memory structures and using transformer-based controllers are achievable. Populating factual stores and designing evaluation tasks are standard practices. However, implementing the meta-cognitive layer effectively poses a significant research challenge â€“ reliably evaluating reasoning quality and detecting logical inconsistencies automatically is non-trivial. Integrating all components seamlessly and training the system will require considerable effort and computational resources, but it appears achievable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of FMs, especially across multiple modalities, is a critical bottleneck for their effective deployment in demanding real-world applications (healthcare, science, education). Successfully implementing this idea could lead to major advancements in how FMs assist in complex problem-solving, directly addressing a core challenge highlighted in the workshop call regarding the usefulness and impact of FMs 'in the wild'."
