    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on 'In-the-wild Adaptation' using techniques like RAG, ICL, and Fine-tuning for specific domains such as drug discovery, education, or clinical health. The idea directly addresses this key problem using the exact techniques and application areas mentioned in the workshop's call for papers. It fits perfectly within the scope of 'Innovations in techniques for customizing models to individual user preferences, tasks, or domains'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (FM adaptation challenges), the main approach (combining RAG, ICL, and FT), the steps involved (retrieval, contextual adaptation, fine-tuning), and the expected outcomes (improved adaptability, performance, reliability). The language is concise, and the proposed methodology is easy to understand without significant ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While using RAG, ICL, and fine-tuning for domain adaptation are known concepts individually, the proposed contribution seems to lie in the specific framework combining these techniques for *multi-domain* adaptation of FMs. However, the description doesn't detail specific innovations within the retrieval system or the integration strategy that would make it significantly different from existing approaches applying RAG for domain-specific tasks. It's more of a well-motivated application and integration of existing methods rather than introducing a fundamentally new concept."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. RAG, ICL, and fine-tuning are established techniques with available tools and frameworks. Accessing foundation models and domain-specific data corpora is achievable, although potentially resource-intensive depending on the scale and number of domains. The proposed steps are logical and implementable using current machine learning practices. Potential challenges might involve curating diverse domain corpora and computational costs for fine-tuning, but these are standard research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Improving the adaptability of FMs to diverse, specialized domains is a critical challenge for their real-world deployment ('FMs in the wild'), especially in high-stakes fields like medicine and finance mentioned in both the idea and the task description. Successfully enhancing adaptability and reliability would represent a meaningful contribution towards making FMs more practical and trustworthy, directly aligning with the workshop's goals."
