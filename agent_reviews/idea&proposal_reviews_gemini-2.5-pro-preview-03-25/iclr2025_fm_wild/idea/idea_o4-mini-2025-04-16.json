    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on Foundation Models (FMs) 'in the wild', emphasizing reliability, responsibility, adaptation (specifically mentioning RAG and clinical health), and reasoning. SafeRAG directly tackles FM reliability and safety (addressing hallucination) in the critical domain of clinical health, using RAG for adaptation and incorporating elements of reasoning (evidence citation, multi-hop retrieval). It fits squarely within the workshop's key problems and scope, particularly 'Reliability and Responsibility' and 'In-the-wild Adaptation'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (RAG, uncertainty estimation, adaptive retrieval, human fallback), and expected outcomes are clearly presented. The pipeline steps are logical and understandable. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise method for 'learning' the uncertainty threshold or the specifics of the multi-hop retrieval strategy, but the overall concept is well-defined and comprehensible."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates satisfactory novelty. While the core components (RAG, uncertainty estimation like MC dropout, CoT prompting, human-in-the-loop) are existing techniques, their specific integration into a pipeline guided by uncertainty for adaptive retrieval and fallback in the clinical domain offers a degree of originality. The novelty lies more in the specific application, combination, and the adaptive mechanism (expanding retrieval/prompting based on uncertainty) rather than in fundamentally new algorithms. It builds upon existing work in a meaningful way for a specific application."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Implementing RAG with existing medical knowledge bases (UMLS, PubMed) is achievable. Uncertainty estimation techniques like MC dropout are standard. The main challenges lie in curating/maintaining the knowledge base, potentially requiring significant domain expertise, carefully designing and validating the uncertainty threshold mechanism (requiring appropriate datasets and metrics), and implementing the human-in-the-loop system efficiently. While requiring substantial engineering and potentially clinical collaboration, it is implementable with current technology."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the reliability and safety of FMs in clinical decision support is a critical challenge. Hallucinations or incorrect diagnoses generated by AI can have severe consequences for patient safety. By aiming to provide calibrated confidence, reduce errors through evidence grounding, and incorporate safety fallbacks, SafeRAG targets a crucial bottleneck for the responsible adoption of FMs in healthcare, potentially leading to major advancements in trustworthy clinical AI."
