        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly highlights the challenge of training on self-generated data without collapse due to unreliable learned verifiers or reward models. It calls for algorithms that 'adapt to errors made by the learned evaluation model'. This research idea directly addresses this by proposing a mechanism (confidence-aware filtering) to mitigate the impact of verifier errors and prevent collapse, fitting squarely within the core problems and goals outlined for the workshop, particularly 'Training on machine-generated synthetic data without collapse' and adapting to verifier failures."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (verifier unreliability, collapse risk) is explicitly stated. The core mechanism (verifier estimates quality and confidence, filtering based on confidence) is explained concisely. Potential methods for confidence estimation and actions for low-confidence samples are suggested, leaving little ambiguity about the proposed approach and its objective."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While uncertainty quantification techniques (ensembles, Bayesian methods) are established in ML, their specific application to filter self-generated data based on *verifier confidence* within a self-improvement loop to explicitly combat *model collapse* is a novel approach. Standard methods often filter based only on the predicted quality score, without considering the verifier's certainty. This targeted use of confidence addresses a key failure mode in self-improvement in a distinct way."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Methods for uncertainty quantification like deep ensembles or MC dropout are well-established and implementable with current deep learning frameworks. Integrating a confidence score into the data selection process is technically straightforward. The main challenges are the potential computational overhead associated with uncertainty estimation (e.g., training/running multiple models for ensembles) and the need for careful tuning of the confidence threshold or weighting scheme, but these do not represent fundamental roadblocks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Model collapse due to unreliable feedback is a critical barrier to successful, large-scale self-improvement, as emphasized in the task description. By proposing a method to make the self-improvement process more robust to verifier errors, this research could lead to more stable and effective training regimes, enabling models to genuinely improve beyond their initial data without degenerating. This directly addresses a core challenge for scaling foundation models and has potential positive implications for safety and reliability."
