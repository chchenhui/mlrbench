    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The 'SafeTrack' idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research into 'Training on machine-generated synthetic data without collapse' and addressing the 'verification-generation gap' where models exploit unreliable verifiers, leading to collapse. SafeTrack directly proposes a framework to prevent this collapse by using multiple verification layers, anomaly detection for exploitation, and safety mechanisms like checkpointing and recalibration. It aligns perfectly with the goal of enabling self-improvement without human supervision while considering safety and reliability, which are central themes in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is clearly articulated. The motivation explains the problem of collapse in SIFMs well. The main idea outlines a multi-component framework (ensemble verifiers, reference dataset, anomaly detection, automated responses) with a clear goal. The description is concise and understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific algorithms for ensemble rotation or anomaly detection, but the overall concept and architecture are well-defined for a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like ensemble methods, using reference data, and anomaly detection are established techniques, their integration into a dynamic, multi-layered verification framework specifically designed to detect and prevent collapse by monitoring the verification-generation gap in SIFMs is innovative. The proposed mechanism of rotating verifiers based on disagreement patterns and automatically triggering recalibration or halting based on statistical signals of exploitation represents a novel synthesis applied to this specific problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Implementing ensemble models, maintaining reference datasets, applying statistical anomaly detection, and controlling training parameters (learning rate, checkpointing) are all achievable with current ML technology and practices. However, integrating these components into a robust, automated system ('SafeTrack') presents significant engineering challenges. Tuning the various thresholds, managing the computational overhead of multiple verifiers, and ensuring genuine diversity in the verifier ensemble will require considerable effort and experimentation. It's complex but not fundamentally impractical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Preventing model collapse is a critical bottleneck for realizing the potential of self-improving foundation models, which is presented in the task description as essential for overcoming data limitations. A successful framework like SafeTrack would enable safer, more reliable autonomous AI enhancement, potentially accelerating progress in AI capabilities while mitigating risks associated with uncontrolled self-improvement. It addresses a core challenge with potentially transformative impact on the field."
