    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The workshop focuses on generalization, transfer, and learning in sequential decision-making (SDM), bridging RL and AI planning. The idea explicitly proposes using meta-learning, a topic listed in the call ('Meta-learning for generalizable policies', 'Few-shot learning and transfer for SDM'), to tackle core challenges mentioned in the workshop description, such as sample efficiency, generalizability, and transferability in SDM. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated. It outlines the motivation (limitations of current methods), the main concept (meta-learner + task-specific learner), the methodology (meta-training, meta-testing, fine-tuning), and expected outcomes (improved generalization, sample efficiency, transferability). The core proposal is well-defined and understandable. However, it lacks specific details on the types of meta-learning algorithms, the nature of the SDM tasks, or the model architectures, which prevents a perfect score but is acceptable for a research idea summary."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea applies meta-learning, an established technique, to the problem of generalized SDM. While meta-learning for RL (meta-RL) exists, the novelty might lie in tailoring it specifically for 'generalized' SDM (potentially encompassing broader structural variations than typical meta-RL benchmarks) and explicitly targeting challenges like long-horizon planning within this framework. It combines existing concepts in a relevant way for the workshop's theme, but it doesn't propose a fundamentally new learning paradigm. The description is general, so the degree of true innovation depends on the specific implementation details not provided."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed research is largely feasible using current ML techniques and computational resources. Meta-learning frameworks and RL algorithms are well-documented. However, meta-RL research often faces practical challenges: high sample complexity during meta-training, potential instability, and the difficulty of designing a diverse yet representative set of meta-training tasks that promotes true generalization. Implementing and effectively training such a system, especially for complex or long-horizon SDM tasks, requires significant expertise and computational resources, making it non-trivial but achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses highly significant and recognized open problems in AI: improving generalization, sample efficiency, and transfer learning in sequential decision-making. These are central challenges highlighted in the workshop description. Success in this area could lead to more adaptable and capable AI systems applicable to various domains like robotics, planning, and control. Developing methods that allow agents to learn quickly from few examples and generalize to unseen problems would be a major contribution to the field."
