    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop on Generalization in Planning), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes, including generalization in SDM, bridging RL and symbolic planning, hierarchical policies, neuro-symbolic methods, meta-learning, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, particularly in robotics contexts. The proposal faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the neuro-symbolic architecture, meta-learned sub-policies, bi-level optimization, contrastive learning, and LLM refinement. It effectively situates itself within the recent literature (NeSyC, VisualPredicator, etc.), acknowledging prior work and explicitly aiming to tackle the identified key challenges (alignment, generalization, verification, sample efficiency). The objectives and methodology directly reflect the requirements and concepts outlined in the source materials."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, following a logical progression from introduction to methodology and expected outcomes. The objectives are clearly stated, and the overall architecture is described conceptually. The use of established concepts like MAML and PPO is clear. However, some technical details could be more precise. The exact mechanism of the bi-level optimization, particularly how schemas and policies are jointly updated, could be elaborated further. The LLM-guided repair mechanism, especially the formulation of the `L_repair` loss function involving BERT embeddings, lacks sufficient detail and justification, making it somewhat ambiguous how the LLM's output is integrated and used for refinement. The missing figure (referenced as `not_a_url`) slightly hinders visualization of the architecture."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While neuro-symbolic approaches and meta-learning for RL exist, the specific combination proposed here is novel. Key innovative aspects include: (1) The explicit formulation of aligning symbolic schemas and meta-learned sub-policies as a *bi-level optimization* problem aimed at cross-domain transfer. (2) The application of *contrastive meta-learning* to disentangle task-invariant and task-specific components within this hierarchical neuro-symbolic framework. (3) The integration of *LLM-guided repair* specifically for verifying and refining the execution of meta-learned sub-policies within the symbolic plan structure. This synthesis of hierarchical planning, meta-RL, contrastive learning, and LLM refinement for robust cross-domain generalization distinguishes it from the cited literature (NeSyC, Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer, VisualPredicator, NeSIG)."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, built upon established foundations like PDDL/HTN planning, meta-RL (MAML, PPO), and contrastive learning. The overall neuro-symbolic architecture is conceptually reasonable. However, there are weaknesses in rigor. The bi-level optimization approach, while theoretically appealing, is complex, and its practical convergence and effectiveness in truly aligning symbolic schemas with meta-learned policies are strong assumptions needing more justification. The LLM-guided repair mechanism, particularly the `L_repair` loss function, seems ad-hoc and lacks clear theoretical grounding or detailed explanation of the interaction mechanism (how `z_t^LLM` is generated and why it's compared to BERT embeddings this way). The mention of SMT solvers in the introduction isn't followed through in the methodology, which focuses on the less formal LLM approach for verification/refinement. The assumption that PDDL-like schemas can be effectively optimized to match neural policy capabilities via the proposed KL divergence loss needs stronger backing."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating symbolic planning, meta-RL (known to be sample-hungry and hard to tune), contrastive learning, LLM interaction, and bi-level optimization into a single cohesive system is technically very demanding. Bi-level optimization is computationally expensive and notoriously difficult to implement correctly. Reliable LLM integration for plan repair requires sophisticated prompt engineering and grounding. Training requires substantial computational resources (GPU clusters) and diverse, large-scale simulation environments (like ProcTHOR). The project demands expertise across multiple AI subfields (planning, RL, meta-learning, NLP/LLMs). While the components exist individually, their successful integration and optimization within a reasonable timeframe carry substantial risks, making the overall feasibility borderline without significant resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and challenging problem in AI: achieving robust generalization and transfer in sequential decision-making, particularly for complex, long-horizon tasks relevant to robotics and autonomous systems. Bridging the gap between data-driven RL and symbolic planning is a critical research frontier. If successful, the proposed framework could lead to major advancements in creating AI agents that can adapt to novel situations with minimal retraining, enabling more practical real-world deployments (e.g., adaptable household robots, logistics systems). The potential impact on both the AI research community (unifying RL and planning) and practical applications is substantial. The focus on zero-shot/few-shot generalization directly tackles a key limitation of current methods."
