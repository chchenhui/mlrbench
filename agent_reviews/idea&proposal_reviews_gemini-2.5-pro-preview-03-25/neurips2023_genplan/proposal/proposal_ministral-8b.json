        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on generalization in planning, neuro-symbolic approaches, hierarchical policies, meta-learning, and bridging symbolic planning with RL. The proposal faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the proposed framework and its components. It also explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the provided literature review, such as sample efficiency, alignment of symbolic/neural components, and cross-domain generalization. The objectives and methodology are directly derived from and consistent with the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, background, significance, and overall methodology are presented logically and are easy to understand. The breakdown of the framework into components (Symbolic Planner, Meta-Learned Sub-Policies, Bi-Level Optimization, Contrastive Meta-Learning, Neuro-Symbolic Plan Repair) and the description of algorithmic steps provide good structure. However, some technical details, particularly regarding the precise formulation of the bi-level optimization and the mechanism for LLM-guided refinement (especially the 'gradient-based approach' integration), could be more specific. Despite these minor points needing potential refinement, the core ideas and research plan are communicated effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced techniques (symbolic planning, meta-RL, bi-level optimization, contrastive learning, LLM-based repair) into a single hierarchical neuro-symbolic framework specifically targeting cross-domain generalization. While individual components draw inspiration from existing work (as evidenced by the literature review, e.g., neuro-symbolic hierarchy, contrastive learning in NeSyC), the specific combination and the proposed mechanisms for alignment (bi-level optimization) and disentanglement (contrastive meta-learning) within this context offer a fresh perspective. The use of LLMs for plan repair in this specific neuro-symbolic loop also adds a novel element. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it builds on established trends, but the synthesis of these elements is innovative."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established concepts in symbolic planning (PDDL), reinforcement learning (meta-RL), optimization (bi-level), and machine learning (contrastive learning, LLMs). The motivation to combine the strengths of symbolic and sub-symbolic methods is well-founded. The proposed methodology follows a logical research design. However, the technical soundness has minor gaps: the specifics of the bi-level optimization formulation are not provided, making it hard to assess its rigor fully; the integration of LLM feedback via a 'gradient-based approach' is conceptually vague and needs more technical justification regarding how symbolic/textual LLM output translates to gradients for plan/policy updates. While the overall approach is plausible, these specific aspects require further technical elaboration to ensure full rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating a symbolic planner, meta-RL for sub-policies, bi-level optimization for alignment, contrastive learning, and LLM-based plan repair into a cohesive system is highly complex. Each component requires substantial expertise and development effort. Bi-level optimization is known to be difficult to implement and tune effectively. Meta-RL requires significant computational resources and diverse training data (though ProcTHOR helps). Reliably integrating LLM feedback into the planning loop presents technical hurdles. The overall complexity introduces considerable risk regarding successful implementation within a typical research project timeframe and resource constraints."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in AI: achieving robust generalization and sample efficiency in sequential decision-making, particularly for long-horizon tasks in complex domains like robotics. Bridging the gap between symbolic planning and reinforcement learning is a critical research frontier. If successful, the proposed framework could lead to major advancements in creating more adaptable, reliable, and deployable AI systems capable of transferring skills across domains with minimal data. The potential impact on robotics, autonomous systems, and the unification of AI planning and RL communities is substantial."
