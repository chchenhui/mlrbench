        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on generalization in planning, neuro-symbolic approaches, hierarchical policies, meta-learning, and transfer learning. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core concepts outlined in the research idea (neuro-symbolic hierarchy, meta-learned policies, bi-level optimization, contrastive learning, LLM repair). Furthermore, it positions itself effectively within the recent literature, citing relevant works (Hierarchical Decision Transformer, VisualPredicator) and explicitly aiming to tackle key challenges identified (alignment, generalization, verification, sample efficiency)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly written. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically. Key technical concepts like the neuro-symbolic architecture, bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, and LLM-guided repair are explained conceptually. The experimental design is detailed with specific benchmarks, baselines, and metrics. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism linking symbolic schemas to neural policies and the practical implementation details of the bi-level optimization and LLM repair, but these are acceptable for a proposal stage. Overall, the proposal is mostly clear and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by synthesizing several advanced techniques (symbolic planning, meta-RL, bi-level optimization, contrastive learning, formal verification, LLM repair) into a unified framework for cross-domain generalization. While individual components exist in the literature (as shown in the review), their specific combination and application – particularly the bi-level optimization for symbolic-neural alignment, contrastive meta-learning for disentangling skills in this context, and the integration of LLM-based repair guided by formal verification – represents a novel approach. It clearly distinguishes itself from the cited recent works by integrating these elements uniquely."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is built upon sound theoretical foundations from symbolic planning (PDDL), reinforcement learning (meta-RL, MAML), representation learning (contrastive methods), optimization (bi-level), and formal methods (LTL). The proposed architecture and methodologies are conceptually coherent. The mathematical formulations, while high-level, appear appropriate. However, the soundness relies on the successful integration and interaction of these complex components. Potential challenges, acknowledged implicitly by the literature review, include the convergence and stability of the bi-level optimization, the effectiveness of contrastive learning for the desired disentanglement, and the reliability of LLM-based plan repair. While generally sound, these aspects introduce moderate risks regarding the robustness of the proposed method."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is ambitious and presents significant implementation challenges. While the individual components (symbolic planners, meta-RL algorithms, contrastive learning frameworks, LTL checkers, LLMs) exist, integrating them into a cohesive and functional system requires substantial engineering effort and expertise across multiple domains. Key challenges include implementing and tuning the bi-level optimization, generating diverse-enough environments for effective meta-learning, ensuring robust performance of the contrastive learning objective, and developing a reliable LLM repair mechanism (potentially requiring significant fine-tuning or prompt engineering). Significant computational resources will be needed. While feasible for a well-resourced team, the complexity introduces considerable risk regarding successful implementation within a typical project timeframe."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and challenging problem in AI: achieving robust generalization and transfer in sequential decision-making, particularly for complex, long-horizon tasks relevant to robotics and autonomous systems. Bridging symbolic reasoning and adaptive learning is a key research frontier. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially leading to more sample-efficient, adaptable, and reliable AI agents capable of operating effectively across different domains with formal safety considerations. The potential impact on robotics, autonomous systems, and the broader understanding of neuro-symbolic AI is substantial."
