        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of synergizing reasoning (LLM Chain-of-Thought) and decision-making (Reinforcement Learning control) for open-world agents. It tackles key challenges mentioned, such as planning in unseen scenarios (procedurally generated environments), interleaving reasoning and decision-making, and potentially reducing supervision via self-supervised fine-tuning. The proposed RL-CoT framework is a direct attempt to answer the workshop's central questions about unifying these capabilities for open-world environments."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core components (LLM, hierarchical RL, feedback loop, dynamic buffer), interaction mechanism, and expected outcomes are explained. The concept of interleaving LLM-generated CoT with RL execution and using feedback for refinement is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the self-supervised fine-tuning mechanism, the exact structure of the hierarchical policy, and how the 'rationale' from CoT precisely conditions the RL policy, but the overall research direction is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea has notable originality. While combining LLMs and RL for planning and control is an active research area, the proposed RL-CoT framework introduces specific novel elements. Key innovations include the dynamic generation and iterative refinement of Chain-of-Thought based *directly* on RL interaction feedback through a self-supervised loop, and the use of a dynamic replay buffer prioritizing reasoning quality. This contrasts with approaches using static plans or less adaptive feedback mechanisms. It offers a fresh perspective on tightly integrating reasoning and grounded interaction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating large LLMs with complex hierarchical RL systems is computationally intensive and requires substantial engineering effort. Training stability could be an issue, particularly the self-supervised fine-tuning of the LLM based on potentially sparse or noisy RL feedback. Designing the appropriate feedback signals and ensuring the LLM effectively refines its reasoning based on low-level interaction outcomes is non-trivial. Success likely requires significant computational resources and expertise in both LLMs and RL."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of building agents capable of both high-level reasoning and adaptive decision-making in complex, dynamic open-world environments â€“ a central goal in AI research. If successful, RL-CoT could lead to major advancements in agent generalization, sample efficiency, adaptability, and interpretability, impacting fields like robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems. It directly contributes to the scientific questions posed by the workshop."
