        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of synergizing reasoning and decision-making for open-world agents. The proposal explicitly mentions 'interleaved reasoning and decision-making', 'open-world agents', 'continual learning', 'generalization to novel scenarios', and the need for minimal supervision, all of which are key topics highlighted in the workshop description and its example questions. The motivation and main idea directly tackle the challenge of unifying these two cognitive functions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation is compelling, and the main idea introduces the IRDN architecture with its three core components (reasoning, decision, knowledge bank) and the key 'cognitive cycle' mechanism. The goal of generalization through abstracted reasoning patterns and the proposed evaluation method are also clearly stated. While implementation details are naturally high-level in a research idea summary, the core concept is articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While combining reasoning and decision-making is an active research area (e.g., model-based RL, LLM agents), the proposed IRDN architecture with an explicit mediating knowledge bank and a specific 'cognitive cycle' mechanism for tight, bidirectional coupling offers a fresh perspective. The emphasis on continually learning *abstracted reasoning patterns* within this cycle to facilitate generalization to unseen tasks adds a distinct innovative element compared to simpler sequential chaining or tool-use approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The individual components (reasoning module like an LLM, decision module like an RL agent, knowledge bank) are based on existing technologies. However, effectively implementing the 'cognitive cycle' – ensuring meaningful bidirectional information flow where reasoning outputs concretely shape the action space and action outcomes effectively update the knowledge representation for better future reasoning – is complex. Training stability, efficient knowledge representation updates, and designing appropriate environments/benchmarks for evaluation pose considerable hurdles. It requires substantial research and engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It targets a fundamental limitation in current AI systems – the separation of reasoning and decision-making – which is a major bottleneck for developing truly adaptive open-world agents. Successfully developing IRDNs could lead to major advancements in AI capabilities, enabling agents to handle novel, dynamic situations more effectively. This has broad implications for fields like robotics, autonomous systems, game AI, and advanced LLM applications, directly addressing the core scientific questions posed by the workshop."
