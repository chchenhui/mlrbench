    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'synergizing reasoning and decision-making' for 'open-world agents'. The proposal explicitly aims to unify high-level reasoning (LLM) with low-level decision-making (RL agent) to handle dynamic environments and unseen scenarios, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus. It touches upon several specific interests mentioned, such as interleaved reasoning/decision-making, LLMs, RL in open worlds, planning in unseen scenarios, and continuous learning through adaptive replanning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated and well-defined. The motivation is understandable, and the proposed architecture involving an LLM for high-level adaptive planning and a lower-level module for execution is described logically. The concept of a feedback loop triggering LLM re-reasoning and replanning is central and clearly explained. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise format of the plans/primitives or the exact mechanism for translating environment feedback into LLM prompts for replanning, but the overall concept is readily comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using LLMs for planning and hierarchical architectures are existing concepts, the proposed mechanism for tight, closed-loop integration where environmental feedback dynamically triggers symbolic re-reasoning and replanning by the LLM mid-execution offers a novel approach to synergizing reasoning and action. It moves beyond static LLM-generated plans or purely reactive systems by emphasizing continuous adaptation guided by high-level reasoning informed by real-time execution outcomes. The novelty lies more in the specific synergistic integration and adaptive feedback loop than in the individual components."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. LLMs can generate structured outputs like plans, and RL agents can execute policies or primitives. Integrating these components and establishing a robust feedback loop is achievable. However, potential challenges include the latency of LLM inference for real-time replanning, ensuring the LLM correctly interprets diverse environmental feedback, grounding the symbolic plans in the execution context, and the computational cost. Significant engineering effort would be required, but the core concepts are implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Addressing the challenge of creating agents that can robustly reason and make decisions in dynamic, open-world environments is a critical goal in AI. Successfully unifying symbolic reasoning with situated decision-making through an adaptive planning loop could lead to major advancements in agent autonomy, generalization, and adaptability across various domains like robotics, game AI, and complex task automation. It directly tackles a fundamental limitation of current AI systems."
