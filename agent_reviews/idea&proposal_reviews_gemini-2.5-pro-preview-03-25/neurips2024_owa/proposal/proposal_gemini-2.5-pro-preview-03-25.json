        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of synergizing reasoning and decision-making for open-world agents. The problem statement accurately reflects the challenges highlighted in the literature review and the research idea. The objectives and methodology are a direct translation and elaboration of the research idea, incorporating concepts and challenges discussed in the provided literature (e.g., LLM+RL integration, knowledge management, generalization, minimal supervision). The significance section explicitly connects the research to the key questions posed in the workshop task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a clear background and problem statement, followed by specific objectives, a detailed methodology, and expected outcomes. Key components like the LLM Reasoner, RL Agent, and Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR) are clearly defined, and their interactions are explained through a step-by-step workflow. Technical details, such as the choice of RL algorithms (PPO/SAC), the contrastive loss function (InfoNCE), and evaluation metrics, are specified precisely. The language is articulate and unambiguous, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the core concept of integrating LLMs and RL for agent control is an active area of research (as evidenced by the literature review), the proposal's specific contribution lies in the proposed DKDRL architecture. The emphasis on the Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR) as a central, continuously updated, hybrid (vector + structured) memory mediating between the LLM and RL components is a distinct architectural choice. Furthermore, the explicit use of contrastive learning to align LLM subgoal embeddings with RL state representations is a specific and novel integration technique within this context. It builds upon existing work but proposes a unique configuration and mechanism for synergy, distinguishing it from the cited papers which focus on aspects like RL training efficiency ([1]), online grounding ([2]), exploration ([3]), or web agents ([4])."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established principles of LLMs, RL (PPO/SAC), and knowledge representation. The motivation for the hybrid architecture and the DKR is logically derived from the limitations of existing approaches outlined in the introduction and literature review. The proposed methodology, including the workflow, component functions, reward structure, and the contrastive alignment mechanism (with correctly stated InfoNCE loss), is technically coherent. The reliance on standard algorithms and techniques adds to its soundness. Minor gaps exist in the specific implementation details of the DKR (e.g., exact schema, update algorithms), but this is acceptable at the proposal stage. The overall approach is theoretically solid and methodologically well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating a large LLM, a complex RL agent (trained in demanding simulators like Minecraft or robotics environments), and a sophisticated Dynamic Knowledge Repository is technically ambitious. It requires substantial computational resources (GPU clusters for training), access to powerful LLMs, and significant engineering effort for integration, debugging, and tuning. The proposed evaluation across multiple environments and task types is comprehensive but resource-intensive. While the core technologies exist, successfully realizing the full DKDRL system as described, particularly the seamless functioning of the DKR and the effectiveness of the alignment, involves considerable research risk and engineering complexity. It's feasible within a well-funded, expert research group but is far from straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical challenge in AI: creating agents that can operate autonomously and adaptively in complex, open-world environments by unifying reasoning and decision-making. This directly aligns with the workshop's focus and tackles fundamental questions about knowledge acquisition, generalization, and reduced supervision in AI. Success would represent a major advancement over specialized agents, with substantial potential applications in robotics, game AI, autonomous systems, and personalized assistants, as clearly articulated. The research could provide valuable insights into building more general AI and potentially influence future directions in integrating symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches."
