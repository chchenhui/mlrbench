    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses 'Adaptive Experimental Design and Active Learning in the Real World', specifically targeting 'drug design', which is listed as a key example application. The idea incorporates 'active learning', 'Bayesian optimization', 'contextual bandits', 'domain-knowledge integration (chemistry, biology)', and 'scalability', all of which are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied in the workshop's topics of interest. It focuses on making experimental design practically relevant for a high-impact application, matching the workshop's goal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (cost/time of drug discovery) is compelling, and the main idea (adaptive experimental design framework using active learning and domain knowledge) is articulated concisely. The methodology is broken down into four understandable steps (Domain Knowledge Integration, Bayesian Optimization, Active Learning, Scalability). Expected outcomes and potential impact are clearly stated. While the exact mechanisms for domain knowledge integration or achieving scalability aren't fully detailed, the overall concept and approach are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While using Bayesian optimization and active learning for optimizing experiments, including in drug/materials discovery, is an active area of research, the proposed integration of specific domain knowledge (chemical, biological properties) within an adaptive framework potentially using contextual bandits, and explicitly addressing scalability, offers a degree of innovation. It's more of a novel application and integration of existing advanced techniques tailored to a specific complex problem rather than proposing a fundamentally new algorithm or theoretical concept. The novelty lies in the specific combination, implementation, and focus on practical drug discovery challenges."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core techniques (Bayesian optimization, active learning, contextual bandits) are established ML methods. Integrating domain knowledge is achievable, although potentially complex. The main challenges would be accessing sufficient high-quality experimental data (a common issue in drug discovery research), effectively encoding complex domain knowledge, and demonstrating scalability in a real-world setting. Computational resources are needed but are generally available for such research. While real-world experimental validation is costly and time-consuming, simulations and work on existing datasets are viable starting points. The feasibility is good, but practical hurdles exist."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Drug discovery is a critical area with immense societal value, hampered by high costs and long timelines. Successfully developing a framework that makes this process significantly more efficient by reducing the number of required experiments could lead to major advancements: faster development of life-saving drugs, reduced R&D costs, and improved patient outcomes. The problem addressed is substantial, and the potential benefits are transformative for the field. The potential extension to other areas like materials design further enhances its significance."
