        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on real-world experimental design and active learning, explicitly mentioning materials design, Bayesian optimization, efficient active learning, and domain-knowledge integration (specifically physics) as topics of interest. The proposed 'Physics-Constrained Active Learning for Accelerated Materials Discovery' directly addresses these points by applying Bayesian Optimization to materials design while integrating physics knowledge to improve efficiency and practical relevance, tackling the challenge of making active learning practically relevant for scientific discovery."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly outlines the problem (inefficiency of standard BO in exploring physically implausible material candidates). The main idea (PC-BO) is stated concisely, and the proposed mechanisms (physics-informed surrogates, modified acquisition functions) are specific and understandable. The expected outcome (accelerated discovery of valid materials) is also clearly articulated. There is minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While Bayesian Optimization for materials discovery and physics-informed machine learning are existing areas, the proposed framework specifically focuses on integrating physical constraints directly into the BO loop (via constrained surrogates or acquisition functions) to actively prune the search space towards physically plausible candidates. This specific combination and application focus offers a fresh perspective on improving active learning efficiency in scientific discovery, moving beyond standard BO approaches. It's a novel synthesis and application of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking technique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Bayesian Optimization libraries are readily available. Techniques for constructing constrained Gaussian Processes exist, although their complexity depends on the nature of the constraints. Modifying acquisition functions is a standard technique in BO research. The main challenge lies in accurately formulating and encoding potentially complex physical laws as constraints for the specific material system, which requires significant domain expertise and might pose implementation hurdles depending on the complexity. However, the core ML concepts are well-established, making the overall approach practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Materials discovery is crucial for technological advancement across various sectors. The high cost and time associated with experiments/simulations represent a major bottleneck. By proposing a method to make the active learning search significantly more efficient by focusing only on physically realistic candidates, this research directly addresses a critical practical problem. Success could lead to substantial acceleration in discovering novel materials with desired properties, offering major benefits to materials science and related industries."
