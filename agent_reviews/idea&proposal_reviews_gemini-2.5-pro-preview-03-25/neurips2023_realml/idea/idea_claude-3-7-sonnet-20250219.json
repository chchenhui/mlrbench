        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on real-world experimental design and active learning, mentioning protein design as a key application area. The proposed 'NeuroGuided Protein Design' directly addresses this by applying active learning, Bayesian optimization, and neural networks (all mentioned topics) to the problem of efficient protein engineering, aiming to bridge the gap between ML algorithms and practical experimental workflows."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (inefficiency in protein engineering), the proposed solution (an active learning framework combining deep learning and Bayesian optimization), the core mechanism (iterative learning, exploration/exploitation via uncertainty), and a key innovation (hierarchical protein representation). The expected impact (60-80% reduction in experiments) is also stated. While specifics of the hierarchical representation could be slightly more detailed, the overall concept is immediately understandable and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While active learning and Bayesian optimization have been applied to molecular design, the specific combination proposed, particularly the emphasis on a neural network ensemble for uncertainty and the 'hierarchical representation capturing both local structural motifs and global folding patterns' for better generalization in protein space, offers a fresh perspective. It's not a completely new paradigm but represents a thoughtful integration and potential advancement of existing techniques tailored specifically for protein engineering challenges."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It leverages established techniques like deep learning (ensembles), Bayesian optimization, and active learning loops. The required components (computational resources, initial data, experimental validation cycle) are standard in the field, although integrating ML models smoothly with wet-lab experiments always presents practical challenges. The development of the specific 'hierarchical representation' is crucial but seems achievable using modern ML approaches for structured data. The claimed efficiency gain is ambitious but plausible as a research goal."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Protein engineering is critical for advancements in medicine, biotechnology, and materials science. The vastness of the protein sequence space is a major bottleneck. An approach that could genuinely reduce experimental effort by 60-80% would represent a major breakthrough, dramatically accelerating the discovery and development of novel proteins with desired functions. It addresses a critical real-world problem with high potential impact, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
