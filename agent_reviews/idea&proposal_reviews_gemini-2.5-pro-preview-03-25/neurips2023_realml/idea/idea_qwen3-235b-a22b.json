        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses 'real-world experimental design' in 'drug design' and 'materials design', focuses on 'efficient active learning and exploration' in 'data-scarce' settings, proposes using 'neural networks' (GNNs) for 'exploration in high-dimensional spaces', explicitly tackles 'domain-knowledge integration', mentions 'multi-objective experimentation', and aims for 'scalable Bayesian optimization'. It hits nearly all the key technical topics mentioned in the call for papers."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation, problem statement, proposed methodology (GNN-VAE on heterogeneous graphs encoding domain knowledge, coupled with deep BO), and evaluation plan are articulated concisely and logically. The specific components and their interactions are explained well. Minor ambiguities might exist in the precise mechanisms for encoding *all* types of domain knowledge into the graph structure or the exact formulation of the dynamic multi-objective weighting, but the overall concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While GNNs, VAEs, and BO are existing techniques, their specific combination and application here are innovative. The core novelty lies in using a GNN-VAE on a heterogeneous graph specifically constructed to encode structured domain knowledge (rules, validated subgraphs) to guide a deep Bayesian Optimization process. Furthermore, tailoring the acquisition function to explicitly balance uncertainty-based exploration with domain-knowledge-anchored exploitation, and extending this to dynamically weighted multi-objective scenarios based on prior knowledge, represents a fresh approach compared to standard BO or active learning methods that struggle to incorporate such rich, qualitative information."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core components (GNNs, VAEs, Deep BO) are established, and molecular graph representations are standard. However, systematically encoding diverse domain knowledge (especially qualitative rules) into graph structures (auxiliary edges/features) might require significant effort and careful design. Training the combined GNN-VAE and deep BO pipeline could be computationally intensive, requiring substantial resources and expertise in multiple ML subfields. Scalability, while mentioned as a goal, needs careful implementation. Accessing curated domain knowledge might also require significant effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical bottleneck of expensive and scarce experimental data in high-impact domains like drug discovery and materials science. Effectively integrating domain knowledge, which is often underutilized by purely data-driven methods, could lead to major advancements by significantly accelerating the discovery process. A 2-3x reduction in required experiments, if achieved, would represent a substantial practical benefit, saving time and resources. The methodology could potentially generalize to other scientific discovery tasks involving structured data and expert knowledge."
