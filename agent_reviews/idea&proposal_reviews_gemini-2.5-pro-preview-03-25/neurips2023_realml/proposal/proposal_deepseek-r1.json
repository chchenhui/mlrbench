    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on real-world active learning, specifically in materials design, by proposing a method to integrate domain knowledge (physics constraints). It accurately reflects the core research idea of PC-BO. Furthermore, it explicitly references recent work (Smith et al., Garcia et al.) mentioned in the literature review and aims to tackle key challenges identified therein, such as balancing exploration/exploitation under constraints and scalability. It comprehensively covers the requirements and context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and logically follow from the introduction. The methodology section clearly outlines the proposed techniques (constrained GP, composite kernel, penalized acquisition function) with relevant mathematical context and a step-by-step algorithmic workflow. The experimental design is detailed, including datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The structure is logical, making it easy to understand the proposed research from motivation to expected impact."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The literature review indicates that physics-constrained BO/ML for materials discovery is a very active research area with numerous relevant publications in 2023, including the cited Smith et al. and Garcia et al. papers. The core idea of using constrained GPs or acquisition functions is therefore not fundamentally new. The novelty lies primarily in the specific implementation: the proposed composite kernel structure, the particular penalized EI formulation, the integration of constraints at both surrogate and acquisition levels, the handling of unknown/noisy constraints via classifiers, and the strong focus on systematic validation, generalization, and scalability. It represents a solid incremental advancement and integration of recent ideas rather than a groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is methodologically sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations of Bayesian Optimization and Gaussian Processes. The proposed methods for incorporating constraints (composite kernel, penalized acquisition function) are recognized techniques in the field. The inclusion of probabilistic classifiers for unknown constraints is a sensible extension. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate baselines, metrics, synthetic/real-world validation, and ablation studies, demonstrating rigor. While details on tuning hyperparameters (like lambda) or the specifics of scalability solutions are brief, the overall approach is technically well-founded and grounded in the relevant literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core methods (GPs, BO) rely on existing ML techniques and libraries (e.g., GPyTorch mentioned). Generating synthetic data is straightforward. While real-world validation requires collaboration and access to experimental data/simulations, this is standard practice. The main challenge lies in computational scalability, especially with complex constraints and high-dimensional spaces, which the proposal acknowledges and plans to address using known techniques (sparse GPs, NNs). Modeling complex physical constraints accurately might also pose difficulties. Overall, the plan is realistic, but successful execution depends on managing computational costs and potential complexities in constraint modeling and data acquisition."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in materials science and other scientific discovery domains. Accelerating the discovery of *valid* materials by avoiding physically implausible candidates has major implications for reducing experimental costs and time. It directly tackles a key limitation of standard active learning methods in real-world scientific applications. Success would provide valuable practical tools for experimentalists and contribute theoretically to constrained optimization. The research aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of advancing adaptive experimental design for high-impact applications, potentially leading to faster breakthroughs in critical areas like energy and health."
