    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem highlighted in the task description: the lack of efficient hardware support for sparse neural network training and the resulting sustainability concerns. The proposed Adaptive Compute Fabric (ACF) and co-designed algorithms directly stem from the research idea. The proposal clearly positions itself relative to the cited literature (e.g., Procrustes, TensorDash), acknowledging prior work while outlining its distinct, co-design approach to tackle the identified challenges (irregularity, memory access, co-design gap)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, significance, and methodology are articulated concisely and logically. Algorithm 1 is presented clearly, and the hardware components (SCUs, IMCs, DIN) are described conceptually well. The implementation and evaluation plans are specific and easy to follow. Minor details about the DIN controller or the exact software-hardware interface could be elaborated, but these do not detract significantly from the overall excellent clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like zero-skipping or sparse memory formats exist, the core novelty lies in the proposed Adaptive Compute Fabric (ACF) architecture, particularly the Dynamic Interconnect Network (DIN) designed to reconfigure dataflows based on evolving sparsity patterns during training. Furthermore, the explicit focus on *co-designing* a specific block-structured dynamic sparse training algorithm *with* this adaptive hardware architecture distinguishes it from prior works that focused either primarily on hardware for fixed/simpler sparsity patterns or on algorithms independent of specific hardware adaptations. The combination and tight integration are innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established principles of sparse training, hardware acceleration, and co-design. The proposed hardware components directly target known bottlenecks (compute efficiency, memory bandwidth, data movement). The chosen algorithmic approach (block-structured dynamic sparsity) is justified by the need for hardware regularity while maintaining flexibility. The methodology includes standard rigorous evaluation techniques (cycle-level simulation, FPGA prototyping, diverse benchmarks, relevant metrics, ablation studies). The technical formulations provided are correct. While the complexity of the DIN and achieving the high claimed utilization are challenging, the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Designing and verifying the individual components (SCUs, IMCs) is achievable. However, the Dynamic Interconnect Network (DIN) adds considerable complexity, especially ensuring low-overhead reconfigurability. Implementing a 512-SCU system with a complex DIN on a single FPGA is ambitious and may face resource constraints or timing closure issues. The co-design aspect requires tight collaboration and iteration between hardware and algorithm teams. While conceptually feasible with significant expertise and resources, the scope is large and carries notable implementation risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely issue of computational and energy efficiency in large-scale DNN training, directly contributing to the goal of sustainable AI, as emphasized in the task description. Successfully demonstrating 3-5x speedups and energy reductions for sparse training would be a major advancement. The research could provide a valuable blueprint for future hardware accelerators, offer new insights into algorithm-hardware co-design for sparsity, and potentially accelerate the adoption of sparse training methods in practice, leading to substantial real-world impact."
