    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core task of bridging the gap between RL theory and practice by focusing on understanding and formalizing empirical heuristics, as outlined in the research idea. It effectively incorporates and builds upon key concepts and papers mentioned in the literature review (e.g., effective horizon, reward shaping theory, LLM heuristics, heuristic-guided planning), using them to motivate the research objectives and methodology. The proposal's goals of formalization, theoretical analysis, hybrid algorithm design, and validation directly correspond to the desiderata of communicating results and identifying problem structures where heuristics succeed or fail."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to specific objectives, a detailed methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly listed and unambiguous. The methodology section clearly outlines the steps, including the types of heuristics to be studied, the theoretical tools to be employed (regret analysis, bias-variance), the nature of the proposed hybrid algorithms, and a comprehensive validation plan with specific benchmarks, metrics, and baselines. Mathematical notations, where used, are introduced appropriately. The overall narrative is easy to follow and understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the general idea of analyzing heuristics and bridging the theory-practice gap is gaining traction (as evidenced by several 2023/2024 papers in the literature review), this proposal offers novelty through its systematic approach, the specific combination of diverse heuristics targeted (reward shaping, exploration, planning guidance including recent LLM approaches), and the concrete hybrid algorithms proposed (ARS, EHGE, LLM-enhanced planning with guarantees). Integrating concepts like the 'effective horizon' into the analysis of these heuristics and proposing specific mechanisms like meta-learning for reward shaping adds fresh perspectives. It's not groundbreaking in the sense of creating a new field, but it proposes a novel and comprehensive research program within an important emerging area."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established RL theory (MDPs, value functions, regret) and correctly identifies relevant theoretical concepts and prior work. The proposed methodology, involving formalization within MDP frameworks, theoretical analysis (regret bounds, bias-variance), and principled algorithm design, follows standard practices in theoretical machine learning. The references cited are appropriate and support the proposed direction. The inclusion of specific mathematical formulations (e.g., for PBRS, regret bounds, bias) demonstrates technical depth, although the actual derivations for complex scenarios remain a challenge, which is typical for a proposal. The plan to analyze under 'realistic assumptions' like bounded effective horizon is a strength."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the individual components (theoretical analysis, algorithm implementation, experiments) are standard research activities, the scope is ambitious. Deriving tight theoretical guarantees for heuristics combined with deep RL is notoriously difficult. Designing, implementing, and effectively tuning the proposed hybrid algorithms (especially ARS involving meta-learning and EHGE requiring dynamic estimation) could be complex. The experimental validation plan across diverse and complex environments (MuJoCo, NetHack, Minecraft) requires substantial engineering effort and computational resources. Success depends heavily on overcoming non-trivial theoretical and practical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged problem in the RL community: the disconnect between theoretical guarantees and the heuristics used in practice. Successfully reverse-engineering these heuristics and developing principled alternatives would represent a major advancement. It has the potential to lead to more robust, reliable, and generalizable RL algorithms, improve sample efficiency, reduce reliance on domain-specific tuning, and build trust for deploying RL in critical applications. The research directly contributes to the goals outlined in the task description and could catalyze collaboration between theorists and experimentalists."
