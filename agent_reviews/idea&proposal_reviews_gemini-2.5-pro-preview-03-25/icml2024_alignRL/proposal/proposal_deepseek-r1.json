    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description's goal of bridging the gap between RL theorists and experimentalists. It directly implements the research idea of reverse-engineering empirical heuristics to provide theoretical understanding. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the provided literature review, citing key papers (Doe & Smith, 2023; Johnson & Lee, 2023; Laidlaw et al., 2023; Wu, 2024) and directly addressing the challenges identified therein, such as the lack of theoretical justification for heuristics, sample efficiency, bias, and generalization issues."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-structured. The background, research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The methodology section effectively breaks down the analysis into specific heuristic types and outlines clear steps for formalization, theoretical derivation, algorithm design, and experimental validation. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of 'realistic conditions' for theoretical guarantees, but these do not significantly detract from the overall excellent clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While analyzing specific heuristics theoretically isn't entirely new (as shown in the literature review), the systematic approach of 'reverse-engineering' multiple common heuristics (reward shaping, exploration bonuses, LLM guidance) within a unified framework is innovative. The explicit goal of designing hybrid algorithms that replace heuristic components with theoretically principled ones, informed by the analysis, offers a fresh perspective. It builds upon recent work but proposes a distinct, synthetic approach to bridge the theory-practice gap."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, based on established RL principles (MDPs, Q-learning, regret analysis). The methodology outlines a logical progression from heuristic analysis to theoretical guarantees and algorithm design. The experimental plan is well-defined with appropriate baselines and metrics. However, deriving theoretical guarantees (sample complexity, regret bounds) for complex heuristics under 'realistic conditions' (implicitly, non-tabular settings with function approximation) is highly challenging and the proposal lacks specific details on the theoretical tools or assumptions required (e.g., specific function classes, structural assumptions). This ambition slightly tempers the soundness score, as achieving these guarantees rigorously is non-trivial."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The empirical aspects, including implementing algorithms and running experiments on standard benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo, Procgen), are practical with standard resources. The algorithm design component is also achievable. The primary challenge lies in the theoretical analysis, particularly deriving strong guarantees for heuristics in complex settings. This part is ambitious and may require significant effort or focusing on more restricted theoretical settings initially. The overall scope (three heuristic types, theory, design, experiments) is broad, potentially requiring careful project management or prioritization."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in RL: the persistent gap between theoretical understanding and empirical success driven by heuristics. Successfully formalizing these heuristics, providing theoretical guarantees, and developing robust hybrid algorithms would be a major contribution. It has the potential to unify the field, improve the trustworthiness and generalizability of RL systems for real-world deployment (especially in safety-critical domains), and foster more synergistic research between theorists and practitioners. The potential impact is substantial and clearly articulated."
