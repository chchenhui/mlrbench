    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of the theory-practice gap in RL, as outlined in the task description. The methodology systematically implements the research idea of reverse-engineering heuristics, analyzing them theoretically, and developing hybrid algorithms. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the themes and specific papers mentioned in the literature review (e.g., Laidlaw et al., Gehring et al., Cheng et al., and the general direction of analyzing heuristics theoretically), positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape focused on bridging this gap. The proposal's goals directly map onto the workshop desiderata of communicating results across communities and identifying problem structures relevant to practice."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly articulates the problem, the research gap, and the specific objectives. The methodology is broken down into logical, well-explained phases (Heuristic Identification, Theoretical Analysis, Algorithm Development, Experimental Validation), with concrete examples provided for key steps (e.g., formalizing reward shaping, analyzing Q-functions). The experimental plan is detailed and comprehensive. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the literature review indicates that analyzing RL heuristics theoretically and bridging the theory-practice gap is an active area with several recent contributions (including hypothetical ones suggesting current trends), this proposal's novelty lies in its systematic and comprehensive approach. It aims to create a taxonomy by analyzing multiple *categories* of heuristics (reward shaping, exploration, initialization, architecture/optimization) and explicitly focuses on *reverse-engineering* empirically successful heuristics to understand the *implicit assumptions* and *exploited structures*. The development of *hybrid* algorithms designed to replace heuristic components with theoretically grounded ones is a strong, practical contribution. While not entirely groundbreaking compared to the very latest (potentially concurrent) work cited, its scope and systematic methodology offer a fresh and valuable synthesis."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is well-grounded in established RL theory (MDPs, Q-learning, policy invariance, sample complexity). The proposed methodology for formalizing heuristics, conducting theoretical analysis (convergence, sample complexity), developing algorithms (e.g., learning potential functions, adaptive exploration), and experimental validation is robust and follows best practices. The technical formulations provided as examples are correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is thorough, including diverse environments, baselines, ablation studies, generalization tests, appropriate metrics, and statistical rigor. It acknowledges the need to build on recent theoretical work, demonstrating awareness of the required foundations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. The methodology is sound, and the steps are logical. However, the scope is broad, covering multiple heuristic categories and requiring extensive theoretical analysis and experimentation across numerous environments. Deriving meaningful theoretical guarantees for complex heuristics, especially those related to deep learning architectures or optimization schedules, can be very challenging and represents a significant risk. The experimental validation plan requires substantial computational resources and time. While feasible with adequate resources and expertise, the breadth might necessitate careful prioritization or potentially scaling back certain aspects to ensure completion within a realistic timeframe."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized problem in the RL community â€“ the gap between theory and practice. Successfully understanding why common heuristics work and developing theoretically grounded alternatives would be a major advancement. This could lead to more reliable, predictable, and generalizable RL systems, directly impacting practical applications. The potential scientific contributions (formal framework for heuristics, new theoretical guarantees, hybrid algorithms) and practical outcomes (better algorithm design, improved generalization) are substantial. The research directly contributes to the long-term vision of unifying RL research and developing structure-aware algorithms."
