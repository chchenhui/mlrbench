        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core task of bridging the gap between RL theory and practice by focusing on the theoretical understanding of empirically successful heuristics, as outlined in the research idea. The objectives (formalizing heuristics, identifying problem structures, deriving guarantees, developing hybrid algorithms, experimental validation) logically follow from the idea and task. The proposal effectively incorporates the context and challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as the lack of theoretical justification for heuristics, sample efficiency issues, and the need for better generalization, positioning the work appropriately within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Objectives, Significance, Methodology, Outcomes/Impact). The research objectives are explicitly listed and distinct. The methodology section breaks down the research plan into sequential, understandable steps (literature review, formalization, theoretical analysis, algorithm design, experimental validation) and specifies evaluation metrics. Minor ambiguities exist, such as not specifying exactly which 'commonly used heuristics' will be prioritized or the precise nature of 'principled components', but these are acceptable for a proposal stage. Overall, the proposal effectively communicates its goals and approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core idea of theoretically analyzing RL heuristics is not entirely new, as evidenced by several recent papers cited in the literature review (e.g., analyzing reward shaping, exploration bonuses, or generally bridging theory and practice). However, the proposal's emphasis on a *systematic* approach across potentially *multiple* heuristics, the specific focus on identifying the *problem structures* exploited, and the explicit goal of developing *hybrid algorithms* that replace heuristic parts with principled ones while maintaining/improving performance offer a degree of originality. It represents a structured synthesis and extension of existing trends rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in RL theory and practice. The proposed methodology (literature review, formalization, theoretical analysis, algorithm design, experimental validation) is logical and employs standard research techniques in the field. Using metrics like sample efficiency, regret, and generalization for evaluation is appropriate. The main challenge, acknowledged implicitly, lies in the difficulty of accurately formalizing potentially ill-defined heuristics and deriving tight theoretical guarantees under realistic (not overly simplified) conditions. Designing hybrid algorithms that provably work well is also non-trivial. However, the overall research plan is methodologically robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard RL theoretical techniques and experimental setups, requiring expertise and computational resources common in ML research labs. The steps outlined are logical and implementable. However, the feasibility depends significantly on the complexity of the chosen heuristics. Formalizing and analyzing complex, poorly understood heuristics could be very challenging and time-consuming. Deriving strong theoretical results might require significant theoretical insight. The scope might need to be narrowed (e.g., focusing on 1-2 specific heuristics initially) to ensure completion within a typical project timeframe. The primary risks are intellectual (difficulty of formalization/theory) rather than logistical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized problem in RL: the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding. Successfully understanding why heuristics work and developing principled alternatives could lead to more robust, generalizable, and trustworthy RL algorithms. This research has the potential to improve sample efficiency, reduce bias, and directly contribute to the task's goal of fostering collaboration and synergy between RL theorists and experimentalists. The outcomes could significantly influence future RL algorithm design and application."
