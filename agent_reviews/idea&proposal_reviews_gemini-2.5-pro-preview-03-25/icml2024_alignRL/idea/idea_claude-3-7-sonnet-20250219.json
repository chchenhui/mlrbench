    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for bridging the gap between RL theorists and experimentalists, facilitating communication, and identifying new problem classes or structures. The proposed 'benchmark translations' framework directly addresses this by creating a common ground and vocabulary for both communities, allowing theoretical settings to be tested practically and practical benchmarks to be analyzed theoretically. It aligns perfectly with the goal of fostering synergy and cross-disciplinary awareness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated. The motivation outlines the problem well, and the main idea explains the concept of bidirectional benchmark translations and dual leaderboards. The goal of creating a common vocabulary and facilitating mutual understanding is explicit and easy to grasp. While the core concept is clear, the specific methodology for creating 'faithful' translations that preserve essential properties could be elaborated further, but for a research idea description, the clarity is good."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While benchmarks and efforts to connect theory and practice exist, the proposed systematic, bidirectional framework for 'benchmark translations' coupled with dual (theoretical and practical) leaderboards offers a novel structure. Specifically, the emphasis on translating practical benchmarks back into simplified, theoretically tractable versions is a less common but valuable approach. It combines existing concepts (benchmarks, theoretical analysis, empirical evaluation) in a new, structured way aimed specifically at bridging the identified gap."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Designing meaningful and faithful translations between complex practical environments and simplified theoretical models (and vice-versa) requires deep expertise and careful validation. Building and maintaining the benchmark suite and leaderboards demands considerable engineering effort and resources. Furthermore, achieving broad community adoption and agreement on the translation methodologies and metrics would be crucial but potentially difficult. While conceptually sound, the practical execution requires substantial coordinated effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. The disconnect between RL theory and practice is a major bottleneck hindering progress in the field, as highlighted in the task description. Successfully implementing this framework could provide a crucial platform for validating theoretical assumptions, understanding empirical successes/failures, guiding the development of more robust algorithms, and fostering much-needed collaboration. It addresses a critical problem and could lead to major advancements by creating a stronger link between theoretical foundations and practical performance."
