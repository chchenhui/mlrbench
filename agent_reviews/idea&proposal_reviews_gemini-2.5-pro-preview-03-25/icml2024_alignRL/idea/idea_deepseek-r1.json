        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly aims to bridge the gap between RL theorists and experimentalists, which is the central theme and motivation of the proposed idea. The idea directly addresses the task's desiderata by proposing a method to 'Identify new problem classes of practical interest' through formalizing empirically successful heuristics, and it fosters communication by creating a framework that translates between empirical findings and theoretical assumptions. It tackles the core problem outlined in the task: the divergence between theoretical algorithms (often simplified or worst-case) and practical, heuristic-driven approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-defined, outlining the specific problem of the theory-practice gap. The main idea is broken down into a clear, sequential methodology (meta-analysis -> formalization -> algorithm design -> validation). Concrete examples (e.g., adaptive exploration, reward shaping) help illustrate the concepts. The expected outcomes and impact are explicitly stated. The proposal is concise and largely free of ambiguity, making the research direction easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While the goal of bridging RL theory and practice is common, the proposed methodology – systematically extracting patterns from successful empirical algorithms via meta-analysis and using these patterns to *define* new theoretical assumptions – offers a fresh perspective. It proposes a structured feedback loop from practice to theory, rather than just applying theory to practice or identifying gaps ad-hoc. This systematic formalization of empirical heuristics into theoretical constructs represents a significant innovation in approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The meta-analysis of diverse empirical RL methods is achievable but requires substantial effort and expertise. The most challenging step is translating potentially complex or vaguely defined heuristics into precise, mathematically tractable theoretical assumptions; this requires significant insight and may not always yield useful or generalizable results. Designing algorithms under new assumptions and validating them empirically are standard research activities and thus feasible. The core challenge lies in the successful execution of the formalization step."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. The gap between RL theory and practice is a major obstacle hindering the reliable application of RL in complex, real-world scenarios, especially safety-critical ones. Successfully developing a framework that produces algorithms with both strong empirical performance and theoretical guarantees (under realistic, empirically-derived assumptions) would be a major advancement. It could significantly increase trust in RL systems, accelerate adoption, and foster more productive collaboration within the RL community."
