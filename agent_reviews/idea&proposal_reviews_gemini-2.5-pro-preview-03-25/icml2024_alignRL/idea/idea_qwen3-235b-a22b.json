        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core problem outlined: the gap between RL theory and practice, particularly the reliance on heuristics lacking theoretical grounding. The idea's goal of analyzing *why* successful heuristics work and bridging the gap by informing theory with empirical practice directly supports the workshop's desiderata, especially 'Identify new problem classes of practical interest' by examining algorithms that work surprisingly well without theoretical understanding, and 'Communicate existing results' by translating empirical findings into theoretical insights."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (theory-practice gap), the main approach (systematic analysis, formalization, theoretical guarantees, hybrid algorithms, validation), and the overall goal (bridge gap, robust algorithms) are articulated concisely and logically. The example provided (reward shaping -> reward structure learning) effectively illustrates the proposed methodology. There is very little ambiguity about the research direction."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While analyzing specific heuristics theoretically isn't entirely new, the proposed systematic 'reverse-engineering' approach across a range of widely used heuristics, explicitly aiming to formalize their implicit assumptions and derive guarantees as a primary goal, presents a fresh perspective. The focus on creating hybrid algorithms by replacing heuristics with principled, theoretically-grounded components derived from this analysis adds to the innovation. It combines existing theoretical tools in a novel programmatic way focused on understanding empirical success."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant challenges. Theoretically analyzing complex heuristics, formalizing implicit assumptions accurately, and deriving meaningful guarantees under realistic (not overly simplified) conditions can be extremely difficult and may vary greatly depending on the heuristic. Designing principled replacements that match or exceed heuristic performance is also non-trivial. While the experimental validation part is standard, the core theoretical analysis requires deep expertise and potentially new theoretical developments. It's an ambitious program, likely requiring substantial time and effort, making it only satisfactorily feasible as a whole, though individual heuristic analyses might be more manageable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully bridging the gap between empirical heuristics and RL theory is a critical challenge in the field. Understanding why effective heuristics work can lead to more robust, reliable, and generalizable algorithms, moving beyond brittle, task-specific solutions. This research could provide fundamental insights into RL, guide the development of new algorithms, and increase trust in RL systems deployed in the real world. It directly addresses a major bottleneck hindering RL progress."
