        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking' topic listed under the TiFA task. It elaborates systematically on the research idea of cross-modal latent space watermarking for MMGMs. Furthermore, it clearly positions itself within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging recent advancements (e.g., InvisMark, GenPTW, Fernandez's thesis) and key challenges (cross-modality, robustness, security) identified in the review, aiming to address them directly. The focus on MMGMs like Sora fits the task's scope on advanced models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The background, objectives, significance, and overall methodology are well-articulated. The research stages are logically laid out. However, the technical details regarding the core watermarking mechanism lack depth. The mathematical formulation provided (simple addition in latent space) is overly simplistic for the complexity of the task (robust, imperceptible, cross-modal watermarking). How the watermark 'w' is designed, how it manifests reliably across diverse modalities, and the specific techniques for robust extraction are not sufficiently detailed, leaving some ambiguity about the precise technical approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While watermarking generative models and latent space manipulation are known concepts, the focus on developing a *unified* framework for *cross-modal* watermarking (text, image, video, audio) embedded *before* generation in the latent space of modern *MMGMs* (like Sora) is a novel research direction. It distinguishes itself from the cited literature which often focuses on single modalities (mostly images), specific model types, or different techniques (hashing, FHE). Although Fernandez's thesis (2025) touches on cross-modal watermarking, this proposal outlines a specific framework targeting the latest generation of MMGMs. The combination of these elements presents a fresh approach to a critical problem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has weaknesses in its technical rigor. The overall research plan (literature review, design, implementation, testing, validation) is standard. However, the core technical proposal, represented by the mathematical formulation \\( \\mathbf{z}_{\\text{watermarked}} = \\mathbf{z} + \\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf{w} \\), is too basic and likely insufficient for achieving robust, imperceptible, cross-modal watermarking. It fails to detail how it will overcome known challenges like adversarial attacks (Jiang et al., 2023) or the theoretical limitations of strong watermarking (Zhang et al., 2023), both mentioned in the literature review. A more sophisticated embedding strategy considering latent space structure and modality-specific decoders would be expected for a rigorous proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Accessing and modifying state-of-the-art MMGMs like Sora might be difficult. The computational cost of experimenting with and potentially retraining parts of these large models is substantial. The core technical challenge of creating a single watermark that robustly manifests across diverse modalities (text, image, video, audio) and survives both standard manipulations and dedicated attacks is extremely high, as highlighted by the literature. While the research steps are outlined, the complexity and potential roadblocks in achieving all objectives make the overall feasibility satisfactory rather than good or excellent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Establishing verifiable provenance for AI-generated content from powerful MMGMs is a critical need for combating misinformation, ensuring accountability, protecting intellectual property, and building trust in AI systems. This directly aligns with the goals of the TiFA task description. A successful outcome would represent a major advancement in AI safety and governance, providing a much-needed technical solution for tracing the origin of multi-modal AI outputs. The potential impact on the field and society is substantial."
