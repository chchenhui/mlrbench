    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the TiFA topic of 'Identifiers of AI-generated material' and the broader goals of accountability and regulation for trustworthy MFMs. It precisely follows the research idea of latent-space cross-modal watermarking. Furthermore, it effectively uses the literature review to identify the gap (lack of unified cross-modal solutions, robustness issues) and positions LatentMark as a specific solution, acknowledging relevant prior work and challenges (e.g., Xu et al., Gan et al., Fernandez, Zhang et al.)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research gap, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely and logically. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the proposed framework (watermark structure, embedding, decoding), training strategy (loss functions), and evaluation plan (metrics, baselines, transformations), leaving little ambiguity about the core concepts and research plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While watermarking generative models and exploring cross-modal aspects are not entirely new (citing Fernandez, GenPTW, InvisMark), the core idea of embedding the watermark into a *shared latent space* specifically to achieve *inherent cross-modal consistency* for provenance tracing in advanced MMGMs is a novel and distinct approach. It moves beyond modality-specific methods by targeting the common generative root. The novelty is clearly articulated and justified against the backdrop of existing literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established principles of digital watermarking, generative models (LDMs, Transformers), and deep learning. The proposed methodology, including latent space injection, modality-specific decoders, and the composite loss function for training (balancing quality, imperceptibility, decoding, robustness), is technically well-founded. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and includes appropriate metrics and security considerations. The proposal also commendably acknowledges the theoretical limitations of watermarking robustness (Zhang et al., 2023), aiming for practical security. A minor uncertainty lies in the practical extent to which a single latent watermark can be robustly decoded across highly diverse modalities without impacting quality, but the approach is theoretically coherent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. It relies on existing technologies and aims to use open-source models/datasets, which is practical. However, implementing the LatentMark framework requires sophisticated ML engineering, particularly integrating the embedding/decoding modules into complex MMGM architectures and managing the multi-objective training process. Achieving robust performance across multiple modalities simultaneously while maintaining high generative quality is ambitious. The extensive evaluation plan also requires substantial computational resources and effort. While achievable for a well-equipped research team, the implementation complexity and the challenge of balancing competing objectives warrant a 'Good' rather than 'Excellent' feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem â€“ the lack of reliable provenance tracking for content generated by powerful cross-modal AI models like Sora. This directly impacts efforts to combat deepfakes, misinformation, and ensure accountability, aligning perfectly with the TiFA program's goals. A successful outcome would provide a crucial technical tool for researchers, platforms, policymakers, and the public, potentially leading to major advancements in AI safety, governance, and trustworthy AI deployment. The focus on cross-modal consistency makes it particularly relevant for the future of generative AI."
