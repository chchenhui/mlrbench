    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (TiFA), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses the need for 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking' and tackles 'Novel safety challenges with the introduction of new modalities' as mentioned in the task description. It precisely follows the research idea of creating a unified, robust, latent-space watermarking framework for cross-modal provenance in MMGMs. Furthermore, it explicitly addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly the need for robust cross-modal watermarking, positioning itself as a solution to these recognized gaps (e.g., building on Fernandez's work but proposing a more concrete framework)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the stage effectively, the methodology is broken down into logical components (latent space embedding, robust embedding, detection, verification), and the evaluation plan is comprehensive. Mathematical notations are used, and an algorithm outline is provided. However, some technical details could be more precise, such as the exact mathematical formulation of the mapping functions G(.), B(.), and the fusion function F(.). The description of the human evaluation study is brief. Despite these minor points needing refinement, the overall objectives, methods, and rationale are well-articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While latent space watermarking and watermarking for individual modalities exist (as shown in the literature review, e.g., InvisMark, GenPTW), the core novelty lies in proposing a *unified* framework specifically designed for *cross-modal* provenance tracking in MFMs by embedding watermarks in the *shared latent space*. This approach directly tackles the cross-modal challenge highlighted in the literature (e.g., Fernandez). The combination of latent space embedding across different MFM architectures (diffusion, transformers) with modality-specific detectors fused into a unified system represents a fresh and significant contribution beyond single-modality or simpler cross-modal approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous. It builds upon established concepts like shared latent spaces in MFMs, error correction codes, encryption, and standard perceptual quality metrics. The proposed methodology (additive/attention embedding, modality-specific detection) is technically plausible. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and includes relevant metrics and robustness tests. However, the proposal doesn't explicitly address the theoretical impossibility results for strong watermarking mentioned in the literature (Zhang et al., 2023), which slightly weakens its theoretical grounding. Additionally, the exact design and guaranteed effectiveness of the mapping functions (G, B) and fusion function (F) across diverse models and modalities require significant empirical validation, representing a point of potential technical difficulty not fully mitigated in the proposal description."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Implementing watermarking by modifying core MFM components (denoising steps, attention layers) requires deep model access and expertise, especially for complex or closed models (like Sora). Integrating and testing across three different MFM types adds complexity. The large-scale dataset creation and comprehensive evaluation (including robustness and security testing) require substantial computational resources and time. While the plan is generally realistic using standard tools (PyTorch), the successful implementation hinges on overcoming non-trivial technical hurdles related to maintaining quality, achieving cross-modal robustness simultaneously, and potentially accessing/modifying state-of-the-art MFMs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and urgent problem: establishing the provenance of AI-generated content from increasingly powerful MFMs, which is crucial for combating misinformation, ensuring accountability, protecting IP, and fostering trust in AI. Existing methods struggle with cross-modal generation, a gap this proposal directly targets. A successful outcome would provide a vital technical tool for researchers, platforms, policymakers, and the public, potentially influencing industry standards and regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act). The potential contribution to trustworthy AI is substantial."
