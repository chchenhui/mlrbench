    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on trustworthy MFMs and the need for identifiers like watermarking. The proposal elaborates precisely on the research idea of a unified, latent-space, cross-modal watermarking system. It effectively incorporates and builds upon the cited literature, acknowledging recent works (InvisMark, GenPTW, Fernandez, VLPMarker) and key challenges (robustness, cross-modality, adversarial attacks, impossibility results) identified in the review. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all tightly linked to the initial problem statement and context."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed and unambiguous. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the proposed framework, including the embedding and decoding networks, training objective, adversarial augmentation, and code design, often accompanied by mathematical formulations. The experimental design is thorough, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablations. The structure is logical and easy to follow. A minor point of potential ambiguity lies in Section 2.3 describing the decoder as 'unified' and 'modality-agnostic' while also mentioning modality-specific architectures (CNN, 1D-CNN, Transformer) before weight sharing; however, the overall intent is understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While latent-space watermarking and cross-modal approaches exist (as acknowledged by citing Fernandez), the specific combination of embedding the watermark in the latent space *before* generation across four distinct modalities (text, image, audio, video) using modality-specific embedders but a *single, shared decoder* network appears novel. Furthermore, integrating modality-specific adversarial training within this unified latent framework to enhance robustness adds another layer of innovation. It clearly distinguishes itself from single-modality works (InvisMark, GenPTW) and V-L specific methods (VLPMarker)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in generative models, watermarking principles, and adversarial machine learning. The proposed methodology (latent perturbation, specific network architectures, composite loss function, PGD-based adversarial training, ECC codes) is technically well-founded. The inclusion of relevant baselines and comprehensive evaluation metrics strengthens the experimental design. The main uncertainty lies in the practical effectiveness of training a single decoder to robustly extract watermarks embedded via different mechanisms across diverse modalities and generative architectures; however, the proposed approach to achieve this (weight sharing, joint training) is plausible, making the overall methodology sound, pending empirical validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. It leverages standard frameworks (PyTorch, Hugging Face) and datasets. The required computational resources (A100 GPUs, 4-6 weeks) are substantial but typical for research involving large generative models. The methodology, while complex due to the multi-modal nature and joint training with adversarial components, consists of well-understood building blocks. The primary challenge and risk involve successfully training the unified decoder and achieving the desired robustness/imperceptibility trade-off across all modalities simultaneously, which requires careful implementation and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not seem insurmountable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: establishing provenance for content generated by increasingly powerful multi-modal AI models. This directly contributes to AI safety, trustworthiness, and accountability, tackling issues like misinformation, deepfakes, and copyright infringement. A successful unified, robust cross-modal watermarking framework would represent a major technical advancement with substantial practical implications for content platforms, regulators, and creators. The potential to influence industry standards further elevates its significance."
