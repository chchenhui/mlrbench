    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (TiFA), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking' for trustworthy MFMs/MMGMs. It faithfully expands on the research idea of a unified, robust, cross-modal latent space watermarking framework. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself within the provided literature, citing relevant works (e.g., InvisMark, GenPTW, VLPMarker as baselines, Jiang et al. on attacks [7], Zhang et al. on limitations [8]) and aiming to address key challenges identified in the review, such as cross-modal effectiveness and robustness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The algorithmic framework, including embedding, modality-specific injection, extraction, and training, is described with sufficient detail and mathematical notation. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise implementation details of functions like `Expand` or the specifics of spectral masking for audio, but these do not significantly hinder the overall comprehension of the proposed approach. The evaluation plan is clearly laid out."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While latent space watermarking and robustness techniques exist, the core novelty lies in proposing a *unified* framework specifically designed for *cross-modal generative models* (MMGMs like Sora, Stable Diffusion, MusicLM) covering text, image, video, *and* audio simultaneously via latent space embedding *before* generation. This unified approach across such diverse modalities, coupled with specific techniques (FFT for image/video, attention modification for text) and adversarial training for robustness, distinguishes it significantly from the cited literature which often focuses on single modalities, specific pairs (vision-language), or post-hoc methods. It offers a fresh perspective on tackling the cross-modal watermarking challenge for modern generative AI."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established principles of latent diffusion models, watermarking techniques, multi-task learning (fidelity, reconstruction, adversarial losses), and adversarial robustness training (PGD). The proposed methodology, including latent space injection and modality-specific adaptations, is technically plausible. The mathematical formulations are generally correct and clearly presented. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. The acknowledgement of theoretical limitations [8] and the focus on achieving *practical* robustness is a methodologically sound approach for empirical research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the underlying technologies exist, the scope (four modalities, multiple MMGMs including potentially restricted ones like Sora) is highly ambitious. It requires substantial computational resources for data generation (100k+ samples), training (especially with PGD), and evaluation. Integrating the watermarking framework seamlessly into diverse and complex MMGM pipelines without degrading generation quality requires significant engineering effort and expertise. Access to certain models might be limited. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation across all targeted modalities and models carries considerable risk and effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: establishing provenance for content generated by increasingly powerful MMGMs. This is crucial for combating misinformation, ensuring accountability, protecting intellectual property, and supporting regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act). A successful outcome would provide essential tools for AI safety and trustworthiness, potentially impacting platforms, policymakers, and the public. The expected contributions (framework, dataset, tools) would be substantial for the research community."
