    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (TiFA), the research idea, and the literature review. It directly addresses the need for 'identifiers of AI-generated material' and 'technical alignment for accountability' mentioned in TiFA. The core concept aligns perfectly with the research idea of a latent space-driven, cross-modal watermarking system. Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to tackle challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as cross-modal consistency, robustness against post-processing (Jiang et al., 2023), and adversarial attacks (Jiang et al., 2023), while also positioning itself relative to existing methods like InvisMark and GenPTW. It acknowledges theoretical limitations (Zhang et al., 2023) mentioned in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The research objectives (Cross-Modal Traceability, Robustness, Scalable Provenance) are explicitly stated and easy to understand. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the proposed architecture (encoder, injector, fusion network, decoder, detector), including specific technical formulations (loss functions, attention mechanism) and a clear training strategy. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive, outlining specific metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. The overall structure is logical and facilitates easy comprehension."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While latent space watermarking and cross-modal approaches exist (e.g., Fernandez, 2025; VLPMarker), the proposed unified framework combining latent space injection *prior* to generation with a dedicated transformer-based fusion network for ensuring cross-modal propagation appears innovative. The specific architecture designed to handle multiple modalities (text, image, video, audio) within a single framework, coupled with joint optimization against adversarial attacks, distinguishes it from prior work often focused on specific modalities (InvisMark, GenPTW) or different techniques (VLPMarker). The emphasis on a unified system for diverse MMGMs represents a novel contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in generative models (latent spaces, diffusion models), watermarking, deep learning (transformers, CNNs), and adversarial machine learning (PGD attacks, adversarial training). The proposed methodology, including the specific architectural components (injector, fusion network, detector) and the multi-task loss function incorporating perceptual, detection, and adversarial terms, is technically well-founded and justified. The evaluation plan employs standard and appropriate metrics (PSNR, SSIM, Bit Accuracy) and includes crucial comparisons and ablations. The technical formulations presented are correct and clearly described."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. While the individual components rely on existing technologies, integrating the proposed watermarking system (injector, fusion network) into diverse, potentially large-scale, and possibly proprietary MMGMs (like Sora) could be complex and require access to model internals. Training the multi-task objective effectively requires substantial computational resources and careful hyperparameter tuning. Achieving the targeted high robustness levels (>95% standard, >80% adversarial) across multiple modalities and against sophisticated, potentially unknown attacks is ambitious. Access to varied multi-modal datasets and MMGMs is also crucial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the lack of reliable provenance and attribution for content generated by advanced MMGMs. This directly impacts critical areas like misinformation mitigation, copyright enforcement, and regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act), aligning strongly with the TiFA task's goals. A successful outcome would provide a crucial technical tool for enhancing the trustworthiness of AI systems, potentially leading to major advancements in AI safety and accountability. The plan to release open-source tools further amplifies its potential impact."
