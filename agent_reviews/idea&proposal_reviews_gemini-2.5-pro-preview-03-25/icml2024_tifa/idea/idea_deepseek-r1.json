    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly lists 'Novel safety challenges with the introduction of new modalities' as a key topic. This research idea directly addresses this by focusing on vulnerabilities arising from integrating novel modalities (like 3D point clouds, thermal imaging) into Multi-Modal Foundation Models (MFMs). It also aligns perfectly with the task's broader emphasis on proactive risk assessment, mitigation, and safety evaluation for trustworthy MFMs and AI agents."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly articulates the problem of under-scrutinized risks in novel modalities. The main idea is broken down into three logical and understandable components: modality-specific threat modeling, cross-modal attack simulation, and modality-aware safeguards. The proposed validation strategy and expected outcomes are also clearly stated, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While research on MFM safety and adversarial attacks exists, this proposal specifically targets the vulnerabilities introduced by *novel* or less-common modalities (beyond standard text, image, audio) and their *cross-modal interactions*. Systematically analyzing threats like LiDAR spoofing or thermal data leakage within the context of MFMs, and developing tailored cross-modal attack simulations and defenses for these specific scenarios, represents a fresh and timely contribution to the field. It pushes beyond the current focus on more established modalities."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Threat modeling and developing mitigation techniques (anomaly detection, consistency checks) are standard research practices. However, implementing cross-modal attack simulations might require specialized datasets, simulators, or even hardware for modalities like LiDAR or thermal imaging. Accessing or developing MFMs that genuinely integrate these novel modalities effectively could also be a bottleneck, although the proposal acknowledges this by suggesting prototype MFMs. Overall, it's feasible with significant effort and potentially specialized resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. As MFMs are increasingly integrated into real-world systems like autonomous vehicles, robotics, and healthcare diagnostics, they will inevitably rely on diverse sensors beyond traditional modalities. Understanding and mitigating the unique vulnerabilities introduced by these sensors (e.g., 3D, thermal, depth) is critical for ensuring the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of these applications. Proactively addressing these risks, as proposed, could prevent serious failures and build confidence in deploying advanced AI systems in sensitive domains."
