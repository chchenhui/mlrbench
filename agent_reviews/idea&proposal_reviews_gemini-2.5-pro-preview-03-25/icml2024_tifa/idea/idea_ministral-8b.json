    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core need for 'proactive risk assessment, mitigation, safeguards, and the establishment of comprehensive safety mechanisms throughout the lifecycle' for MFMs and AI Agents. It explicitly incorporates the required 'blend of technical and socio-technical strategies' and mentions several specific topics listed in the task description, such as robustness to spurious correlations, uncertainty estimation, fairness, accountability, regulation, scalable oversight, representation control, machine unlearning, model auditing, red-teaming, and safety evaluation benchmarks. The focus on MFMs and AI Agents is central, matching the task's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-defined. The motivation, main idea, key components (Risk Identification, Assessment, Mitigation, Lifecycle Integration), and expected outcomes are articulated logically. Each component's purpose is explained, providing a good understanding of the proposed framework's structure and function. While specific algorithmic details are omitted (as expected in an idea summary), the overall concept is mostly clear and understandable with only minor ambiguities regarding the precise integration mechanisms between modules."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like risk assessment, model auditing, or red-teaming exist, the novelty lies in proposing a *comprehensive, integrated, proactive framework* specifically tailored to the unique challenges of *MFMs and AI Agents* across their entire lifecycle. The synthesis of ML-based identification, multi-faceted technical/socio-technical assessment, and modern mitigation techniques (like scalable oversight, machine unlearning) within a single, proactive structure offers a fresh perspective compared to applying these techniques piecemeal or reactively. It's a novel combination and application focus rather than a fundamentally new technique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing robust ML techniques for proactive vulnerability identification in complex MFMs is an ongoing research area. Creating a multi-faceted assessment module that accurately quantifies and integrates diverse technical and socio-technical risks is complex. Implementing and validating the effectiveness of all proposed mitigation strategies, especially newer ones, requires substantial effort. Integrating the framework seamlessly across the entire MFM/AI Agent lifecycle demands significant engineering effort and organizational adoption. While conceptually sound, practical implementation requires considerable resources, expertise, and potential advancements in sub-fields."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Ensuring the trustworthiness and safety of advanced MFMs and AI Agents is a critical challenge with broad societal implications, as highlighted in the task description. A proactive, comprehensive risk assessment framework directly addresses this challenge. If successful, it could lead to major advancements in AI safety practices, significantly reduce potential harms, build public trust, and provide essential tools for AI governance and regulation. It tackles a core problem in the responsible development and deployment of cutting-edge AI."
