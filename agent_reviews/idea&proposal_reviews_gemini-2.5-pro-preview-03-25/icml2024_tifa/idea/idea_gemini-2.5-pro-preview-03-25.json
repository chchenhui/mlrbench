        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses one of the key topics listed in the task description: 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking'. It focuses on Multi-modal Generative Models (MMGMs), which are explicitly mentioned as a core component of the task's scope (MFMs). Furthermore, the motivation aligns perfectly with the task's goal of building 'Trustworthy MFMs' by tackling issues of accountability and combating misinformation stemming from AI-generated content."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (need for provenance in MMGMs), the core technical proposal (unified latent space watermarking before generation), the desired properties (cross-modal, robustness, decodability), and the intended outcome (verifiable provenance). The concept is articulated concisely and leaves little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While watermarking AI content and latent space manipulation are existing research areas, the proposed idea offers notable originality. The key novelty lies in the concept of a *unified* framework embedding a *single* watermark in the latent space *before* generation, designed to manifest robustly across *multiple* output modalities (text, image, video, audio) generated from that latent representation. This cross-modal consistency from a single source and pre-generation embedding for MMGMs offers a fresh perspective compared to modality-specific or post-hoc watermarking techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The core concept of embedding information into latent spaces is technically feasible. However, achieving the desired level of robustness against a wide range of manipulations (compression, cropping, format changes, potentially adversarial attacks) simultaneously across diverse modalities (video, audio, image, text) presents significant technical challenges. Developing decoders effective on partial or degraded content adds complexity. Implementation also likely requires access to the internal workings (latent spaces) of MMGMs, which might be straightforward for open models or during training but difficult for closed, pre-trained systems. While challenging, it appears largely feasible within the current research landscape, requiring significant engineering and research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a highly significant and increasingly critical problem: the reliable identification and provenance tracking of AI-generated content, especially from sophisticated MMGMs. As these models become more prevalent and capable, the potential for misuse (e.g., deepfakes, misinformation) grows. A robust, cross-modal watermarking system would be a major contribution towards establishing accountability, combating misuse, and building trust in AI systems, directly aligning with the core goals of the TiFA task."
