    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core research idea of using counterfactually guided fine-tuning to enhance LLM robustness against spurious correlations. It fits perfectly within the task description's theme of 'Causality for large models' by proposing a method to improve LLMs using causal principles, specifically targeting the challenge of trustworthiness and robustness (Question B). The proposal effectively synthesizes the provided literature, citing relevant papers (Jin et al., Kıcıman et al., Doe & Smith, Johnson & Lee, Brown & Green, White & Black, Wu et al., Purple & Yellow) and explicitly positioning itself to address the identified gap of a unified pipeline integrating SCMs, automated counterfactual generation, and end-to-end fine-tuning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section is particularly strong, outlining a logical four-stage pipeline with clear descriptions of the SCM, the counterfactual generation process (including prompt examples and validation steps), the mathematical formulation of the loss function, the algorithmic steps, and a comprehensive experimental design. The structure is logical, making the proposal easy to follow and understand without ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing a specific, unified pipeline that integrates several existing concepts in a new way. While counterfactual data augmentation and causal fine-tuning have been explored (as noted in the literature review), the combination of using a formal SCM to guide automated *textual* counterfactual generation via prompting, validating these generations with auxiliary classifiers, and employing a specific KL-divergence based counterfactual consistency loss for end-to-end fine-tuning appears novel. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by aiming for this integrated, automated approach, addressing a specific gap identified in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound theoretical foundations from causal inference (SCMs, counterfactuals) and standard machine learning practices (fine-tuning, cross-entropy, KL divergence). The proposed SCM is simple but appropriate for the target problem. The methodology is rigorous, particularly with the inclusion of validation steps (using classifiers C_phi and D_psi) for the generated counterfactuals. The joint loss function is well-motivated to encourage consistency. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics, ablations, and statistical analysis. A potential minor weakness lies in the practical challenge of ensuring high-fidelity 'minimal rewrites' via prompting, but the overall approach is well-justified and technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible. The methodology relies on established techniques like LLM fine-tuning, prompting large models, and training classifiers. Identifying spurious correlates (S) and true causes (A) might require domain expertise or careful annotation, but the proposal plans to use existing benchmarks where such information is often available or inferable, and includes ablation on identification methods. The counterfactual generation via prompting is technically feasible with current LLMs. The provided compute resource estimate seems realistic for the described model size and task. The main risk involves the quality control of generated counterfactuals, but the proposed validation step mitigates this, making the overall plan practical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of robustness and potential unfairness of LLMs due to reliance on spurious correlations. Improving model reliability under distribution shifts and for high-stakes applications (healthcare, law, etc.) is a critical research goal, directly aligning with the motivation in the task description. Success would lead to more trustworthy AI systems, provide a practical method for instilling causal biases in LLMs, and potentially release valuable resources (code, datasets) to the community. The potential impact on both the research field and real-world applications is substantial."
