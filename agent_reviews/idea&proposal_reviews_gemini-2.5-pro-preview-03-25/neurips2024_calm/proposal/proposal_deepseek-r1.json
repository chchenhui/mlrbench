    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on 'Causality for large models' by proposing a method to improve LLM trustworthiness and robustness using causal principles (counterfactual invariance). It faithfully implements the core research idea of counterfactually guided fine-tuning based on causal graphs. Furthermore, it appropriately situates itself within the provided literature, acknowledging limitations of LLMs (Jin et al., Kıcıman et al.), building on counterfactual techniques (Doe & Smith, Johnson & Lee), and aiming to improve robustness (White & Black) through a specific fine-tuning mechanism potentially distinct from general causal fine-tuning (Brown & Green). All components are well-integrated and consistent."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology is broken down into logical stages (identification, generation, fine-tuning) with clear descriptions. The proposed loss function is explicitly stated. The experimental design is detailed, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and implementation parameters. The expected outcomes are quantified. There are minor potential ambiguities in the exact implementation of 'automated causal discovery tools' or 'LLM-based rewriting', but the overall research plan, rationale, and methodology are immediately understandable and presented with high clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty. While building on existing concepts like counterfactual data augmentation (Doe & Smith) and fairness fine-tuning (Johnson & Lee), and aligning with general directions in causal fine-tuning (Brown & Green), it proposes a specific mechanism that appears distinct. The core novelty lies in the combination of: 1) generating counterfactuals by intervening on the identified causal feature (X) while holding the spurious correlate (S) fixed, based on a simplified causal graph, and 2) using a consistency loss (KL divergence) between factual and counterfactual predictions during fine-tuning to explicitly enforce invariance to S. This specific formulation targeting robustness via causal invariance seems a novel refinement over existing methods mentioned in the literature review. It's an innovative application and combination of ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the causal principle of invariance: predictions should depend on causal factors, not spurious ones. The proposed method operationalizes this by penalizing prediction changes when the causal factor is altered but the spurious one is kept constant. The methodology follows a logical progression, and the experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant datasets, strong baselines, and appropriate metrics (OOD, fairness, causality). The use of KL divergence is standard and appropriate. Potential weaknesses lie in the assumptions: the ability to reliably identify the correct (even if simplified) causal graph and generate high-quality, minimal counterfactuals automatically. The chosen causal graph structure (Y \\\\leftarrow X \\\\rightarrow S \\\\rightarrow Y_{\\\\text{spurious}}) might be too simple for some complex real-world scenarios, but serves as a reasonable starting point."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core fine-tuning process using LLaMA-2-7B with LoRA and a custom loss function is standard and achievable with typical academic compute resources. The proposed datasets are mostly public benchmarks. However, significant challenges exist in Stage 1 (identifying spurious correlations and defining the causal graph accurately, especially using automated tools) and Stage 2 (automatically generating high-quality counterfactual examples that minimally change X while perfectly preserving S). These stages require careful engineering and validation, potentially consuming considerable effort. Accessing specific medical notes might also pose challenges. While achievable, these data preparation steps introduce moderate implementation risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged problem in contemporary AI: the lack of robustness and trustworthiness in LLMs due to their tendency to learn spurious correlations. Improving robustness, particularly under distribution shifts and in safety-critical domains like healthcare and policy-making (as mentioned in the task description), is of paramount importance. By proposing a method grounded in causal principles to mitigate these issues, the research has the potential to make substantial contributions to building more reliable and fair AI systems. Success would represent a meaningful step towards integrating causal reasoning into large-scale models, impacting both research and practical deployment."
