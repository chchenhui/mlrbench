        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the challenge of improving Large Language Model (LLM) trustworthiness and robustness under distribution shifts (question B: 'Under what circumstances can we trust these large models and how can this be improved?'). It proposes using causal concepts (interventions, counterfactuals) to mitigate reliance on spurious correlations, which is a core theme. The method falls squarely under the workshop topic 'Causality for large models: Applying ideas from causality to augment and improve large models'. It also tackles the practical challenge mentioned in the task description of applying causal tools to large models without necessarily requiring extensive external data."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main two-stage approach (Intervention Generation and Distillation), and expected outcomes are clearly presented. The core concept of self-generating counterfactuals via interventions on identified latent variables and then distilling this knowledge is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of 'prompt-based causal probing', the exact nature of the 'lightweight discriminator', and the precise formulation of the 'contrastive consistency objective', but these are details that would typically be elaborated in a full paper. The overall research direction is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using interventions or distillation for robustness isn't entirely new, the core novelty lies in the 'self-interventional' aspect applied to large models. The proposed method for the model to identify potential causal variables via probing, algorithmically generate its own counterfactual interventions, filter them, and then learn from them via distillation represents a fresh combination and application of existing techniques. This self-supervised approach to infusing causal robustness without relying on external counterfactual datasets is innovative, especially in the context of large-scale models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology. Prompting LLMs, performing algorithmic text manipulations (negation, swaps), training lightweight discriminators, and finetuning models with contrastive losses are all established techniques. The main challenges lie in the effectiveness of 'prompt-based causal probing' to reliably identify meaningful latent variables for intervention, ensuring the quality and plausibility of the algorithmically generated counterfactuals, and the computational cost associated with generating large amounts of data and finetuning the LLM. While challenging, these aspects seem addressable with careful engineering and experimentation, making the overall idea practical to implement, albeit potentially resource-intensive."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized problem in LLMs: their lack of robustness and tendency to rely on spurious correlations, hindering their trustworthiness, especially in safety-critical applications mentioned in the task description. Developing scalable methods to improve OOD generalization and causal faithfulness without expensive human annotation could lead to major advancements in deploying reliable LLMs. Success would represent a substantial contribution to making LLMs more trustworthy and robust, directly aligning with the goals outlined in the task description."
