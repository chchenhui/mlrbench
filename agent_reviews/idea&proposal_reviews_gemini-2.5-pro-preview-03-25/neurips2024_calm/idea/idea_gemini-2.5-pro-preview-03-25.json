        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the challenge of LLM robustness and trustworthiness under distribution shifts, which is central to Question B ('Under what circumstances can we trust these large models and how can this be improved?'). It proposes using causality (specifically, counterfactuals) to improve LLMs, fitting perfectly into the workshop topic 'Causality for large models'. The motivation aligns well with the task's emphasis on moving beyond spurious correlations towards stable causal relationships for reliable deployment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The core idea of using counterfactually guided fine-tuning is mostly clear. The motivation and the general approach (identify spurious correlations, generate counterfactual pairs based on a causal graph, fine-tune) are well-articulated. However, key operational details lack precision: how spurious correlations are identified systematically, how the 'simplified causal graph' is defined and utilized, the exact mechanism for 'automatically generating' minimal counterfactual text pairs, and the specific nature of the loss function. These ambiguities slightly hinder a complete understanding of the proposed method's specifics."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using counterfactuals for robustness or fairness isn't entirely new in machine learning, its specific application to LLM fine-tuning guided by automatically generated textual counterfactuals derived from an explicit (simplified) causal graph represents a fresh approach. It combines concepts from causal inference, counterfactual reasoning, and LLM fine-tuning in a specific configuration aimed at mitigating spurious correlations learned during pre-training. It moves beyond simply evaluating causal reasoning *in* LLMs to actively using causal principles *for* improving them."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Fine-tuning LLMs is standard, but the core difficulties lie in: 1) Reliably identifying relevant spurious correlations and defining appropriate causal graphs for complex, high-dimensional text data. 2) Automatically generating high-quality, controlled counterfactual text pairs that minimally alter the 'cause' while preserving the 'spurious correlate' â€“ this is a challenging generative task itself. 3) Ensuring the fine-tuning process effectively instills the desired causal invariance without degrading general performance. While conceptually sound, the practical execution requires overcoming non-trivial technical hurdles, particularly in the automated generation and causal modeling steps."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Addressing the brittleness of LLMs due to spurious correlations is a critical challenge for their safe and reliable deployment in real-world applications, especially high-stakes domains mentioned in the task (healthcare, policy-making). Improving out-of-distribution generalization and fairness by encouraging models to rely on more stable, causal relationships would be a major advancement. Success in this research direction could substantially increase the trustworthiness and utility of LLMs, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the task description."
