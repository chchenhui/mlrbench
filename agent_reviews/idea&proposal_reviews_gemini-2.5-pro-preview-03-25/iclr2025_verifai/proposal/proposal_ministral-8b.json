    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (VerifAI workshop theme on Generative AI for formal methods), the research idea (LLM-TAC framework), and the literature review (building on recent work like LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA and addressing identified challenges). It directly targets the use of LLMs to enhance interactive theorem proving by automating tactic generation, which is a core topic for the workshop. The methodology follows the steps outlined in the idea, and the objectives address challenges mentioned in the literature review, such as context encoding and tactic generation accuracy."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The background, objectives, high-level methodology (encoding, generation/verification, RL loop), experimental design, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally understandable. However, the technical details within the methodology lack depth. The formalizations provided (e.g., f(G,S), g(Goal State)) are placeholders and do not offer significant insight. Specific choices for the retrieval mechanism, LLM architecture, RL algorithm, and reward function design are not detailed, leaving some ambiguity regarding the precise implementation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates satisfactory novelty. While using LLMs for theorem proving tasks (tactic suggestion, premise selection) is an active area with recent contributions (LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA, Lean Copilot cited in the review), this proposal combines retrieval-augmented context encoding, tactic sequence generation, prover execution feedback, and an explicit reinforcement learning loop for refinement. This specific combination, particularly the RL aspect applied to tactic sequences based on prover success/failure, and the potential application to Coq (alongside Lean), offers a novel synthesis and extension of existing ideas. However, it's more of an incremental/combinatorial novelty rather than a groundbreaking concept, as components like retrieval and execution feedback have appeared in prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, relying on established concepts like LLMs, retrieval augmentation, ITP interaction, and reinforcement learning. The overall approach of using prover feedback to improve generation is logical. However, the proposal lacks methodological rigor and technical depth. The formalizations are superficial and don't demonstrate technical correctness. Key details regarding the specific RL algorithm, reward function design (crucial for RL success), state/action space representation for tactics, handling of syntactically incorrect tactics, and the specifics of the retrieval mechanism are missing. This lack of detail makes it difficult to fully assess the robustness of the proposed method and raises concerns about potential unaddressed technical challenges."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing technologies (LLMs, ITPs like Coq/Lean, RL libraries) and builds upon prior work demonstrating LLM-ITP integration. Standard benchmarks (mathcomp, stdlib) are available. Data generation through interaction with the prover is plausible. However, significant engineering effort will be required to integrate the components (RAG, LLM, ITP interface, RL agent) robustly. Interfacing with Coq/Lean can be complex. The computational cost of the RL loop, involving potentially numerous prover calls for exploration and training, could be substantial. Achieving the ambitious 50% reduction target presents a notable challenge."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Automating tactic generation addresses a major bottleneck in interactive theorem proving, which currently hinders the scalability and wider adoption of formal methods in mathematics and software verification. Success in this research could dramatically accelerate proof development, lower the barrier to entry for formal methods, and enhance the productivity of researchers and engineers. The potential impact on the formal methods community is substantial, aligning well with the goals of bridging AI and verification."
