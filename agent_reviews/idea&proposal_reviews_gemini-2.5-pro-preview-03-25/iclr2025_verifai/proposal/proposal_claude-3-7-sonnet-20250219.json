    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (VerifAI workshop focus on bridging AI and formal methods, specifically generative AI for formal methods), the research idea (LLM-guided tactic autogeneration using encoding, generation/verification, and RL), and the literature review (acknowledging prior work like LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA and addressing identified challenges like context encoding and feedback integration). It directly tackles the workshop's themes by proposing an LLM-based system to aid interactive theorem proving, a core formal method."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the objectives. The methodology section meticulously details the three core components (Contextual Encoding, Tactic Generation, RL from Verification Feedback) with specific steps and even relevant mathematical formulations. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are explicitly laid out. The structure is logical, and the language is precise, making the proposal easy to understand for someone familiar with the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using LLMs for theorem proving assistance (LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA) and employing retrieval augmentation are established concepts mentioned in the literature review, the specific combination proposed in LLM-TAC, particularly the explicit closed-loop reinforcement learning (REINFORCE) mechanism using fine-grained verification feedback (success, partial success, failure) as rewards to update the policy, appears to be a novel contribution compared to the cited works which often rely more on supervised fine-tuning or simpler feedback mechanisms within in-context learning or search. The generation of counter-examples from failures for retraining also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation, interactive theorem proving, and reinforcement learning (specifically policy gradients/REINFORCE). The methodology is well-justified, breaking down the complex problem into manageable, technically grounded steps. The use of formal verification (executing tactics in the prover) to generate feedback/rewards for the RL loop is a robust approach. The technical formulations for encoding, ranking, reward, and RL updates are clearly presented and appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. It requires access to powerful LLMs (e.g., Llama 3 70B, GPT-4) and significant computational resources for fine-tuning, inference, and especially the RL loop which involves repeated interaction with the theorem prover. Integrating LLMs with ITPs (Coq, Lean) is complex but proven possible by prior work. Curating initial training data and implementing the full pipeline (retrieval, generation, verification, RL) requires substantial engineering effort and expertise in both ML and ITP. The comprehensive evaluation plan, including a user study, adds to the workload. However, the steps are based on existing technologies and methods, making it achievable with adequate resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in formal methods â€“ the difficulty and tedium of manual tactic engineering in ITPs. Successfully automating or significantly assisting this process could dramatically lower the barrier to entry for formal verification, accelerate the development of verified software and formalized mathematics, and broaden the adoption of these powerful techniques. The research directly contributes to the important intersection of AI and formal methods, aligning perfectly with the VerifAI workshop's goals. The expected outcomes, if achieved, would represent a major advancement in the field."
