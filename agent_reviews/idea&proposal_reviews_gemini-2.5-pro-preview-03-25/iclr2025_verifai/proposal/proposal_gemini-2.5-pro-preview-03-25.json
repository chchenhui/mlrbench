    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the VerifAI workshop's theme of 'Generative AI for formal methods' by proposing an LLM-based solution to automate tactic generation in ITPs. It faithfully expands on the core research idea (LLM-TAC framework using fine-tuning, retrieval, ITP verification, and RL). Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA, Lean Copilot), acknowledging key challenges identified in prior work (context encoding, tactic accuracy, ITP integration, data, generalization) and proposing specific methods (retrieval augmentation, RL from ITP feedback) to address them. The proposal also connects to the special theme of 'LLMs for Code Generation' by framing tactics as the 'code' of formal proofs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and highly detailed. The background, problem statement, proposed solution (LLM-TAC), research objectives, significance, and methodology are articulated precisely and logically. The two-stage approach (SFT + RL) combined with ITP verification is explained clearly. The methodology section provides specific details on data sources, encoding techniques (retrieval augmentation), model choices (Code Llama), training procedures (SFT, PPO RL), ITP interaction mechanisms (serapi, lean-client-python), and a comprehensive evaluation plan with concrete metrics and baselines. Minor details like the exact benchmark subsets or final reward function parameters are understandably left open, but the overall research plan is exceptionally well-defined and easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While leveraging existing concepts like LLMs for theorem proving (LeanDojo, LLMSTEP, COPRA), retrieval augmentation (LeanDojo), and RL for LLMs (Ouyang et al., 2022), the core novelty lies in the specific integrated framework (LLM-TAC) that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (PPO) directly using feedback (success/failure/progress) from the ITP execution loop to optimize *tactic sequence generation*. This tight coupling of generation, formal verification, and RL-based policy refinement specifically for multi-step tactic synthesis in both Coq and Lean distinguishes it from prior work, which often focuses on single-step suggestions, premise selection, or relies more heavily on in-context learning with general models without the explicit RL fine-tuning loop driven by ITP feedback proposed here. The focus on generating *sequences* and optimizing them via RL is a key innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in both machine learning (LLMs, SFT, RL, PPO, retrieval) and formal methods (ITPs, proof states, tactics). The proposed methodology is robust: using large proof corpora for initial training, employing standard retrieval techniques for context, choosing appropriate base models (Code Llama), using a well-established RL algorithm (PPO), and critically, leveraging the ITP itself as a perfect, deterministic verifier within the feedback loop. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant metrics, strong baselines, and necessary ablation studies. Technical formulations (SFT/PPO objectives) are correctly presented conceptually. The acknowledgment of potential challenges like reward engineering demonstrates methodological foresight."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant engineering challenges. Required components like pre-trained LLMs (Code Llama), fine-tuning/RL libraries, and retrieval tools are readily available. Large proof corpora exist, although parsing them accurately requires effort. The main feasibility challenge lies in building robust, bidirectional interfaces with Coq (via serapi/coq-lsp) and Lean (via lean-client-python/LeanDojo-like tools) to reliably extract proof states, execute generated tactics, and parse diverse feedback (success, various errors, new states). This requires substantial engineering effort and expertise in ITP internals. Furthermore, RL training for large models can be computationally expensive and potentially unstable, requiring careful implementation and tuning (though mitigation strategies like LoRA are mentioned). While ambitious, the project is plausible within a well-resourced research setting."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the manual bottleneck in interactive theorem proving, which hinders the scalability and adoption of formal methods. Successfully automating tactic generation via LLM-TAC could have a major impact by substantially accelerating formal verification efforts, making ITPs more accessible to a wider audience (democratization), and enabling the verification of larger, more complex systems. It represents a strong example of synergistic AI-Formal Methods collaboration, directly aligning with the VerifAI workshop's goals. The research also contributes novel techniques for applying AI to structured formal languages and promises valuable open-source artifacts (models, code, benchmarks) for the community."
