        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Formal methods for generative AI' and even provides 'automata simulators can steer AI generations towards more logically consistent behavior' as an example. This research idea directly proposes using runtime formal monitoring (automata, temporal logic) to steer LLMs towards logical consistency during generation, fitting squarely within the workshop's scope and addressing one of its key suggested angles."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (LLM logical inconsistency), the core mechanism (runtime formal monitoring integrated into generation), the components involved (formal specifications, monitor, feedback, steering), and the expected outcome (more consistent and reliable LLMs). The distinction from post-hoc checking is explicit. Minor details about the exact implementation of the feedback translation could be further specified, but the overall concept is exceptionally well-articulated and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While post-hoc verification and constrained decoding exist, the concept of integrating runtime monitoring based on formal specifications (like temporal logic or automata) *during* token-by-token generation to actively *steer* the LLM's sampling process towards logical consistency is innovative. It combines runtime verification techniques with generative model control in a novel way, going beyond simple grammatical constraints or domain-specific checks often seen in constrained decoding."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Key hurdles include: 1) The computational overhead of runtime monitoring complex formal properties for every generated token, which could drastically slow down generation. 2) Developing effective methods to translate abstract feedback from the formal monitor (e.g., 'potential future violation') into concrete adjustments of the LLM's next-token probability distribution. 3) The difficulty of authoring comprehensive formal specifications for complex notions of 'logical consistency'. While not impossible, significant research and engineering effort, potentially involving approximations or focusing on simpler properties initially, would be required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Logical inconsistency is a major barrier to the trustworthy deployment of LLMs in critical domains requiring reliability and complex reasoning (e.g., science, law, coding, planning). Successfully developing methods to enforce logical consistency or adherence to formal constraints during generation would represent a major advancement in LLM reliability and safety, potentially unlocking new applications and increasing user trust. It addresses a core problem at the intersection of AI and formal methods."
