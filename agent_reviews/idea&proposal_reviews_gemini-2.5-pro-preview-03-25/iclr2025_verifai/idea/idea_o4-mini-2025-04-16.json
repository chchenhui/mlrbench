        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (VerifAI workshop). It directly addresses the theme 'Generative AI for formal methods' by proposing the use of LLMs to automate tactic generation in Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) like Coq or Lean, aiming to guide the proof search process. It also touches upon using verification feedback (from the prover) to improve the AI model via reinforcement learning, linking formal methods back to AI improvement. The goal of reducing manual effort in ITPs fits perfectly within the workshop's scope of bridging generative AI and formal verification challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It outlines a specific two-stage framework (LLM-TAC) involving contextual encoding, tactic generation/verification, and a reinforcement learning loop. The motivation, core components, expected outcomes (quantified reduction target, public release), and potential impact are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. While implementation details are high-level, the overall concept and workflow are immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Using LLMs for theorem proving and tactic generation is an active research area with several existing works exploring similar directions (e.g., using LLMs to suggest tactics, proof steps, or even full proofs). The proposed combination of retrieval augmentation for context, LLM-based generation, mechanical verification feedback, and an RL loop represents a sound integration of current techniques rather than a groundbreaking new paradigm. The specific two-stage architecture and focus on iterative refinement offer some originality, but the core concept builds heavily on recent trends."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It relies on existing technologies: LLMs, fine-tuning techniques, ITP systems (Coq, Lean), and reinforcement learning frameworks. Integrating these components and setting up the feedback loop is technically involved but achievable with current ML and formal methods expertise. Access to computational resources for LLM training/fine-tuning and running the ITP repeatedly is necessary but standard for this type of research. The main challenge lies in achieving the ambitious 50% reduction target, which depends on the effectiveness of the LLM guidance and the RL training process."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Automating tactic generation addresses a major bottleneck in interactive theorem proving, which currently requires significant human expertise and effort. Success in this area could substantially accelerate the formal verification of software and hardware, as well as the formalization of mathematics. Lowering the barrier to entry for ITPs could broaden their adoption, contributing meaningfully to the fields of formal methods and software engineering, aligning well with the goals of reliable and verifiable AI systems."
