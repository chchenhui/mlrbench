    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's call for papers. It directly addresses several solicited topics: 'Methods for discovering and diagnosing spurious correlations' (via automated causal discovery), 'Learning robust models in the presence of spurious correlations' (via causal invariance loss), and 'Exploring relationships b/n methods from causal ML... and OOD generalization' (by integrating causal discovery with invariance for OOD robustness). The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's theme, citing examples (radiology, genomics) similar to those mentioned in the call and focusing on the failure modes of models relying on spurious features."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. It outlines a two-stage pipeline (discovery and mitigation) with specific techniques mentioned (score-based causal discovery, causal invariance loss, generative models for perturbations). The motivation, goals, and expected outcomes are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact implementation details, such as how score-based causal discovery scales to high-dimensional raw data or the precise formulation of the causal invariance loss, but the overall concept and workflow are understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty through the proposed integration of techniques. While components like causal discovery, invariance learning, and counterfactual generation exist, the specific pipeline (CIT) that automates the discovery of spurious features using score-based causal discovery and then uses this information to guide the training via a causal invariance loss with synthetic perturbations appears innovative. It offers a fresh perspective on automating the end-to-end process of identifying and mitigating spurious correlations, moving beyond manual specification or simpler invariance constraints."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Score-based causal discovery can be computationally intensive and may struggle with high-dimensional data like medical images or genomics without dimensionality reduction or assumptions. Generating high-fidelity, semantically meaningful counterfactual perturbations for complex data using generative models is also non-trivial and requires careful validation. Integrating these components into a robust pipeline requires considerable effort. While conceptually sound, practical implementation at scale might require substantial research and engineering, making it moderately feasible within a typical research project timeframe."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. It tackles the critical and pervasive problem of spurious correlations, which severely limits the reliability, fairness, and generalization of ML models, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare (explicitly mentioned). Developing automated methods for discovery and mitigation, as proposed, would be a major advancement over manual approaches. Success could lead to more robust and trustworthy AI systems, directly addressing the core concerns of the workshop and having substantial practical impact."
