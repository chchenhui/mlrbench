        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls out the issue of polygenic risk scores failing across ancestries due to spurious correlations (Example 3). The proposed research directly tackles this specific problem using methods related to invariance (IRM) and robustness, which are central themes of the workshop. It aims to learn robust models in the presence of spurious correlations, explores relationships between causal ML (invariance) and algorithmic fairness (reducing disparities), and addresses a real-world failure mode, all of which are solicited topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (PRS bias), the core method (IRM with populations as environments), the use of auxiliary information (population structure metadata, adversarial regularization), and the intended outcomes (improved cross-ancestry PRS accuracy, robust variant identification) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The link between the method and the goal is immediately understandable. Minor implementation details could be further specified, but the overall research direction is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While IRM is an existing technique and the problem of PRS bias is known, the specific application of IRM to learn ancestry-invariant PRS by treating populations as environments represents a novel approach in this domain. Combining IRM with population structure data and adversarial regularization specifically for this task adds further innovation. It offers a fresh perspective grounded in causal invariance principles to address a persistent challenge where other methods have had limited success."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Large-scale genetic datasets with ancestry information (or proxies like genetic principal components) are increasingly available (e.g., UK Biobank, All of Us). IRM, while sometimes challenging to optimize, is an established algorithm implementable with standard machine learning frameworks. Defining environments based on ancestry groups or genetic PCs is a common practice. The main challenges involve the computational scale of genomic data and ensuring effective convergence of the IRM optimization to find truly invariant signals, but these are engineering/optimization challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the lack of portability of PRS across diverse ancestries is a critical challenge in genomics and precision medicine, directly contributing to health disparities. Successfully developing ancestry-invariant PRS would represent a major advancement towards equitable healthcare, improving risk prediction for underrepresented populations. Identifying robust, ancestry-invariant genetic markers could also yield fundamental biological insights. The problem's importance is underscored by its inclusion as a key example in the workshop's call for papers."
