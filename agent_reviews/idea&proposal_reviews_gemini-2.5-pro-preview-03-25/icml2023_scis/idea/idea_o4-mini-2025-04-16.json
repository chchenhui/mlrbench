        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses several solicited topics, including 'Methods for discovering and diagnosing spurious correlations', 'Evaluation and stress tests of model stability', and 'Learning robust models in the presence of spurious correlations' through the proposed invariance regularization. The motivation explicitly mentions examples (X-rays, NLP) similar to those highlighted in the call, and the goal of creating an open-source tool for practitioners aligns with the workshop's emphasis on real-world impact and collaboration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main steps (perturbation graph learning, counterfactual generation, drift measurement, retraining), validation plan, and expected outcomes are clearly laid out. The core concept of an 'adaptive' tester guided by model instability is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details of the 'structured perturbation graph' using generative models and the exact nature of the adaptive search algorithm, but the overall proposal is well-defined and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like counterfactual generation, generative models for perturbations, and invariance regularization exist, the proposed combination and approach are innovative. Specifically, the concept of learning a 'structured perturbation graph' to systematically guide counterfactual generation, coupled with an 'adaptive' strategy that prioritizes perturbations maximizing model instability for discovering spurious correlations, represents a fresh perspective compared to random testing or standard feature attribution methods. The integration of discovery and mitigation is also a strong point."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Leveraging generative models for structured perturbations is achievable with current technology, although potentially complex depending on the data modality. The core challenge lies in the 'adaptive' search for feature subsets maximizing instability, which could be computationally expensive and require sophisticated optimization or search heuristics. However, the validation plan uses standard datasets, and the individual components (generative models, counterfactuals, regularization) are established techniques. Overall, it requires significant expertise and careful implementation but is within the realm of current ML research capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Spurious correlations are a critical barrier to reliable ML deployment, as emphasized by the workshop call. This proposal tackles the crucial need for automated, systematic methods to *discover* these hidden dependencies before models fail in the wild. Providing a ranked list of spurious features offers actionable insights for model developers. The potential to improve model robustness through targeted regularization, demonstrated across important domains like medical imaging and NLP, underscores its high impact potential. An open-source tool would be a valuable contribution to the community."
