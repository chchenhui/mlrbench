        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's theme. It directly addresses the core problem of models exploiting spurious correlations and failing OOD, as highlighted in the call. The proposed method aims at 'Learning robust models in the presence of spurious correlations', which is explicitly listed as a solicited topic. It also touches upon invariance and stability, central themes of the workshop. The motivation aligns perfectly with the examples given (X-rays, NLP). The goal of achieving robustness without group labels also addresses a practical limitation relevant to real-world applications emphasized by the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with a well-defined motivation and a structured approach (identify, generate, retrain). The core components (attribution methods, conditional generative models, consistency loss) are specified, making the overall concept understandable. The goal of achieving invariance to spurious features without group labels is explicit. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanism for ensuring the generative model *only* modifies spurious features while perfectly preserving the label and realism, and how reliably attribution methods can pinpoint *all* relevant spurious features, but the overall research direction is well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining existing techniques in a new way to tackle spurious correlations without group labels. While using attribution methods, generative models for augmentation, and consistency losses are known concepts, their specific integration here – using attribution to guide conditional counterfactual generation specifically targeting *unknown* spurious features for robustness – offers a fresh perspective. It differs from standard data augmentation, adversarial training, or methods requiring predefined groups or attributes. The novelty lies in the targeted, attribution-guided counterfactual generation pipeline for this specific problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is satisfactory but presents significant challenges. Identifying spurious features reliably and comprehensively using influence functions or attribution methods can be difficult; these methods can be noisy or computationally expensive. The core challenge lies in training a conditional generative model to modify *only* these identified (potentially complex and subtle) spurious features while preserving the true label and ensuring the generated examples are realistic and diverse enough. This requires sophisticated generative models and careful control/conditioning, which is technically demanding and may require substantial compute resources and data. The retraining step itself is feasible, but the overall success hinges heavily on the success of the identification and generation steps."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it addresses a critical and pervasive problem in machine learning – the lack of robustness due to spurious correlations, which directly limits real-world deployment. Developing methods that improve OOD generalization without relying on scarce group labels would be a major advancement. Success in this research could lead to more reliable models in high-stakes domains like healthcare and NLP, aligning perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on foundational research with real-world impact. It tackles a core challenge highlighted by the workshop organizers."
