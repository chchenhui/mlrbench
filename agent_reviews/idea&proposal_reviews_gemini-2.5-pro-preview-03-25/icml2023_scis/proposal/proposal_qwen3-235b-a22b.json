    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of spurious correlations, invariance, stability, and learning robust models without group annotations. The proposed ACA method directly implements the research idea by combining attribution, counterfactual generation, and consistency loss. It positions itself well within the recent literature, citing relevant concepts and challenges (like identification, generation, invariance enforcement without group labels) and proposing solutions that build upon or offer alternatives to existing methods mentioned in the review (e.g., SPUME, EVaLS)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context effectively, research objectives are explicitly listed, and the significance is well-articulated. The methodology section breaks down the ACA framework into logical steps (identification, generation, retraining) with clear technical descriptions, including relevant equations (IG, GAN loss, consistency loss). The experimental design is detailed, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation plans. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving minimal room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining existing techniques in a novel pipeline. While attribution methods, conditional GANs (CycleGAN), and consistency regularization are individually established, their integration—specifically using attribution maps to guide a conditional GAN for targeted counterfactual generation aimed at mitigating spurious correlations without group labels—represents a fresh approach. It differs from methods in the literature review like meta-learning (SPUME), subnetwork extraction, or loss-based resampling (EVaLS). The novelty lies in this specific synergistic combination and application rather than inventing a fundamentally new component."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, based on established ML concepts (gradient attribution, GANs, consistency loss). The pipeline is logically coherent. However, its success hinges on key assumptions: 1) Integrated Gradients can reliably identify the relevant spurious features, which is a known challenge for attribution methods. 2) The conditional CycleGAN can effectively manipulate *only* these features based on the attribution mask while preserving the true label and avoiding artifacts, which is technically challenging. While the technical formulations presented are standard, the practical realization of targeted, clean counterfactual generation requires careful implementation and validation. The methodology is mostly well-defined, but these assumptions introduce moderate risks to the soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and resources. Calculating attributions, training CycleGANs, and implementing consistency loss are standard practices in deep learning. The proposal acknowledges the need for significant computational resources (A100 GPUs) and hyperparameter optimization. The chosen datasets are standard benchmarks. The main challenge is algorithmic: successfully training the conditional GAN for precise, targeted manipulation based on attribution maps. While challenging, it doesn't seem insurmountable with appropriate expertise and effort, making the overall plan realistic and implementable, albeit with moderate technical risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: the lack of robustness due to spurious correlations, particularly when group labels are unavailable. This is a major barrier to deploying ML models reliably in high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous systems, as highlighted by the workshop call. If successful, the proposed ACA framework would offer a practical tool for improving OOD generalization and fairness, potentially leading to major advancements. It directly contributes to the workshop's goals by exploring connections between causality (counterfactuals), robustness, and practical ML, with clear potential for scientific and societal impact."
