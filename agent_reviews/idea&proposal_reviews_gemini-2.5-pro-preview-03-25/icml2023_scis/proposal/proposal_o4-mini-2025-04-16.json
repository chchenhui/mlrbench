        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of spurious correlations and the need for robust models, as highlighted in the task description. The proposed ACA framework directly implements the research idea, focusing on annotation-free feature identification, counterfactual generation, and consistency training. It explicitly tackles key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the difficulty of identifying spurious features without labels and enforcing invariance. The methodology, chosen datasets (Waterbirds, CelebA, MNLI, PRS mirroring task examples), and evaluation plan are all highly relevant and consistent with the overall context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to methodology and expected impact. The core ACA framework, including feature identification, counterfactual generation, and retraining, is explained well. Mathematical formulations are provided for key components. Objectives are explicitly listed. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as the precise mechanism for combining masks or more details on the generator conditioning, but the overall proposal is easily understandable and unambiguous regarding its main goals and approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While individual components like gradient attribution, influence functions, generative models (CycleGAN/Diffusion), and consistency loss are known, their specific combination within the ACA framework for *annotation-free* spurious correlation mitigation is novel. It differs from recent methods cited in the literature review (e.g., subnetwork extraction, self-guided learning, loss-based rebalancing) by focusing on *generative counterfactuals guided by automated feature identification*. The novelty lies in this synthesis and targeted application rather than a single groundbreaking technique."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (attribution methods, generative modeling, consistency regularization). The proposed methodology is logical, linking feature identification to targeted counterfactual generation and invariance training. The technical formulations are generally correct. However, the soundness relies heavily on two critical assumptions: (1) the accuracy and reliability of the gradient/influence-based spurious feature identification, which can be noisy, and (2) the ability of the conditional generative model to modify *only* the identified spurious features while preserving causal ones, which is technically challenging. The planned theoretical analysis starts appropriately with a linear model but acknowledges the need for extension."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. It leverages existing techniques and standard benchmark datasets. However, training sophisticated conditional generative models (especially diffusion models) requires significant computational resources and expertise. Ensuring the generator's fidelity (modifying only spurious features) is a non-trivial technical hurdle. Tuning the feature identification methods and balancing the various loss terms will also require careful experimentation. While challenging, it is achievable within a well-equipped research setting."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and pervasive problem in machine learning â€“ the lack of robustness due to spurious correlations, particularly when group labels are unavailable. Developing effective, annotation-free methods like ACA could lead to major advancements in building reliable and fair models for high-stakes applications (healthcare, NLP, genomics, as mentioned). Success would provide a valuable tool for the community and potentially set new benchmarks for OOD generalization and worst-group robustness."
