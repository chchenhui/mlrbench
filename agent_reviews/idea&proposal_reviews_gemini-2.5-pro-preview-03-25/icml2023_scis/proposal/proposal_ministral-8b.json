        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of spurious correlations and the need for robust models that generalize OOD, as emphasized in the workshop call. The proposed ACA framework implements the research idea faithfully, focusing on mitigating spurious correlations without requiring group labels â€“ a key challenge mentioned in the idea, task description, and literature review. The methodology incorporates elements discussed (attribution, counterfactuals, consistency loss) and targets relevant application domains (medical imaging, NLP) mentioned in the task description. It acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to methodology and expected impact. The research objectives are explicitly listed. The algorithmic steps (identification, generation, retraining) are well-defined at a high level. However, some technical details could be slightly clearer: the specific criteria for using influence functions/gradients to identify *spurious* (vs. merely important) features are not fully elaborated, and the conditioning mechanism for the generative models is described generally. Despite these minor points needing refinement, the overall proposal is easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the components (attribution methods, generative models like CycleGAN/Diffusion, consistency loss) are existing techniques, their specific combination into the ACA framework for tackling spurious correlations *without* group labels by identifying features, generating targeted counterfactuals, and enforcing consistency appears novel. The literature review highlights other recent approaches (meta-learning, subnetwork extraction, group inference), and ACA presents a distinct alternative methodology. It's not entirely groundbreaking but offers a fresh perspective on combining existing tools for this specific challenge."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has potential weaknesses. The use of standard influence functions or gradient attribution to specifically identify *spurious* features is questionable; these methods identify influential features for the *model's current prediction*, which may or may not be spurious. The proposal doesn't detail how it will differentiate between causally relevant important features and spurious ones using these methods alone. This identification step is critical and needs stronger justification or a more refined technique. Furthermore, generating counterfactuals that modify *only* the identified spurious features while perfectly preserving the label is technically challenging and may introduce artifacts. The rest of the methodology (generative models, consistency loss) relies on established techniques, but the soundness of the overall approach hinges significantly on the success and validity of the identification and generation steps."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents implementation challenges. Accessing suitable datasets is generally possible. Implementing attribution methods and retraining models is standard. However, training conditional generative models (CycleGANs, Diffusion Models) effectively, especially for complex data like medical images, requires significant computational resources and expertise. Ensuring these models generate high-quality, targeted counterfactuals is non-trivial. While technically achievable within a well-resourced research environment, the successful implementation, particularly of the counterfactual generation step, requires careful engineering and validation, posing moderate risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Addressing spurious correlations to improve model robustness and OOD generalization is a critical challenge in machine learning, directly relevant to the workshop's theme. The focus on methods that do *not* require group annotations significantly increases the practical applicability, as such labels are often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Success in this research could lead to more reliable, fair, and trustworthy ML models deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare and NLP, representing a substantial contribution to the field."
