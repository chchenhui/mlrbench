        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses 'Data Problems x Foundation Models' and 'Data Perspective to Efficiency' by proposing a data selection method (a form of data curation) to improve the efficiency of continually updating Foundation Models. It tackles a core challenge in managing data for large, evolving models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (cost and forgetting in FM continual learning), the core mechanism (influence-guided data selection), and the goal (efficiency, reduced forgetting) are clearly stated. Minor ambiguity exists around the specifics of the 'efficient method to approximate' influence scores, but the overall research direction is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While influence functions and continual learning are existing concepts, applying influence functions (or approximations) to guide data selection specifically for *efficient continual learning* in *Foundation Models* is a novel approach. Addressing both learning promotion and forgetting mitigation via influence scores in this context offers a fresh perspective compared to standard continual learning techniques or naive data sampling."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Calculating exact influence functions for FMs is computationally prohibitive. The feasibility heavily relies on developing an 'efficient' and sufficiently accurate approximation method, which is a non-trivial research problem itself. Furthermore, experimenting with continual updates on FMs requires substantial computational resources, even when using data subsets. The practical implementation faces considerable technical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and potentially impactful. Efficiently and effectively updating large Foundation Models with new data while mitigating catastrophic forgetting is a critical bottleneck in their deployment and maintenance. A successful outcome would offer substantial benefits in terms of computational cost reduction and model adaptability, enabling FMs to stay current in dynamic environments more practically."
