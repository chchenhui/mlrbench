        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple interested areas, including 'Data Problems x Foundation Models', 'Data Quality, Dataset Curation', 'Data Perspective to Efficiency... and Alignment', and 'Data Perspective on Safety and Ethics'. The core proposal focuses on curating data for FMs to improve both alignment and efficiency, which is central to the workshop's theme of understanding and addressing data problems in the context of foundation models."

        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, the dual objectives (alignment potential, efficiency contribution), the proposed method (MAB, proxy models), and expected outcomes are explained well. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of the proxy models and the exact metrics for efficiency contribution, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While data curation and active learning techniques (like MABs) exist, the specific formulation of a dual-objective optimization targeting *both* alignment and efficiency simultaneously within a dynamic curation framework for large-scale FM training is innovative. It offers a fresh perspective on data selection beyond generic quality metrics by explicitly linking it to downstream alignment and training efficiency goals."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Developing accurate and efficient proxy models to estimate alignment and efficiency at scale is non-trivial. Integrating a dynamic MAB system into massive FM training pipelines requires significant engineering effort. The computational overhead of the curation process itself needs careful management. While the components are conceptually sound, scaling and practical implementation pose considerable hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing data alignment and training efficiency simultaneously tackles two critical challenges in FM development. Success could lead to safer, more ethical, and significantly more cost-effective FMs. It has the potential to shift the paradigm of data curation from simple filtering to strategic optimization aligned with key model development goals, offering major advancements."
