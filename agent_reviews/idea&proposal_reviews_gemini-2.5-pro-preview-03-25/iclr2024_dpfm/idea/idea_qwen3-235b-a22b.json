        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Data Problems for Foundation Models', specifically focusing on 'Data Quality' and 'Dataset Curation'. It explicitly connects data curation to key areas mentioned in the task, such as 'Efficiency' (fewer training resources), 'Safety and Ethics' (toxicity, bias), and implicitly 'Alignment' (reduced hallucination, higher coherence). The proposal fits squarely within the workshop's interested areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation, the core concept of a self-supervised Data Quality Scorer (DQS) using FM metadata, the proposed methodology (contrastive learning, iterative curation), and the evaluation plan are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It is immediately understandable what the research aims to achieve and how."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While automated data curation and using model signals for data selection exist, the specific approach of using self-supervision leveraging diverse internal FM metadata (attention, uncertainty, embeddings) via contrastive learning to train a dedicated, lightweight scorer explicitly for FM-specific quality, safety, and relevance metrics is innovative. It offers a fresh perspective compared to simpler filtering or reliance on external proxies."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Accessing FM metadata (embeddings, attention patterns, uncertainty estimates) is possible, and training models using contrastive learning is standard. However, applying this at the scale of typical FM datasets presents significant engineering and computational challenges (processing vast data, iterative retraining/scoring). While achievable, it requires substantial resources and optimization, making it good feasibility rather than excellent (straightforward)."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Data quality and curation are critical bottlenecks for improving the reliability, safety, and efficiency of Foundation Models. Manual curation is impractical at scale. An effective automated method like AutoCurate-FM could lead to major advancements by enabling more robust, ethical, and efficient FM development, addressing a core challenge in the field with broad potential benefits."
