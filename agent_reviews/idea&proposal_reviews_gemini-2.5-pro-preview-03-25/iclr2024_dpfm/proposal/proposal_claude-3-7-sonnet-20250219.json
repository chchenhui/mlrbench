        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description's focus on data problems (curation, quality, safety, alignment) for Foundation Models. It directly implements and significantly expands upon the research idea (RL-guided data curation for safety). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and positions itself within the provided literature review, citing relevant works (Maini et al., Shi et al.) and explicitly addressing the key challenges identified, such as scalability of curation and balancing safety/performance. The proposed RL-DDC framework directly tackles the core themes of data-centric AI for safety alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context effectively, the objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the RL-DDC framework components (data pool, reward model, RL agent, training/evaluation pipeline). The RL formulation (MDP, PPO), reward function structure, and iterative training process are explained with high clarity. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly articulated. While Figure 1 is mentioned but not included, the textual description is sufficient for understanding. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While RL and data curation are known concepts, applying RL to *dynamically* and *iteratively* select/weight training data specifically for safety/alignment *during* the model training loop is innovative. This contrasts with static pre-filtering (Maini et al.), post-hoc fine-tuning data generation (Shi et al.), simple reward-based ranking (Dong et al.), or inference-time adaptation (Zhang et al.). The concept of a learned policy adapting the data curriculum based on evolving model state and safety metrics represents a fresh approach to data-centric alignment."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, based on established principles of RL (MDPs, PPO) and data-centric AI. The methodology is well-reasoned, outlining a plausible iterative framework. The use of a composite reward function is appropriate, although its practical design and calibration (balancing safety, alignment, diversity using classifiers, proxies, human labels) represent a significant challenge and potential weakness. The MDP formulation is conceptually correct, but defining the state space effectively could be complex. The technical formulations (PPO objective) are standard. The main soundness concern lies in the complexity and potential fragility of the reward signal engineering required for success."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While it relies on existing technologies (RL libraries, classifiers, FMs), the iterative loop involving RL agent training, data selection, FM training/fine-tuning, and evaluation is computationally intensive and potentially very time-consuming, even with the proposed smaller initial model. Designing and robustly calibrating the multi-component reward model is non-trivial and critical to success. Managing the large data pool and ensuring stable RL training add further complexity. Significant computational resources and careful engineering are required, making scalability to very large FMs a major question mark."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem in contemporary AI: ensuring the safety and alignment of powerful foundation models. The reliance on massive, often uncurated datasets is a major bottleneck for responsible AI development. An effective, scalable, automated method for data curation like RL-DDC could have a major impact, potentially leading to inherently safer models, reducing reliance on costly manual annotation or post-hoc fixes, and contributing valuable methodology to the field of data-centric AI and AI alignment. The potential to make alignment more adaptive and economically viable is substantial."
