        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses one of the primary focus areas listed in the task description: 'Autoformalization and the reversed auto-informalization', specifically the goal to 'develop methods that improve the precision of the autoformalization process from natural language proof to formal proof'. The motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes are perfectly aligned with this core topic of the AI for Math workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is generally well-articulated, outlining the motivation, a multi-step methodology, expected outcomes, and impact. The overall goal is clear. However, the term 'multi-modal learning' is used somewhat unconventionally here, seemingly referring to the integration of NLP (neural) and symbolic reasoning paradigms rather than distinct data modalities. The specifics of the 'symbolic reasoning module' (how it interprets structured NL, generates intermediate expressions) and how it integrates with the neural network component lack detail, leaving some ambiguity about the precise technical approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The core problem of autoformalization and the use of neural networks are established research areas. Neurosymbolic approaches, combining neural learning with symbolic reasoning, are also increasingly explored. The novelty lies primarily in the specific application and proposed integration of a symbolic module explicitly for generating intermediate mathematical expressions to enhance precision within an autoformalization pipeline. While it combines existing concepts (NLP, NNs, symbolic reasoning, active learning, back-translation), the particular configuration aimed at improving autoformalization precision offers moderate originality. It's more of an incremental innovation than a groundbreaking concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is conceptually feasible but faces practical challenges. Data collection (large-scale parallel NL/formal proofs) is a significant bottleneck in this field. Developing a robust symbolic reasoning module that accurately interprets nuanced natural language and integrates effectively with a neural network is technically complex and non-trivial. Training the required neural networks is computationally intensive but standard. While the individual components exist, successfully integrating them and overcoming the data scarcity issue requires considerable effort and resources, making the overall feasibility satisfactory but challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a critical challenge in AI for Math – the reliable translation of human mathematical reasoning into formal systems. Improving autoformalization precision would be highly impactful, enabling more trustworthy AI assistance in mathematical discovery, automated theorem proving (ATP), formal verification, and potentially generating provably correct code – all areas mentioned as important in the task description. Success would represent a significant advancement in bridging the gap between informal human mathematics and formal machine reasoning."
