        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Autoformalization and the reversed auto-informalization' and improving precision, which is the core focus of this idea ('Dual-Process Autoformalization'). It directly addresses the dual nature of the problem and aims for higher precision. Furthermore, it connects to other relevant workshop topics like formal verification, theorem proving (as impact areas), neurosymbolic reasoning (via the hybrid approach), and measurement (by proposing specific metrics like 'graph alignment score'). The idea strongly resonates with the workshop's goal of fostering human-AI collaboration in mathematics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (precision in autoformalization), the main technical approach (hybrid neural-symbolic model with dependency graphs, joint optimization of dual processes), the proposed methodology (LLMs, symbolic graphs, constraint satisfaction, RL training, specific metrics), and the expected outcomes/impact. The concept of using dependency graphs for refinement and ensuring bidirectional coherence is well-articulated. While specific implementation details are naturally omitted at the idea stage, the overall research direction and components are explained with excellent clarity and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using neural networks (LLMs) for autoformalization and employing symbolic methods are existing research directions, this proposal's novelty lies in the specific combination: 1) A hybrid neural-symbolic architecture explicitly using dependency graphs for logical structure modeling and refinement via constraint satisfaction. 2) Jointly optimizing both autoformalization and reverse informalization within a single framework. 3) Employing reinforcement learning guided by graph consistency and human evaluation for this dual task. This synthesis of techniques applied to the dual formalization/informalization problem offers a fresh and promising perspective compared to methods focusing solely on one direction or using less integrated hybrid approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Fine-tuning large language models and developing symbolic reasoning components are individually achievable. However, effectively integrating them into a cohesive hybrid system that uses dependency graphs for constraint satisfaction poses considerable technical hurdles. Acquiring or generating large-scale, high-quality aligned corpora of natural language proofs and corresponding formal proofs with dependency graph annotations could be a bottleneck. Training such a complex system, potentially involving reinforcement learning with human feedback and novel metrics like 'graph alignment score', requires substantial engineering effort, computational resources, and expertise in both ML and formal methods. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation is challenging but not impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Autoformalization is a critical bottleneck limiting the synergy between human mathematical intuition and machine-checked formal reasoning. Successfully improving the precision of autoformalization (aiming for a 50% reduction in manual correction) and generating clearer informalizations would be a major advancement. This could significantly accelerate mathematical discovery, improve the reliability of formal verification processes (impacting software and hardware correctness), enhance AI-assisted education in mathematics, and facilitate more effective human-AI collaboration in complex reasoning tasks, directly aligning with the high-level goals mentioned in the task description."
