        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Automated theorem proving' bullet point by proposing a method to relieve the search space problem ('How do we relieve or solve the intermediate step errors in proving?' can be interpreted broadly to include inefficient search). Furthermore, it explicitly uses a 'neurosymbolic reasoning' approach, which is listed as a related topic of interest for the workshop. The goal of bridging human-like intuition (via sketches) and formal deduction fits the workshop's theme of AI for mathematical reasoning and collaboration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (ATP search space), the core proposal (ML model predicts proof sketch), the components (GNN/Transformer, symbolic prover like Lean/Coq), and the mechanism (sketch guides prover) are all explained concisely and without significant ambiguity. The concept of a 'proof sketch' (represented as sequences or dependency graphs) is also reasonably defined for a research idea abstract. Minor details about the exact sketch representation or integration mechanism would require further specification, but the overall idea is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using machine learning to guide ATPs is an active area (e.g., tactic prediction), the specific focus on generating a high-level 'proof sketch' as a structured plan (sequence of lemmas/definitions or dependency graph) is innovative. It moves beyond local step prediction towards generating strategic guidance. This neuro-symbolic approach combining high-level neural planning with low-level symbolic verification offers a fresh perspective on tackling complex proofs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The core components (GNNs/Transformers, ATP systems) exist. However, the main hurdle is the dataset: creating or curating a large-scale dataset pairing theorems with corresponding high-level proof sketches is non-trivial, as 'proof sketches' are not standard artifacts and may require significant expert effort or sophisticated extraction techniques. Defining a suitable, consistent representation for these sketches and effectively integrating the sketch-based guidance into the ATP's search strategy are also considerable technical challenges. While plausible, it requires substantial effort and potentially new techniques for data generation and integration."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Automated Theorem Proving faces a major bottleneck in navigating vast search spaces for complex proofs. Successfully generating useful proof sketches could drastically improve the efficiency and capability of ATP systems, potentially enabling the verification of theorems currently out of reach. This would be a meaningful contribution to the fields of automated reasoning, formal verification, and potentially mathematics itself, aligning well with the workshop's goal of advancing AI for math."
