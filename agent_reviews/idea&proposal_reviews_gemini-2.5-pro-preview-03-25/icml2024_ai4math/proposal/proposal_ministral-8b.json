    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Automated theorem generation' challenge highlighted in the task description, proposing a method to generate 'new and practically valid theorems'. The methodology precisely follows the research idea, detailing the neural-symbolic framework, RL enhancement, ATP validation, and knowledge graph integration. Furthermore, it is well-situated within the provided literature, referencing relevant concepts like RL for proving/reasoning, neural-symbolic methods, and transformer-based generation, while explicitly aiming to tackle key challenges identified in the review (validity, novelty, evaluation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure with distinct sections for introduction, objectives, methodology, and impact. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The core components (Neural Network, ATP, RL Agent) and their intended interactions are explained. The algorithmic steps provide a high-level overview of the process. Evaluation metrics are listed. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the specific nature of the 'self-supervised learning approach' for the neural network, the precise mechanism for how the knowledge graph 'steers novelty', and the exact formulation of the RL reward function beyond ATP validation. However, these details are often elaborated during the research process, and the overall proposal is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like using transformers for generation, ATPs for validation, RL for optimization in theorem proving, and knowledge graphs exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the specific combination proposed here for *theorem generation* is innovative. Specifically, integrating RL guided by ATP rewards *and* simultaneously using a knowledge graph to steer towards novelty within the generation process appears to be a fresh approach compared to prior work focusing mainly on proving or conjecture generation without this combined validation/novelty guidance loop. It synthesizes existing ideas in a new configuration to tackle the specific challenge of generating novel *and* valid theorems."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established methodologies (Transformers, ATPs, RL, KGs, formal math corpora). The overall approach of using an ATP as a validator within an RL loop to guide a generator is conceptually robust. The planned evaluation metrics and experimental design (including baselines and human evaluation) are appropriate. However, the soundness score is slightly tempered because crucial details impacting rigor are underspecified. For instance, the design of the RL reward function (potential sparsity issues with only ATP validation), the state/action space representation, the method for measuring originality via KG distance, and the specifics of the self-supervised training lack detail. Addressing the known challenge of RL scalability in large search spaces is mentioned as a challenge in the literature review but not explicitly addressed with a proposed solution in the methodology."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires substantial expertise across multiple domains (NLP, formal methods, RL, KGs) and considerable computational resources. Integrating the neural generator, ATP, and RL agent efficiently is complex. Key technical hurdles include designing an effective and non-sparse reward function for the RL agent, managing the potentially vast search space for theorem generation (scalability), ensuring the ATP provides timely and useful feedback, and constructing/utilizing the knowledge graph effectively. While the components exist, their successful integration and optimization for this specific task carry notable risks and uncertainties, requiring significant research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in AI for mathematics: the automated generation of novel and formally valid theorems. Success in this area would represent a major advancement, potentially accelerating mathematical discovery, enabling new forms of human-AI collaboration in research, and pushing the boundaries of automated reasoning. The problem is central to the goals outlined in the task description and represents a grand challenge in the field. The potential impact on both theoretical mathematics and AI research (particularly in neural-symbolic systems and RL applications) is substantial."
