    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Automated theorem generation' challenge highlighted in the task description, aiming to generate 'new and practically valid theorems'. It faithfully expands on the core concepts outlined in the research idea (neural-symbolic, RL, ATP validation, KG for novelty). Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, referencing relevant concepts like RL for theorem proving/synthesis, neural generation, neural-symbolic methods, and KGs, while explicitly aiming to tackle the key challenges identified (validity, novelty vs. correctness, integration, RL scalability, evaluation)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes). Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology is broken down into understandable components (Generator, Verifier, RL, KG, Evaluation), each described with sufficient detail, including relevant formalisms where appropriate (e.g., MLM loss, RL reward structure, GAT). The experimental design and evaluation metrics are clearly outlined. While some implementation details require further specification (e.g., precise KG construction, complexity function f), the overall research plan, rationale, and expected contributions are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components draw from existing research highlighted in the literature review (e.g., transformers for generation, RL for proving, ATPs for verification, KGs), the specific *integration* of these elements into a cohesive framework aimed at *generating novel theorems* by using RL to explicitly optimize a multi-objective reward (validity, novelty, relevance) guided by a knowledge graph appears novel. It moves beyond using RL solely for proof search (like Lit 1, 2, 3, 4) or basic generation (Lit 6, 10) by incorporating symbolic verification directly into the RL loop and using a KG specifically to steer towards novelty. The comprehensive evaluation framework also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (Transformers, ATPs, RL, KGs) and established methods referenced implicitly or explicitly through the literature review. The methodology is generally well-defined, employing standard techniques like policy gradient RL, GATs for KG integration, and formal verification tools. The staged verification approach is a sensible way to manage computational costs. The inclusion of baselines and ablation studies in the experimental design demonstrates methodological rigor. While some technical formulations are high-level (expected in a proposal), the core technical approach is robust and well-justified. The acknowledgment of challenges like sparse rewards and proposed mitigations (curriculum learning) further strengthens its soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. It requires substantial computational resources (large model training, ATP execution, RL), access to specialized datasets (formal math corpora), and considerable expertise across ML, RL, and formal methods. Key challenges include the computational bottleneck of ATP verification within the RL loop (though staged verification helps), potential difficulties in constructing and effectively utilizing the knowledge graph, and the inherent difficulty of RL training with sparse rewards (though mitigations are proposed). The plan is ambitious but realistic given the current state of AI research and available tools. The proposal acknowledges limitations, suggesting the authors understand the practical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem at the intersection of AI and mathematics â€“ automated mathematical discovery. Generating novel, valid theorems could fundamentally change how mathematical research is conducted, potentially accelerating progress and uncovering new insights (as highlighted in the task description's goals). Success would represent a major advancement in AI's reasoning capabilities, particularly in neural-symbolic integration and creative generation within formal systems. The potential impact extends beyond pure mathematics to formal verification, scientific discovery, and education, making the research highly significant."
