    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Automated theorem generation' challenge highlighted in the task description, proposing a method to generate 'new and practically valid theorems'. It faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the neural-symbolic framework, RL integration, and evaluation strategy. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and positions itself relative to the cited literature, acknowledging prior work in theorem proving (TRAIL, TacticZero, QEDCartographer) and generation (Johnson & Lee, Green & White, Blue & Red), and explicitly aims to tackle the key challenges identified (validity, creativity/correctness balance, neurosymbolic integration, RL scalability, evaluation metrics)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Framework/RL, Experiments, Outcomes). The objectives, core components (transformer, symbolic layer, RL loop, ATP feedback, knowledge graph), and evaluation plan are well-defined. The rationale for combining different techniques is explained. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for integrating the knowledge graph into the RL state/action space or the exact implementation details of the symbolic constraint layer, but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like transformers for generation, RL for proving, ATPs, symbolic constraints, and knowledge graphs exist in the literature cited, their specific integration for *automated theorem generation* with ATP validation as an RL reward signal, guided by a knowledge graph for novelty, represents a fresh approach. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work focused primarily on theorem proving or less rigorously validated generation. The emphasis on generating formally verified, novel theorems using this specific combination of techniques constitutes a significant innovative step."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in deep learning (transformers), reinforcement learning (MDPs, PPO), and formal methods (ATPs, type theory). The proposed methodology, including data sources (Lean, Coq), the hybrid architecture, the RL formulation with a multi-component reward function, and the experimental design with baselines and ablation studies, is well-justified and technically coherent. It acknowledges potential issues like reward sparsity (addressed via curriculum learning). The technical formulation of the reward function adds rigor. Minor uncertainties remain regarding the practical efficiency of ATP calls in the RL loop and the perfect alignment of embedding similarity with true mathematical novelty, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the required technologies (transformers, RL libraries, ATPs like Lean/Coq) exist, integrating them into an efficient RL loop is complex. ATP verification can be computationally very expensive, potentially making the RL training process extremely slow or resource-intensive. Reward sparsity, even with curriculum learning, remains a major risk in theorem generation. Scaling the RL agent to navigate the vast search space of potential theorems is non-trivial. Success depends heavily on careful engineering, substantial computational resources, and potentially further algorithmic refinements to manage the complexity and cost. The plan is realistic in concept but ambitious in execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and challenging problem in AI for mathematics: the automated generation of novel, formally verified theorems. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially transforming how mathematical conjectures are discovered and explored. The potential impacts span accelerating mathematical research, enhancing formal verification processes, creating new educational tools, and aiding scientific discovery in fields relying on mathematical modeling. The goal of producing 'never-before-seen theorems' that are correct and potentially useful positions this research at the forefront of AI-driven scientific discovery."
