    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Automated theorem generation' challenge highlighted in the task description, proposing a method for generating 'new and practically valid theorems'. The methodology aligns perfectly with the research idea, detailing the hybrid neural-symbolic framework with RL and ATPs. It effectively incorporates and builds upon the cited literature (e.g., RL for proving, transformers for generation, neural-symbolic methods, KGs), positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape and addressing the key challenges identified (validity, novelty-correctness trade-off, integration)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The system architecture (Generator, RL Agent, KG) is clearly presented, and the algorithmic steps are broken down logically with supporting mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including baselines, datasets, and metrics, is specific and understandable. There are no significant ambiguities, making the proposal easy to follow and comprehend."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced techniques (transformer generation, RL fine-tuning, ATP validation, symbolic constraints, knowledge graph guidance) into a unified framework specifically for *theorem generation*. While individual components exist in the literature (RL for proving, transformers for conjecture generation, KGs for proving context), their synergistic combination aimed at optimizing for validity, novelty, and utility simultaneously within a generation loop is innovative. The specific design of the reward function incorporating ATP feedback, KG-based novelty, and utility is a distinct contribution compared to prior work focused primarily on proving or unconstrained generation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (Transformers, RL/PPO, ATPs, KGs) and established methods cited in the literature review. The proposed methodology, using an ATP for reward signal generation and PPO for optimization, is well-justified for ensuring validity while learning. The inclusion of symbolic constraints adds further rigor. The mathematical formulations are appropriate, although the definition of 'Utility' and the use of BLEU for semantic similarity could be refined for greater robustness. The planned experimental design, including baselines and ablation studies, demonstrates methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Required technologies (Transformers, RL frameworks, ATPs like Lean4) exist, and access to formal math corpora is possible. However, integrating these components effectively, especially the potentially slow ATP validation into the RL loop, requires careful engineering. Training the RL agent might be computationally expensive and require substantial tuning, particularly balancing the multi-objective reward function. Constructing a high-quality knowledge graph and defining robust metrics for novelty and utility are non-trivial tasks. While ambitious, the project is achievable for a well-equipped research team, albeit with considerable effort and potential roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem at the intersection of AI and mathematics: generating novel, valid theorems. Success would represent a major advancement in automated mathematical discovery, potentially accelerating research by providing mathematicians with reliable AI collaborators for hypothesis generation. The work directly contributes to the key theme of the task description (AI for Math, human-AI collaboration) and has broader implications for neural-symbolic reasoning, formal verification, and AI creativity. The expected outcomes (a working system, KG, benchmark) would be valuable contributions to the field."
