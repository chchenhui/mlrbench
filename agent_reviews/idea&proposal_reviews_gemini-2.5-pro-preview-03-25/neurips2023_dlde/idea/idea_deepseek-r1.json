        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task focuses on the symbiosis of Deep Learning (DL) and Differential Equations (DEs), specifically inviting submissions on using DL to solve challenging DE models (like high-dimensional PDEs) and incorporating DE concepts (like diffusion processes) into DL models. This proposal directly addresses both aspects: it uses a DL architecture (based on diffusion models) to solve high-dimensional PDEs, and it leverages the mathematical framework of diffusion processes (related to SDEs/PDEs) to build the solver. It fits squarely within the listed topics, particularly 'DL methods for solving high-dimensional... DE models' and 'Incorporating DEs into existing DL models (diffusion models, ...)'."

        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (challenges of high-D PDEs, limitations of current methods) is well-explained. The core concept of framing the PDE solution as a denoising process guided by a diffusion model modified by PDE operators, trained with a hybrid loss, is understandable. The expected outcomes and potential impact are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise mechanism for incorporating PDE operators into the forward diffusion process and the exact formulation/balancing of the hybrid loss, but these are details expected to be elaborated in a full paper rather than an initial idea description. Overall, the concept is well-defined and comprehensible."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using neural networks for PDEs (PINNs, Neural Operators) and diffusion models for generative tasks are established fields, the proposed approach combines these in a novel way. Specifically, framing the direct solution of forward high-dimensional PDEs as a structured denoising process where the diffusion dynamics explicitly incorporate the PDE's differential operators, and training this via a hybrid score-matching and PDE residual loss, appears to be a fresh perspective. It moves beyond standard physics-informed constraints on generative models towards using the diffusion framework itself as the solver mechanism tailored by the PDE structure. This specific formulation offers a new direction compared to existing neural PDE solvers."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. Diffusion models are computationally intensive, especially in high dimensions. Integrating PDE operators directly into the diffusion process requires careful mathematical derivation and robust implementation. Training with a hybrid loss function (score-matching + PDE residual) necessitates careful tuning and balancing, and computing PDE residuals for high-dimensional inputs can be complex. Significant computational resources (GPU clusters) would be required for training and experimentation. However, the core components (neural networks, automatic differentiation, diffusion model frameworks) are available. The feasibility hinges on careful implementation and potentially significant computational effort, but it doesn't rely on non-existent technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Solving high-dimensional PDEs is a grand challenge problem that severely limits progress in many scientific and engineering domains (e.g., quantum mechanics, financial modeling, fluid dynamics, material science) due to the curse of dimensionality. Existing methods like PINNs and neural operators still face scalability and efficiency issues in very high dimensions (100+). If successful, a diffusion-based solver that effectively scales to such dimensions while maintaining accuracy could represent a major advancement, enabling simulations and analyses previously intractable. The potential impact on scientific discovery and industrial applications is substantial."
