        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: the intersection of ML, compression, and information theory; learned compression techniques; theoretical understanding (RD limits, IB principles); and compression without quantization. The methodology using normalizing flows and Information Bottleneck aligns perfectly with the research idea. It also positions itself effectively relative to the cited literature, aiming to improve upon existing flow-based and VQ-based compression methods by introducing a continuous, theoretically grounded approach."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The technical details, including the architecture, loss function, dequantization approach, and algorithmic steps, are presented with high clarity. The experimental design is thorough and easy to understand. There are no significant ambiguities, making the proposal immediately comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While normalizing flows and the Information Bottleneck principle have been explored separately or in different contexts (e.g., IB-INNs for classification, flows for lossless or basic lossy compression), their specific combination for lossy compression using continuous Gaussian dequantization noise as a relaxation, coupled with the derivation of theoretical RD bounds linked to the IB parameter and noise level, constitutes a novel approach. It offers a distinct alternative to dominant VQ-based methods and prior flow-based compression work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (normalizing flows, information theory, rate-distortion theory, Information Bottleneck). The proposed methodology, including the flow architecture, prior modeling, and RD Lagrangian optimization, is technically sound. The use of Gaussian dequantization noise is a reasonable technique for continuous relaxation. The claim of deriving theoretical RD bounds adds rigor, although the tightness and practical utility of these bounds remain to be proven. The experimental plan is comprehensive and follows standard practices."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current deep learning technology and frameworks. Implementing normalizing flows and training with an IB objective is achievable. However, training deep flow models, especially multi-scale ones for high-resolution data (images/videos), is computationally intensive and may require significant GPU resources and careful tuning for stability and convergence. Achieving the claimed latency reductions compared to optimized VQ methods might also pose challenges, as flow computations can be sequential. The experimental plan is extensive, requiring careful execution. Overall, it's feasible but demanding."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses critical limitations in current learned compression methods, namely the issues arising from discrete quantization (loss of differentiability, theoretical intractability). By proposing a fully differentiable, continuous approach with theoretical grounding via the Information Bottleneck, it has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in neural compression, offering potentially better RD performance, smoother rate control, and lower latency. The theoretical bounds could provide valuable insights into the fundamental limits of learned representations. Success could impact practical applications like streaming and on-device ML, and contribute to theoretical understanding."
