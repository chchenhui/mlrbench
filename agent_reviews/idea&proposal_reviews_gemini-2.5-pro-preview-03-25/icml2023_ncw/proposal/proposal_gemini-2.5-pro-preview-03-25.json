    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of improving learned compression, exploring theoretical limits (specifically compression without quantization), and integrating information-theoretic principles (Information Bottleneck). It faithfully elaborates on the core research idea of using continuous flows (FlowCodec) to bypass quantization issues. Furthermore, it effectively situates the proposed work within the provided literature, acknowledging relevant prior work like Helminger et al. [9] on NF-based compression and Ardizzone et al. [10] on IB-NFs, while clearly positioning its unique contribution (explicit IB formulation for end-to-end lossy compression)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The problem statement regarding quantization limitations is precise. The proposed FlowCodec solution, including the architecture (encoder/decoder with NFs), the continuous latent space, the IB-based objective function (D + beta*KL), and the role of beta, is explained lucidly. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides a detailed and logical plan for implementation, training, and evaluation. The mathematical formulations are presented clearly. The transition from the initial idea's 'dequantization noise' to the more general conditional flow formulation is handled well."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While normalizing flows have been explored for compression previously (e.g., Helminger et al. [9]), the core novelty lies in the explicit integration of the Information Bottleneck principle via the KL divergence term (KL(q(z|x) || p(z))) as the rate regularizer within a fully differentiable, end-to-end framework for *lossy* compression, specifically aiming to replace quantization. This contrasts with VQ methods and offers a different theoretical motivation than prior NF compression work. The connection drawn to IB theory [10] (though applied differently here) and the potential extension to continuous JSCC further enhance the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations: normalizing flows for density estimation and generation, the Information Bottleneck principle for representation learning, and rate-distortion theory (Lagrangian optimization). The proposed methodology, including the architecture choices (CNNs + NFs), the objective function, the training strategy (varying beta), and the evaluation plan (standard metrics, datasets, baselines, ablations), is well-established and appropriate. The technical formulations appear correct. The proposal realistically acknowledges potential challenges like NF training stability and the gap between the KL-divergence rate proxy and practical bitrates, suggesting mitigation or careful evaluation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required technologies (CNNs, NFs, deep learning frameworks) are mature and accessible. Standard datasets are proposed. The methodology outlines a clear, step-by-step research plan. The main challenges relate to the computational resources needed for training potentially deep conditional normalizing flows across multiple beta values, and potential difficulties in achieving numerical stability during training. However, these are common challenges in deep generative modeling research and do not render the proposal impractical. The plan includes standard techniques to address stability."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses fundamental limitations (non-differentiability, theoretical disconnect, information loss) of quantization, a core component in many state-of-the-art neural compression methods. By proposing a theoretically grounded (IB principle), fully differentiable alternative using continuous flows, it has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in neural compression, particularly regarding perceptual quality and fine detail preservation. Success would strengthen the link between information theory and practical compression systems, enable smoother rate control, and potentially open doors for new applications like robust JSCC or differentiable compression layers, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
