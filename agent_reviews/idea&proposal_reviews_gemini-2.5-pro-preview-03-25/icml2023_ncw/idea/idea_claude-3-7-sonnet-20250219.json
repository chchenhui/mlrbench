    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the workshop call: 'Accelerating training and inference for large foundation models', 'Improvements in learning-based techniques for compressing ... model weights', and 'integrating information-theoretic principles'. The focus on dynamic quantization for LLMs using a controller network fits perfectly within the intersection of machine learning, model compression, and information theory sought by the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (LLM inference cost), the core concept (adaptive precision dynamic inference), the proposed mechanism (lightweight precision controller using input/activations), and the goal (reduced computation with minimal performance loss) are clearly explained. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise architecture and training of the 'precision controller' and the specific 'information-theoretic principles' applied beyond minimizing mutual information loss, but the overall proposal is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While dynamic quantization and mixed-precision inference are existing concepts, the proposed approach of using a dedicated, lightweight controller network to dynamically assign precision to different *components* of an LLM based on *both input and intermediate activations* during inference, explicitly guided by information-theoretic principles, offers a novel mechanism. It combines existing ideas in a specific and potentially more fine-grained way than typical static or layer-wise quantization schemes."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is satisfactory but presents significant challenges. Implementing truly dynamic, fine-grained precision switching during inference can be complex and may face hardware limitations, as current accelerators are often optimized for fixed-precision operations. The overhead of the 'precision controller' network must be carefully managed to ensure it doesn't negate the computational savings. Training this controller effectively and ensuring stable inference across diverse inputs are also non-trivial engineering and research problems. Significant effort would be required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Reducing the computational cost of LLM inference by a large margin (claimed up to 70%) with minimal performance degradation (<1%) would be a major advancement. It addresses a critical bottleneck hindering the widespread deployment of large models, especially in resource-constrained environments like edge devices or real-time applications. Success in this area would have substantial practical impact."
