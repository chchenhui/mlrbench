    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses a core objective of the workshop: the development of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for spurious correlations. It specifically proposes a new benchmark for the medical field, utilizing generative models to create controlled datasets, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's call for 'Introducing new spurious correlation benchmarks for various fields and modalities' and 'Constructing new robustness benchmarks for various applications (medical, social, industrial, geographical, etc.)'. It also touches upon evaluating different architectures and methods, further aligning with the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (need for controlled benchmarks in medical AI), the core proposal (using GANs to factorize and control spurious vs. core features), and the intended use (controlled corruption, counterfactual evaluation, robustness metrics) are well-explained. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise nature of the 'synthetic' dataset (fully generated vs. augmented real data) and the specific GAN techniques, but the overall concept and goals are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While GANs for data generation are common, applying them specifically to factorize core vs. spurious features (like scanner artifacts vs. pathology) and generate images with *controlled* levels of these features for the explicit purpose of creating a *robustness benchmark* in medical imaging is innovative. It moves beyond relying on naturally occurring group differences (which offer less control) and proposes a more systematic way to study and evaluate robustness against specific, known spurious correlations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While GANs and medical imaging techniques exist, successfully training a GAN to accurately disentangle subtle spurious features (e.g., device profiles) from core features (e.g., lesions) and generate high-fidelity medical images with precise, controllable injection of these features is technically demanding. It requires substantial expertise, computational resources, and potentially carefully annotated data for training and validation. Ensuring the generated artifacts are realistic is a key challenge."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Robustness against spurious correlations is a critical issue in medical AI due to potential risks to patient safety and equity. Current benchmarks often lack the fine-grained control needed for rigorous evaluation. This proposal directly addresses this gap by aiming to create a benchmark with explicit control over spurious features, which could greatly facilitate the development, testing, and comparison of robust models and mitigation techniques, ultimately contributing to more reliable AI in healthcare."
