        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for 'comprehensive evaluation benchmarks', 'automated methods for detecting spurious correlations', addressing scenarios where 'spurious correlation is unknown or annotations are missing', and examining 'LLMs and LMMs'. The 'AutoSpurious' idea directly targets these points by proposing an automated framework using explainability to detect potentially unknown spurious correlations and generate benchmarks, specifically mentioning applicability to LLMs and LMMs. It fits squarely within the workshop's first key objective and topic area regarding new benchmarks and automated detection."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation highlights a specific problem (scalability and limitations of human-annotated benchmarks). The main idea outlines a logical flow: using explainability tools to identify influential features, perturbing/masking them to create stress tests, analyzing cross-modal interactions, and synthesizing benchmarks. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated. Minor ambiguity might exist in the exact mechanism of 'synthesizing' the benchmark suite from the perturbed examples, but overall the concept is articulated concisely and is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using explainability methods to understand model behavior or identify influential features is established, the novelty lies in the proposed automated pipeline connecting explainability-driven feature identification directly to the systematic generation of robustness benchmarks, particularly for *unknown* or *non-human-aligned* spurious correlations. Automating the discovery and benchmark creation process, rather than relying on pre-defined spurious attributes, offers a fresh perspective. Applying this systematically to multimodal data and cross-modal interactions further enhances its innovative aspect."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current technology. Explainability techniques (feature attribution, attention) are available, and data perturbation/masking is technically possible. However, practical implementation faces challenges: 1) Scalability and computational cost of explainability methods on large models/datasets. 2) Reliability and faithfulness of current explainability tools. 3) Automatically defining meaningful 'features' and appropriate 'perturbations' across diverse data types can be complex. 4) Validating that the automatically identified influential features are indeed 'spurious' requires careful experimental design. Despite these hurdles, the core components exist, making it feasible with dedicated research and engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in robustness research: the reliance on limited, manually curated benchmarks for spurious correlations. Automating the detection of potentially unknown biases and generating corresponding benchmarks could drastically improve the scale, scope, and relevance of robustness evaluations. This is crucial for developing more reliable AI systems, especially complex models like LLMs and LMMs operating in open-world scenarios. Success would provide the community with valuable tools and insights, directly contributing to the workshop's goal of advancing model reliability and generalization."
