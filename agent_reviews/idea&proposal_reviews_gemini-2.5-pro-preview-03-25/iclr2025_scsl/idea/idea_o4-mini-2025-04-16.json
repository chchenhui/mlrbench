        "justification": "The idea directly addresses the core theme of the workshop: spurious correlations and shortcut learning. It specifically targets the challenge of robustness when spurious features are unknown and group labels are unavailable, which is highlighted as a key objective and gap in the task description ('Current evaluations do not inform us about the scenarios when the spurious correlation is unknown or annotations are missing', 'Finding solutions for robustness to spurious correlation when information regarding spurious feature is completely or partially unknown'). AIFS proposes a novel robustification method, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope and topics of interest."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main components (encoder, intervention module, dual loss, attribution feedback), and overall goal are well-defined. The concept of using synthetic interventions in latent space guided by sensitivity is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise nature of the 'style' perturbations, the mechanism for learning intervention masks, and the specific attribution method used, but the core proposal is comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using interventions for robustness isn't entirely new, the proposed mechanism of adaptive, synthetic interventions in latent space, guided by gradient-based sensitivity analysis and without requiring group labels, offers a fresh perspective. Combining learned latent perturbations, a dual invariance/sensitivity objective, and an iterative feedback loop based on attribution appears to be a novel approach compared to existing methods that often rely on known groups or predefined augmentations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea seems largely feasible with current machine learning techniques. It leverages standard components like pretrained encoders and gradient-based attribution. Implementing latent space perturbations and a custom loss function is practical. However, the training loop involving interventions and sensitivity analysis might add computational overhead and complexity. Tuning the intervention parameters (type, strength, subspace selection) and balancing the dual objectives could present moderate implementation challenges, requiring careful engineering and experimentation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and impact potential. It tackles the critical and pervasive problem of spurious correlations, particularly in the challenging setting where they are unknown a priori. Developing methods that automatically identify and mitigate reliance on such correlations without needing explicit labels would be a major advancement for building robust and reliable AI systems. Its modality-agnostic claim further broadens its potential applicability and impact across various domains."
