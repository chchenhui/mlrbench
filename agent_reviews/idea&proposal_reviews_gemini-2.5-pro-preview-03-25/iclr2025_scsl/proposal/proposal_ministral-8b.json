        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-aligned with the task description (workshop on spurious correlations), the research idea (AIFS), and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for novel solutions for building robust models, particularly focusing on the challenging scenario where spurious features are unknown (a key topic mentioned in the workshop objectives and literature review challenges). The proposed method, AIFS, is a direct elaboration of the provided research idea. It tackles a core problem highlighted in the literature review (identifying spurious features without supervision). Minor deduction because it doesn't explicitly position itself against *all* specific methods in the lit review, but the alignment with the core problem and proposed solution type is strong."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines the high-level concept, motivation, and components of AIFS reasonably well. The objectives and expected outcomes are clearly stated. However, significant ambiguity exists in the core methodological details. The nature of the 'style perturbations' and the mechanism for selecting/adapting latent subspaces are vague. Most importantly, the mathematical formulation of the dual-objective loss is unclear and potentially flawed. The invariance loss is defined as a standard classification loss without explicit reference to consistency across interventions, and the sensitivity loss formulation (gradient dotted with latent representation) lacks clear justification and interpretation. These ambiguities hinder a complete understanding of how the method works precisely."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel combination of existing concepts. Using synthetic interventions in latent space is related to data augmentation and causal intervention ideas. Combining this with a dual loss for invariance and sensitivity, and adaptively guiding these interventions using gradient-based attribution specifically targeting sensitive dimensions, appears to be a relatively new approach. It distinguishes itself from methods requiring group labels, simple feature reweighting, or specific architectures mentioned in the literature review. While individual components (interventions, gradient attribution, invariance principles) exist, their integration into an adaptive loop for unsupervised spurious feature mitigation presents notable originality."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal's motivation and high-level approach (using interventions to promote invariance) are sound and grounded in established principles. However, the technical soundness of the proposed methodology is questionable due to the lack of clarity and justification for the mathematical formulation of the loss function. The definition provided for the invariance loss doesn't explicitly enforce consistency under intervention, and the sensitivity loss term is non-standard and its effectiveness in penalizing reliance on spurious dimensions is not well-argued or theoretically supported. The reliance on gradient attribution to identify *spurious* (not just sensitive) directions needs stronger justification or empirical validation. The assumption that a standard pretrained encoder provides a suitable latent space without potentially amplifying spurious correlations itself could also be a weakness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal seems largely feasible to implement using standard deep learning frameworks. It relies on a pretrained encoder, gradient computations, and custom loss functions, which are common practices. Publicly available datasets are proposed for evaluation. However, challenges exist in designing the specific 'style' perturbations, implementing the adaptive subspace selection mechanism effectively, tuning the hyperparameters (like lambda and attribution frequency), and managing the computational cost of the intervention loop and periodic attributions. While not straightforward, these challenges appear manageable within a typical research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and persistent problem in machine learning: robustness to spurious correlations, especially when these are unknown. Developing a method that can automatically discover and mitigate such correlations without explicit supervision would be a major contribution. Success would lead to more reliable, generalizable, and potentially fairer AI models, aligning perfectly with the goals of the workshop and addressing a key challenge highlighted in the literature. The potential impact on both fundamental understanding and practical applications is substantial."
