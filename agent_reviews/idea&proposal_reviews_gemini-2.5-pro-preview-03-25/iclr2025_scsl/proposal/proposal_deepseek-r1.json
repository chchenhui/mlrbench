    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for novel robustification methods, particularly those tackling unknown spurious correlations without group labels ('Finding solutions for robustness... when information regarding spurious feature is completely or partially unknown'). It elaborates precisely on the core research idea (adaptive latent interventions guided by sensitivity). Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself against methods mentioned in the literature review (SPUME, RaVL, GroupDRO, last-layer reweighting) and aims to overcome key challenges identified (unsupervised identification, generality across modalities), demonstrating a deep understanding of the context and prior work."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly listed and unambiguous. The methodology section provides a coherent overview, followed by specific algorithmic steps with clear mathematical formulations for sensitivity scores and loss functions. The experimental design is detailed, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and implementation choices. Expected outcomes are quantified, and the overall structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor details like the exact Gumbel-Softmax implementation could be elaborated, but the core concepts and plan are immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. The core idea of using adaptive, gradient-based sensitivity scores to guide synthetic interventions specifically in the *latent space* for *unsupervised* mitigation of spurious correlations is a novel combination of existing concepts (gradient attribution, invariance learning, synthetic data). It clearly distinguishes itself from supervised methods (GroupDRO), methods relying on external models or specific priors (SPUME, RaVL), and simpler representation penalties (ElRep). While it builds on known techniques, their synthesis and application to unsupervised latent intervention represent a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages well-established concepts like gradient attribution for feature importance, KL divergence for invariance, and the general principle of penalizing reliance on perturbed features. The mathematical formulations for sensitivity and the dual-objective loss are correct and clearly presented. The iterative adaptation mechanism is logical. The main assumption – that high-sensitivity latent dimensions are primary carriers of spurious correlations – is plausible but requires strong empirical validation, which the proposal plans to undertake. The use of Gaussian noise is a standard starting point for perturbations. Overall, the methodology is well-justified and technically robust, pending experimental confirmation of the core hypothesis."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. The core components (pretrained encoders, gradient computation, KL divergence, Gumbel-Softmax) are standard in deep learning frameworks. The proposed methodology does not require exotic hardware or data. The additional computational cost associated with calculating sensitivity scores periodically and the dual forward passes (original and perturbed) seems manageable and within the realm of typical deep learning training overhead. The experimental plan uses standard benchmarks. While hyperparameter tuning might require effort, the overall approach is realistic and execution appears straightforward with current resources and knowledge."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and challenging problem of mitigating *unknown* spurious correlations without supervision, a major hurdle for deploying reliable AI in real-world, high-stakes applications (like medicine, autonomous systems, as mentioned). Success would represent a substantial advancement over methods requiring group labels or domain-specific knowledge. The potential for a modality-agnostic solution further increases its impact. It directly aligns with the workshop's goals and has the potential to contribute foundational insights into the interplay between optimization, attribution, and invariance."
