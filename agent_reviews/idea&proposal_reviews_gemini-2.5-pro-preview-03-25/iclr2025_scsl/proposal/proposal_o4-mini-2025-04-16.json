        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for novel robustification methods, particularly those operating without group labels or prior knowledge of spurious features ('when information regarding spurious feature is completely or partially unknown'). It faithfully elaborates on the AIFS research idea, detailing the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, it situates itself well within the provided literature, acknowledging related works (SPUME, ElRep cited as baselines) and explicitly aiming to tackle key challenges identified, such as identifying spurious features without supervision and scalability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the AIFS components, including mathematical formulations for the intervention and loss functions, and clear pseudocode for the iterative loop. Implementation details and the experimental design (datasets, baselines, metrics, ablations) are specific and easy to follow. The structure is logical, progressing from motivation to method, evaluation, and expected impact."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like gradient attribution and data augmentation/intervention exist, the core idea of using an iterative loop where gradient-based sensitivity *dynamically guides* synthetic *latent space* interventions (via a learned mask) specifically to enforce invariance *without group labels* appears novel. It differs significantly from methods requiring group labels (GroupDRO, IRM), external knowledge (SPUME), simple reweighting (Izmailov et al., Hameed et al.), or architectural penalties (ElRep). The unsupervised, adaptive nature of identifying and mitigating spurious dimensions in the latent space is a key innovative aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon the plausible intuition that dimensions highly sensitive to the classification loss are likely candidates for spurious features and that enforcing invariance to perturbations along these dimensions should improve robustness. The methodology is well-described with clear mathematical formulations for the intervention mechanism and the dual-objective loss. The iterative attribution-intervention loop provides a concrete mechanism for adaptation. The inclusion of both invariance (L_\\\\mathrm{inv}) and sensitivity (L_\\\\mathrm{sens}) terms in the loss, coupled with updating the intervention mask M based on sensitivity, seems coherent. The experimental design includes relevant benchmarks, strong baselines, and necessary ablation studies. Minor areas for deeper justification might include the precise interaction between L_\\\\mathrm{sens} and the mask update, and the assumption that gradient magnitude is always the best indicator of spuriousness across all contexts, but the overall approach is technically well-grounded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal appears highly practical and implementable. The core components (standard encoders, gradient computation, noise injection, standard optimizers) are readily available in common ML frameworks. The proposed method does not require exotic hardware or data. The plan to use standard benchmarks (Colored MNIST, Waterbirds, CelebA) and architectures (ResNet-50, MLP) is realistic. The claim of modest computational overhead (10-20% over ERM) seems plausible, as the main additions are noise sampling, forward pass on perturbed latents, and gradient accumulation for the mask update. Hyperparameter tuning (\\alpha, \\beta, \\sigma, k, m, \\eta) is required but standard in ML research. The experimental plan is detailed and achievable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: the lack of robustness due to reliance on unknown spurious correlations, particularly when explicit supervision (like group labels) is unavailable. This is a major barrier to deploying reliable and fair AI systems. If successful, AIFS could provide a widely applicable, unsupervised method to improve worst-group performance and OOD generalization across various modalities (as suggested by the planned experiments on image, tabular, and potentially text data). The potential impact spans theoretical understanding (latent interventions), practical tools for practitioners, and societal benefits (fairer AI). The diagnostic potential of identifying spurious latent dimensions is also a valuable contribution."
