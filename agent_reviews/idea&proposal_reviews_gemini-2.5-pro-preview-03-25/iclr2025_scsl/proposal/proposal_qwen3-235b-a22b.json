        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for novel robustification methods, particularly for scenarios where spurious feature information is unknown (a key objective). It elaborates clearly on the AIFS idea presented. Furthermore, it effectively positions itself within the recent literature, citing relevant works (ElRep, SPUME, ULE, RaVL, etc.) and explicitly stating how AIFS aims to overcome their limitations (e.g., reliance on supervision or prior knowledge). It also connects to foundational aspects mentioned in the task description, like understanding learning dynamics and the role of gradients."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-structured and clearly written. The background, motivation, objectives, and overall system overview are understandable. However, there are significant ambiguities and potential inconsistencies in the core technical details. Specifically, the formulation of the sensitivity loss (L_sens) and the mask update rule based on Integrated Gradients (IG) seems counter-intuitive or possibly incorrect as presented. The mask update formula assigns higher weights (more intervention) to dimensions with lower absolute IG, while the sensitivity loss appears to reward (due to the negative sign) high gradients in masked dimensions. This contradicts the stated goal of penalizing reliance on potentially spurious (high-gradient) dimensions identified for intervention. These core mechanistic details require substantial clarification or correction for the proposal to be fully understood and evaluated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like invariance regularization, gradient attribution, and interventions exist, the proposed AIFS framework combines them in a novel way: using iterative gradient attribution to dynamically guide synthetic interventions in the latent space for unsupervised mitigation of *unknown* spurious correlations. This adaptive, label-free approach distinguishes it from methods requiring group labels (like IRM variants), those using fixed penalties (ElRep), meta-learning with external knowledge (SPUME), or teacher-student architectures (ULE). The dynamic coupling of attribution and intervention within the training loop is a key innovative aspect."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is built upon relevant concepts like invariant learning and gradient-based feature attribution. However, its soundness is significantly weakened by the questionable formulation of the sensitivity loss and the mask update mechanism, as noted under Clarity. If these core components are mathematically flawed or incorrectly described, the proposed method's ability to achieve its stated goals is undermined. While the overall idea of using interventions guided by feature importance is plausible, the specific implementation details presented lack rigor or clear justification, casting doubt on the technical soundness. Further validation or correction of these formulas is necessary."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible. It leverages standard deep learning components (encoders, classifiers, optimizers) and established techniques (Integrated Gradients). The proposed alternating optimization scheme is implementable. The computational overhead associated with calculating gradients periodically seems manageable, aligning with the <15% estimate. The experimental plan uses standard datasets and benchmarks, and the required resources (compute, standard architectures) are readily available in typical research environments. Potential challenges exist in hyperparameter tuning, but the overall approach does not rely on fundamentally unavailable technology or data."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and challenging problem in machine learning: robustness to unknown spurious correlations. Developing effective unsupervised methods for this issue would be a major advancement, crucial for deploying reliable AI in real-world settings, especially with large foundation models where exhaustive annotation is impossible. The potential impact is substantial, offering a practical tool for robustification and contributing theoretical insights into intervention dynamics in deep learning. It aligns perfectly with the workshop's priorities on new robustification techniques and understanding foundational mechanisms."
