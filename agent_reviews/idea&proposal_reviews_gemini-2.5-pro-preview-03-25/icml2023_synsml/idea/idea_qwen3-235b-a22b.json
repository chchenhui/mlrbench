        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the workshop's theme of combining scientific and machine learning modeling. It explicitly proposes integrating biophysical equations (scientific models) with deep learning (ML models) using PINNs. The application domain (Oncology/Biology/Health) is directly relevant to the workshop's scope, addressing the 'Real-world application' topic by showing how scientific models (tumor growth equations) can leverage ML and raw data (MRI) for enhanced prediction. It also touches upon methodological aspects (PINNs architecture, adaptive loss weighting) relevant to the second topic."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (limitations of purely mechanistic or data-driven models), the main approach (PINNs integrating physics constraints with MRI data), a specific innovation (adaptive loss weighting), the data modality (multi-modal MRI), and the expected outcomes (improved prediction, interpretability, reduced data reliance). The problem, proposed solution, and potential benefits are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While PINNs are an existing methodology and their application to biological systems including tumor growth has been explored, the proposed combination with multi-modal MRI data (specifically ADC and contrast enhancement) for spatiotemporal prediction, coupled with an 'adaptive weighting' strategy for the physics loss, offers a fresh perspective. The novelty lies more in the specific application, the integration of particular data types, and the refinement of the PINN methodology (adaptive weighting) for this complex problem, rather than a fundamentally new modeling paradigm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. PINNs require careful tuning, especially regarding the balancing of data-driven and physics-based loss terms (which the adaptive weighting aims to address). Access to high-quality, longitudinal, multi-modal MRI datasets is critical and can be a bottleneck. Expertise in both deep learning (PINNs) and medical physics/oncology is necessary. While challenging, the required components (PINN frameworks, MRI data processing) exist, making the project feasible with appropriate resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Accurate prediction of tumor growth and treatment response is a critical unmet need in oncology. Improving predictive accuracy, enhancing interpretability (via physics constraints and parameter estimation), and potentially reducing reliance on large datasets could lead to major advancements in personalized cancer therapy, adaptive radiotherapy planning, and clinical decision support. Success in this area would have substantial clinical relevance and could serve as a model for integrating physics and ML in other biomedical domains."
