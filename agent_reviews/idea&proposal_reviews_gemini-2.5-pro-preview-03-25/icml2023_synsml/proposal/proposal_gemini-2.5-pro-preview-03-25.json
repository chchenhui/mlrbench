    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the SynS & ML workshop's core theme of combining scientific and ML models, fitting into the 'Methodological and theoretical study' track. It systematically expands the research idea of 'Differentiable Scientific Models as Adaptive Layers', elaborating on the motivation, mechanism, and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it effectively uses the literature review to position the work, contrasting the proposed adaptive approach with existing methods like PINNs (Refs 5-10) and standard differentiable hybrid models (Refs 1-4), and explicitly aims to tackle key challenges identified in the review (Interpretability - Challenge 1, Data Efficiency/Generalization - Challenge 2, Integration - Challenge 5)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to objectives, methodology, and impact. Key concepts like 'adaptive differentiable scientific layers' and the joint optimization of ML and scientific parameters (\\theta_{ML}, \\theta_{Sci}) are explained precisely. The mathematical formulation is clear, and the methodology section provides concrete details on implementation strategies (algebraic, ODEs, PDEs) and a comprehensive experimental design. The objectives are specific and measurable. The language is concise and unambiguous, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building upon existing concepts like differentiable programming (Refs 1, 4) and hybrid modeling, the core idea of treating the scientific model as a *differentiable layer with learnable internal parameters* (\\theta_{Sci}) that adapt during end-to-end training alongside neural network parameters (\\theta_{ML}) offers a distinct and innovative approach. This contrasts significantly with PINNs (Ref 5), which typically enforce fixed physics via the loss function, and standard differentiable simulators that may not focus on adapting internal model parameters based on data in this integrated manner. The emphasis on *adaptivity* of the scientific component itself for improved accuracy, generalization, and interpretability constitutes the main novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations, including automatic differentiation, gradient-based optimization, and established scientific modeling principles. The proposed methodology, leveraging existing AD libraries and differentiable solvers, is technically well-founded. The mathematical formulation for joint optimization is correct. The experimental design is particularly strong, featuring relevant baselines, diverse metrics (including parameter recovery and OOD generalization), and specific experiments like ablation and sensitivity analysis. Potential challenges like parameter identifiability and optimization complexity are acknowledged, which is realistic. While solutions to these challenges are part of the research itself, the overall approach and evaluation plan are rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard and accessible technologies like PyTorch/JAX and existing differentiable solvers. The plan to start with simpler scientific models (e.g., ODEs, basic PDEs) before potentially scaling up is practical and reduces initial risk. The use of synthetic data for validation is straightforward. Key challenges include the potential technical difficulty in differentiating highly complex scientific code and ensuring stable joint optimization, along with potential high computational costs. However, these are recognized research risks rather than fundamental roadblocks, and the proposed phased approach makes the initial stages highly achievable within a typical research project scope."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in both pure ML (data-hungriness, lack of interpretability) and pure scientific modeling (rigidity, idealized assumptions), directly targeting the core goals of the SynS & ML workshop. If successful, the proposed adaptive hybrid models could lead to substantial advancements: enhanced accuracy and generalization, improved data efficiency, increased interpretability through physically meaningful learned parameters (\\hat{\\theta}_{Sci}), and even potential for scientific discovery by highlighting model discrepancies. This work could provide a powerful new tool for numerous scientific domains and contribute to building more robust and trustworthy AI systems, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration."
