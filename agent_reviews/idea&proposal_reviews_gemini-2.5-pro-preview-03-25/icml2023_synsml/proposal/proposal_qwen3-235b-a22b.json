        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of synergizing scientific and ML modeling by proposing a concrete method (adaptive differentiable layers). The methodology clearly stems from the research idea (jointly optimizing scientific and ML parameters) and is well-situated within the context of the provided literature (PINNs, differentiable hybrid modeling, UQ), explicitly aiming to overcome limitations mentioned (fixed parameters, computational complexity, UQ). The proposed applications (climate, biomedical) fit the workshop's scope, and the focus on improving both scientific models (adaptability) and ML (data efficiency, generalization) matches the task's dual goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context effectively, the motivation is compelling, and the core idea (jointly learnable scientific and ML parameters) is articulated precisely. The methodology section provides a logical breakdown of the approach, including mathematical formulations, architecture description, loss function design, and a detailed experimental plan with specific datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablations. Expected outcomes and potential impact are clearly stated and ambitious. The structure is logical and easy to follow, with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While differentiable hybrid modeling and PINNs exist, the core novelty lies in treating the scientific model's intrinsic parameters (e.g., diffusion coefficients, Reynolds number) as learnable variables within an end-to-end differentiable framework, alongside ML parameters. This contrasts with many existing approaches where such parameters are often fixed or calibrated separately. The proposal clearly articulates this distinction and its potential benefits (self-calibration, adaptability). While building on existing concepts like differentiable programming, the specific approach of making the scientific model itself adaptive via learnable parameters represents a significant and innovative step."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (differentiable programming, AD, physics-informed learning) and cites relevant state-of-the-art work. The proposed methodology, involving differentiating through numerical solvers (using tools like JAX) and joint optimization with a physics-informed loss, is well-justified and aligns with current research trends. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines and metrics. Minor potential weaknesses include the inherent complexity and potential stability issues of optimizing disparate parameter types jointly, and ensuring robust differentiability for complex solvers, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology (differentiable programming libraries like JAX, GPU computing) and available data sources (reanalysis data, simulation setups). The plan is detailed and realistic for the synthetic and potentially the biomedical case. However, significant challenges exist, particularly regarding the computational cost and scalability of differentiating through complex, large-scale scientific models like WRF. Joint optimization might also require careful tuning. While the proposal acknowledges computational aspects (parallelization, GPUs), successfully implementing and training the full system, especially for the climate application, will require substantial computational resources and expertise, introducing moderate risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem at the intersection of scientific modeling and ML: bridging the gap between rigid first-principle models and data-hungry, less interpretable ML models. The potential impact is substantial. Successfully developing adaptive scientific layers could lead to more accurate, robust, and interpretable models in critical domains like climate science and biomedicine. The concept of self-calibrating models that adapt to data while respecting physics is transformative. Furthermore, providing interpretable insights through learned physical parameters and extending UQ frameworks adds significant value. The plan to open-source libraries enhances community impact."
