        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of synergizing scientific and ML modeling by proposing a methodological study ('Differentiable Scientific Models as Adaptive Layers'). The objectives (develop framework, joint learning, evaluation, address challenges) perfectly match the research idea's core concepts. Furthermore, the proposal explicitly builds upon the cited literature (PINNs, differentiable hybrid models) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified (interpretability, data efficiency, UQ, complexity, domain knowledge integration). It fits squarely within the workshop's scope, targeting both methodological advancements and potential real-world applications mentioned in the task description and idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, flowing from introduction and objectives to methodology, expected outcomes, and impact. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section clearly outlines the steps involved, including high-level algorithmic descriptions and mathematical notation that effectively convey the core concepts of embedding differentiable layers and joint optimization. Evaluation metrics are explicitly stated. There is minimal ambiguity, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality within the rapidly evolving field of hybrid modeling. While building on existing concepts like PINNs and differentiable hybrid models (as evidenced by the literature review, e.g., Fan et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023), the specific focus on embedding scientific models as *adaptive layers* where *scientific parameters* are jointly learned alongside ML parameters offers a fresh perspective. It represents a strong step towards truly integrated and self-calibrating systems, moving beyond using physics primarily as a regularizer in the loss function. While not a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift compared to the most recent cited works, its emphasis on adaptability and joint parameter learning provides clear distinction and value."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of machine learning (neural networks, gradient-based optimization, automatic differentiation) and leverages recent advancements in differentiable programming and physics-informed ML, supported by the literature review. The proposed methodology (embedding, architecture, joint optimization, evaluation) is logical and follows standard research practices. The high-level technical formulation is correct and clearly illustrates the concept. The proposal acknowledges key challenges in the field, indicating a good understanding of the research landscape. While the specifics of making *any* scientific model differentiable are non-trivial and not fully detailed, the overall conceptual framework is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible, as similar approaches are being explored in the literature (e.g., FSI, geosciences). Key technologies like automatic differentiation frameworks exist. However, significant challenges remain. Making complex, legacy scientific code differentiable can be a major undertaking, potentially requiring substantial code rewriting or the use of surrogates. The feasibility heavily depends on the specific scientific models chosen, which are not specified. Furthermore, addressing all listed challenges (interpretability, data efficiency, UQ, complexity, domain knowledge) within a single project is ambitious. While the core idea is implementable, practical hurdles and the breadth of objectives introduce moderate risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses fundamental limitations of both pure ML (interpretability, data hunger, physical inconsistency) and traditional scientific models (rigidity, idealized assumptions). Successfully developing adaptive hybrid models that jointly learn ML and scientific parameters could lead to major advancements in scientific discovery and engineering applications (climate, healthcare, etc., as mentioned). It directly contributes to the workshop's goal of fostering synergy and has the potential to produce more accurate, reliable, interpretable, and data-efficient models, representing a substantial contribution to the field."
