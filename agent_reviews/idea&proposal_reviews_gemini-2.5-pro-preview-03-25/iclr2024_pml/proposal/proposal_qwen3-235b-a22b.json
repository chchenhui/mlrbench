    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of connecting privacy regulation (GDPR) with ML techniques (DP, FL). It elaborates precisely on the research idea, detailing the mechanisms for regulation-sensitive feature tagging, dynamic budget allocation, secure aggregation, and audit logging. Furthermore, it explicitly references relevant papers from the literature review (Shahrzad et al., 2025; Mengchu et al., 2024; Abhinav et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2023) and aims to tackle key challenges identified therein, such as balancing privacy/utility, regulatory compliance, and adaptive budget allocation. There are no discernible inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology section breaks down the approach into logical components (Feature Classification, Budget Allocation, Secure Aggregation, Audit Logging) with specific algorithms, formulas, datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The overall architecture is described, although the placeholder figure doesn't add visual clarity. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise optimization details for adjusting gamma via SGD or the specifics of the ZKP implementation, but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. While dynamic DP and feature-level DP have been explored, the core novelty lies in explicitly linking the dynamic allocation of per-feature privacy budgets to *regulatory risk classifications* (e.g., GDPR special categories) derived automatically via NLP and rules. This regulation-sensitive approach, combined with FL and a dedicated compliance audit trail using blockchain/ZKP, represents a significant departure from standard uniform DP or time-adaptive DP (Shahrzad et al., 2025). It offers a new perspective on operationalizing legal privacy requirements within technical DP frameworks, clearly distinguishing itself from prior work cited in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical foundations of differential privacy (Gaussian mechanism, composition theorem) and federated learning (secure aggregation protocols like Bonawitz et al., 2017). The methodology for feature classification (rules + NLP) is plausible, and the budget allocation mechanism is mathematically defined. The use of standard DP techniques (clipping, noise addition) and secure aggregation is appropriate. The audit logging via blockchain and ZKP is technically sound for ensuring immutability and verifiable compliance. Minor areas for improvement include potentially using advanced composition for tighter privacy bounds and providing more justification/analysis for the SGD-based adaptation of the allocation parameter gamma. Technical formulations are generally correct and clearly presented."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technologies but presents notable implementation challenges. Required components like FL frameworks, NLP models, DP libraries, secure aggregation protocols, and blockchain platforms are available. Standard datasets are proposed. However, integrating these diverse components (ML, DP, NLP, Crypto, Blockchain) into a cohesive system requires significant expertise and effort. Tuning the dynamic budget allocation (especially the SGD part) and ensuring the robustness of the NLP classifier will require careful experimentation. Implementing ZKP for compliance verification adds complexity. While achievable, the project requires substantial resources and specialized skills, carrying moderate implementation risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely challenge of reconciling advanced ML techniques (FL) with stringent privacy regulations (GDPR), a major barrier to adoption in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. By proposing a method to improve the utility-privacy trade-off specifically tailored to legal requirements and providing built-in auditability, the research has the potential for major advancements. It could directly influence how organizations implement privacy-preserving ML, contribute methodologically to DP research, and offer a practical way to operationalize regulatory principles like data minimization and accountability."
