    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (focusing on privacy regulation like GDPR, DP, FL, auditability), the research idea (Regulation-Sensitive Dynamic DP in FL), and the literature review (addressing challenges like privacy-utility trade-off, regulatory compliance, dynamic budget allocation). It directly tackles the intersection of these areas, proposing a concrete solution that fits the workshop's themes and builds upon/differentiates from existing work mentioned in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. Objectives, methodology steps, and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. However, some technical details lack precision. For instance, the function for sensitivity scoring `f(m_i, n_i)` is abstract, the 'lightweight NLP classifiers' are not specified, and the mathematical formulation for noise injection (`sigma_i^2 = epsilon_i^2 / 2`) appears incorrect for standard DP mechanisms like Gaussian or Laplace, which could cause confusion. Secure aggregation and audit log implementation details are also minimal. Despite these points, the overall concept and research plan are understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While dynamic DP and FL are established fields (as shown in the literature review, e.g., time-adaptive DP), the core idea of dynamically allocating DP budgets *per-feature* based on *automatically classified regulatory sensitivity* using metadata and NLP is innovative. This specific mechanism for aligning DP with fine-grained regulatory requirements within an FL framework, coupled with an audit log for accountability, distinguishes it from prior work focusing on uniform DP, user-level DP, or time-adaptive budgets."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is conceptually sound in its motivation and overall approach (addressing uniform DP limitations via sensitivity). However, it suffers from weaknesses in technical rigor. The mathematical formulation for noise injection variance (`sigma_i^2 = epsilon_i^2 / 2`) seems incorrect for standard DP definitions and needs correction or clarification based on the specific DP mechanism intended. The method for feature sensitivity classification relies on 'lightweight NLP classifiers' whose effectiveness and reliability for accurately capturing nuanced regulatory sensitivity across diverse datasets (healthcare, finance) are not substantiated. The definition of the sensitivity scoring function is abstract. While the overall research design is plausible, these specific technical gaps weaken the proposal's soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Implementing dynamic DP allocation and secure aggregation is technically possible using existing primitives. However, accurately classifying feature sensitivity automatically using metadata and 'lightweight NLP' across complex domains like healthcare and finance could be difficult and require significant effort in feature engineering and model validation. Accessing suitable, realistic, sensitive datasets for FL that allow for this type of feature-level analysis might be a major hurdle due to privacy constraints. Achieving the claimed 'up to 30% utility gain' requires empirical validation and might be optimistic. The 'real-world testing' component also adds complexity."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of AI/ML, privacy, and regulation (GDPR). Improving the privacy-utility trade-off in FL by incorporating regulatory nuances is highly relevant for deploying FL in sensitive sectors like healthcare and finance. Successfully aligning technical DP mechanisms with legal requirements and providing auditability features could substantially increase trust, compliance, and practical adoption of privacy-preserving ML, representing a major potential contribution to the field."
