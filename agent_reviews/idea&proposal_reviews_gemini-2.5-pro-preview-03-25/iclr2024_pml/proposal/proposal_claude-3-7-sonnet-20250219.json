    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on the relationship between privacy regulation (GDPR) and ML, privacy-preserving techniques (DP, FL), and auditability. It perfectly embodies the research idea by proposing regulation-sensitive dynamic DP in FL, including feature tagging, dynamic budgets, secure aggregation, and audit logs. It effectively incorporates and builds upon the cited literature, acknowledging prior work on non-uniform DP (Xu et al. 2023, Kiani et al. 2025) while clearly distinguishing its novel contribution focused on feature-specific regulatory sensitivity. The proposal tackles key challenges identified in the literature review, such as balancing privacy/utility, regulatory compliance, and adaptive budget allocation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes/Impact), and the objectives are clearly stated. The methodology is broken down into understandable components (Tagging, Allocation, Aggregation, Logging) with formulas and descriptions provided. The experimental design is detailed and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for calculating feature importance (w_i) without privacy leakage during FL, the specifics of adapting secure aggregation for feature-level noise, and the exact pre-training data for the NLP classifier. However, these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity and understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building on existing concepts like FL, DP, NLP, and secure aggregation, the core idea of automatically tagging features based on *regulatory sensitivity* (using metadata and NLP) and dynamically allocating *feature-specific* DP budgets accordingly within an FL framework is novel. This contrasts with uniform DP and time-adaptive DP (Kiani et al. 2025). The integration of an explicit compliance audit log mechanism tailored to these feature-specific guarantees further enhances the novelty. It offers a fresh perspective on aligning technical privacy mechanisms with legal requirements, clearly distinguishing itself from the reviewed literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages well-established foundations (FL, DP theory, secure aggregation principles, NLP). The methodology for sensitivity tagging (metadata + NLP) and dynamic budget allocation (using sensitivity tiers and feature importance) is plausible, although the practical effectiveness of the tagging and the privacy implications of calculating feature importance (w_i) need careful validation. The application of feature-specific Gaussian noise based on derived budgets is theoretically sound under DP. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant baselines, comprehensive metrics (utility, privacy, compliance), ablation studies, and sensitivity analysis. Collaboration with legal experts adds to the soundness of the compliance evaluation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technologies (TFF, TF Privacy, BERT, secure aggregation protocols). However, implementation presents moderate challenges. Integrating the components, particularly the automated tagging, dynamic budget mechanism, and adapting secure aggregation for feature-specific noise, requires significant engineering effort and expertise. The effectiveness of the NLP classifier depends on appropriate training data and fine-tuning. Accessing sensitive datasets (MIMIC-III) requires approvals, and securing collaboration with legal experts is necessary. The computational overhead of feature-specific processing and potentially adapted secure aggregation needs assessment. Overall, the plan is realistic but requires dedicated resources and expertise, with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of reconciling advanced ML techniques (FL) with stringent privacy regulations (GDPR) in sensitive domains. Standard DP's limitations in handling varying data sensitivity are a known practical barrier. Successfully developing a regulation-sensitive DP mechanism could significantly enhance the practical adoption of privacy-preserving FL, improve the privacy-utility trade-off, and provide a much-needed mechanism for demonstrating regulatory compliance through the audit log. It bridges technical and legal perspectives and has strong potential to influence both research and practice in trustworthy AI."
