        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed for the workshop, including 'Efficient methods for privacy preserving machine learning', 'Differential privacy theory and practice', and 'Privacy for large language models'. The focus on balancing privacy (DP) and utility (task performance) in the context of LLMs fits squarely within the workshop's scope of exploring technical solutions for privacy protection in ML."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (privacy risks and computational cost of DP in LLMs), the core proposal (applying DP noise specifically to PEFT parameters), the hypothesis (better privacy/utility trade-off and efficiency), and the evaluation plan (theoretical analysis and empirical studies). It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While DP and PEFT are existing concepts, the specific proposal to integrate DP *exclusively* with the low-rank updates of PEFT methods like LoRA/Adapters for LLMs is innovative. It offers a fresh perspective on making DP practical for large models by targeting the efficiency bottleneck, moving beyond standard DP applied to all parameters during fine-tuning. It's a clever combination applied to a timely problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly practical and implementable. PEFT methods are readily available and widely used. Standard DP mechanisms (like DP-SGD) can be adapted to target only the gradients of PEFT parameters. The core idea actually *reduces* the computational burden compared to full DP fine-tuning, making it more feasible. Required resources (LLMs, compute, standard libraries) are accessible within typical ML research environments. Potential challenges lie in optimal noise calibration and privacy accounting, but these are research tasks rather than fundamental feasibility barriers."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Enabling privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs on sensitive data with lower computational cost and better utility is a critical challenge. Success would address a major bottleneck, potentially allowing the safe deployment of LLMs in regulated domains like healthcare or finance. It directly tackles the crucial trade-off between privacy, utility, and efficiency for state-of-the-art models."
