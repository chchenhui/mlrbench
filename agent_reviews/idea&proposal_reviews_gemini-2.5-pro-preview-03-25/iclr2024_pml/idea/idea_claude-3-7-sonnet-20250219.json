        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task focuses on 'Privacy Regulation and Protection in Machine Learning', and explicitly lists 'Privacy for large language models', 'Efficient methods for privacy preserving machine learning', 'Differential privacy theory and practice', and 'Relationship of privacy regulation (such as GDPR) to machine learning' as topics of interest. The proposed idea directly addresses these by suggesting an efficient, privacy-preserving method (combining selective tuning and local DP) for fine-tuning LLMs, aiming for GDPR compatibility. It tackles a core challenge within the workshop's scope."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (privacy risks in LLM fine-tuning) and the core concept (hybrid approach combining selective parameter tuning and targeted local DP) are well-explained. The two main phases (parameter identification and targeted noise injection) are distinct. However, the specifics of the 'sensitivity analysis' method for parameter identification and the exact mechanism for the 'dynamic privacy budget allocation' could be elaborated further for perfect clarity. Overall, it's well-defined but minor refinements would enhance precision."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by proposing a specific combination of existing concepts in a new context. While selective parameter fine-tuning (e.g., parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA) and differential privacy (including local DP) are known techniques, the novelty lies in: 1) Using sensitivity analysis specifically to identify parameters *for targeted privacy application*, not just efficiency. 2) Combining this selective approach with *local* DP applied only to those parameters in a distributed setting. 3) Adding a dynamic privacy budget allocation based on parameter importance/data sensitivity. It's a novel synthesis and refinement tailored to the LLM fine-tuning privacy problem, rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible with current technology and knowledge. Parameter sensitivity analysis methods exist, parameter-efficient fine-tuning is common, and local differential privacy mechanisms are understood. Implementing targeted noise injection on specific parameters within existing frameworks is achievable. The main challenges likely lie in the computational cost of robust sensitivity analysis for large models and the complexity of designing and implementing the dynamic privacy budget allocation mechanism effectively. Integration of these components requires careful engineering but doesn't seem dependent on major theoretical breakthroughs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive, private, or proprietary data is a critical capability for many valuable applications (healthcare, finance, personalization), but privacy concerns and regulations like GDPR are major obstacles. Existing privacy methods often incur substantial utility loss for complex models like LLMs. Developing methods that demonstrably improve the privacy-utility trade-off, as proposed here, would address a critical bottleneck and could unlock significant practical applications, making it a highly important research direction."
