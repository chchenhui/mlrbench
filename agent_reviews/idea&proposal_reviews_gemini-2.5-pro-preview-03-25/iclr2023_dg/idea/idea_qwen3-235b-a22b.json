        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly seeks approaches for successful domain generalization (DG) by identifying and leveraging additional sources of information. This idea directly addresses this by proposing to use multi-modal data as the 'additional information' source. It falls squarely under the workshop's topic of interest: 'Exploiting multiple modalities to achieve robustness to distribution shift'. The motivation and proposed method directly tackle the core challenge outlined in the workshop description â€“ improving DG beyond standard baselines by using extra data signals (cross-modal consistency)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the main technical steps (modality-specific encoders, adversarial domain adaptation, Jointly Normalized Representations via normalization and cross-modal contrastive learning, fusion, classification) are laid out logically. The concept of JNRs is introduced and defined. The evaluation plan is specified. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact architecture details or the specific formulation of the normalization and contrastive loss, but the overall research direction and methodology are clearly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using multi-modal data, adversarial domain adaptation, and contrastive learning are existing concepts, their specific combination for domain generalization by enforcing alignment of 'Jointly Normalized Representations' (JNRs) appears innovative. The novelty lies in the structured approach: first achieving intra-modality domain invariance via adversarial learning, and then enforcing inter-modality alignment in a normalized space specifically for DG. It offers a fresh perspective on leveraging cross-modal signals as a supervisory mechanism for domain invariance, going beyond simpler fusion techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core components rely on established techniques like deep neural networks, adversarial training, and contrastive learning, which are implementable with current deep learning frameworks. Multi-modal datasets suitable for DG exist in the proposed domains (medical imaging, autonomous driving). The main challenges would be acquiring appropriately paired multi-modal data across diverse domains and carefully tuning the multiple components of the loss function (adversarial, contrastive, classification), which is standard in complex ML projects. No fundamentally new or unavailable technology is required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Domain generalization is a critical bottleneck for deploying reliable ML systems in the real world, especially in high-stakes areas like healthcare and autonomous driving, which are explicitly targeted. Multi-modal data is increasingly prevalent in these domains. Developing methods that effectively leverage this data to improve robustness against domain shifts could lead to major advancements. Successfully demonstrating that cross-modal consistency can be exploited for better DG would be a valuable contribution, directly addressing the workshop's central question and potentially leading to more robust AI systems."
