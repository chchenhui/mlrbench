    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly asks for ways to leverage additional information (like multiple modalities or domain metadata) for successful domain generalization (DG), which is precisely what the idea proposes. It directly addresses two key topics mentioned in the workshop description: 'Exploiting multiple modalities to achieve robustness to distribution shift' and 'Leveraging domain-level meta-data'. The goal of developing a model robust to distribution shift aligns perfectly with the workshop's central theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It outlines the core components: domain-adaptive attention, multi-modal input, meta-learning for weight adaptation, conditioning on domain metadata, and an adversarial component for invariance. The motivation and overall approach are understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architecture of the attention mechanism or the exact meta-learning update rule, but these are details expected to be refined during research. The core concept is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like multi-modal learning, attention, meta-learning, and adversarial domain adaptation exist, their specific combination proposed here – particularly the domain-adaptive attention mechanism dynamically weighting modalities based on meta-learned, domain-metadata-conditioned signals for invariant feature learning – offers a fresh perspective. It's not a completely groundbreaking concept but represents an innovative synthesis of existing techniques tailored effectively to the multi-modal DG problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It relies on established techniques like attention mechanisms, meta-learning, and adversarial training. The main challenges would be finding suitable multi-modal datasets with domain labels and metadata, the potential complexity of integrating all components effectively, and the computational cost associated with training such a model. However, these challenges seem surmountable with current ML expertise and resources, placing it in the 'Good' feasibility range."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Domain generalization is a critical challenge for deploying reliable ML systems, and the task description highlights the limitations of current methods. By proposing a structured way to leverage potentially richer information from multiple modalities and domain metadata, this research directly addresses a key bottleneck. If successful, it could lead to substantially more robust models and provide valuable insights into how different information sources contribute to generalization, making a meaningful contribution to the field."
