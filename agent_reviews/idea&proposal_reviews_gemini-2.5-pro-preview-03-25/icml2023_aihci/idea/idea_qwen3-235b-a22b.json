        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's theme of AI and HCI intersection. It directly addresses several listed topics, including 'Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)', 'Explainable and interpretable machine learning methods', 'Novel human interactions with models', and potentially 'Personalizable and correctable machine learning models' and 'Ethics and fairness'. The proposal focuses on enhancing RLHF, a core topic, by integrating HCI elements like natural language explanations and improving interpretability, directly tackling challenges at the intersection of AI and HCI as requested by the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of scalar rewards in RLHF) is well-explained, and the core proposal (jointly modeling rewards and explanations using a dual-model architecture) is understandable. The concept of a bidirectional loop and action justification is also presented. However, some implementation details, such as the precise mechanism for mapping explanations to reward modifiers or generating justifications, remain high-level, leaving minor ambiguities that would need further elaboration for full clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While RLHF and explainable AI are existing fields, the proposed method of integrating natural language explanations *directly* into the RLHF loop to dynamically modify the reward function and generate justifications in a bidirectional manner offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond standard RLHF (scalar rewards/preferences) and typical post-hoc XAI methods by creating a tighter, more interactive loop between human explanation and policy learning. This specific combination and mechanism appear innovative."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires integrating complex components (RL policy network, sophisticated language model for explanation processing and generation). A major hurdle is data collection: obtaining paired scalar feedback and detailed natural language explanations at scale could be difficult and costly. Training the dual-model system and ensuring stable learning might also require considerable effort and experimentation. While conceptually sound within current AI capabilities, the practical implementation involves non-trivial engineering and data challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation in RLHF – the inadequacy of scalar rewards for capturing complex human intent – which is a major bottleneck for building truly aligned and trustworthy AI systems. Success could lead to major advancements in RLHF efficiency, policy robustness, user trust, and system transparency. The potential applications in areas like collaborative AI, personalized robotics, healthcare, and education, where interpretability and alignment are paramount, underscore its high potential impact on both AI and HCI fields."
