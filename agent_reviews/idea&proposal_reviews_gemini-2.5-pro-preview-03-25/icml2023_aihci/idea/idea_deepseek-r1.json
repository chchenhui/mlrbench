        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (AI and HCI workshop). It directly addresses several listed topics, including 'Personalizable and correctable machine learning models', 'Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)', 'Novel human interactions with models', and 'Tools and datasets'. The motivation and proposed solution sit squarely at the intersection of AI (RLHF, fine-tuning) and HCI (user interaction, natural language feedback, accessibility), matching the workshop's core theme."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (natural language feedback for model correction), proposed two-stage approach (parser + RLHF), and expected outcomes (benchmark, tools) are well-defined. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific implementation details of the language parser or the exact nature of the RLHF reward mechanism derived from feedback, but the overall research direction is understandable and precise."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like RLHF, fine-tuning, and natural language interaction exist, the specific combination aimed at enabling non-expert users to directly correct general model behaviors (beyond typical LLM alignment) via intuitive language feedback presents a fresh perspective. The focus on creating a dedicated framework and benchmark for this type of user-driven correction adds to its novelty within the AI/HCI space."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology. Natural language processing for intent extraction is achievable, RLHF is an established (though resource-intensive) technique, and lightweight fine-tuning is practical. Integrating these into a human-in-the-loop system is plausible. Key challenges will involve the robustness of the language parser, the sample efficiency of the RLHF process based on potentially sparse/ambiguous user feedback, and designing effective user interaction loops, but these seem like addressable research/engineering problems rather than fundamental roadblocks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the important problem of making AI models more accessible and adaptable for non-expert users. Success could lead to more trustworthy, personalized, and fair AI systems, particularly in HCI-centric applications like accessibility tools or creative assistants. Democratizing model correction and providing open-source tools/benchmarks would be valuable contributions to the AI and HCI communities."
