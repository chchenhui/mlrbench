        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of 'Promises and Pitfalls from Theory to Deployment' in computational sustainability. It proposes a concrete pathway (the EcoML-Edge framework) to bridge this gap, tackles common challenges mentioned (dynamic environments, low signal-to-noise data, changing conditions via Domain-Adversarial Pretraining and the Simulator), aims to establish best practices and quantify success (Multi-Objective Dashboard), and focuses on real-world deployment challenges (Edge-Device Runtime, Feedback Hub). The motivation explicitly mentions issues like duplicated effort and unrevealed failure modes, which aligns with the workshop's goal to identify common failure modes and high-impact research directions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation, main idea, components, validation plan, and overall goal are articulated concisely and logically. The breakdown into five distinct modules with specific functions (Simulator, Pretraining, Runtime, Dashboard, Feedback Hub) makes the framework easy to understand. The target application areas and metrics provide concrete context. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While individual components like digital twins, domain adaptation, edge ML, and monitoring dashboards exist, the novelty lies in their specific integration into a cohesive, end-to-end framework explicitly designed for the challenges of deploying ML in computational sustainability, particularly focusing on edge environments. The combination of domain-adversarial pretraining for sustainability concept drift, edge-specific runtime with on-device learning, and a multi-objective sustainability dashboard within a single deployment-centric framework offers a fresh perspective tailored to the field's needs."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building and integrating all five complex components (especially the digital twin simulator, robust edge runtime with on-device learning, and automated feedback loop) into a single, robust, open-source framework is a substantial engineering effort. Validation requires access to real-world data, edge hardware, and deployment scenarios in two distinct domains (precision irrigation, wildlife poaching), which can be difficult to secure and manage. While technically plausible using existing methods, the scope is ambitious and requires considerable resources, expertise, and time."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in computational sustainability: translating research prototypes into effective real-world deployments. By providing a standardized framework, reusable code, and evaluation metrics, it could significantly lower the barrier to entry, reduce duplicated effort, and accelerate progress towards achieving UN SDGs using ML. Tackling issues like robustness to drift, edge deployment constraints, and quantifiable multi-objective impact is crucial for the field. Success would represent a major advancement in operationalizing sustainable AI."
