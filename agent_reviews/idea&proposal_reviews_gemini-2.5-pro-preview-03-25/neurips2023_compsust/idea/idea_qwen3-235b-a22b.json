        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research addressing the 'path from theory to deployment' in computational sustainability, highlighting 'pitfalls' like models failing under real-world conditions (noisy data, changing conditions, biased data) which prevent advances on benchmarks translating to real impact. The research idea directly targets this gap by proposing a robustness benchmark simulating these exact pitfalls (sensor noise, missing data, distributional shifts) and a framework to improve model resilience for deployment in environmental challenges, directly contributing to the workshop's theme and goals of identifying pathways, best practices, and common failure modes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly articulates the problem (deployment gap in CompSust). The main idea concisely outlines the proposed solution: a benchmark suite with specific perturbation types (sensor noise, missing data, shifts), a framework combining specific techniques (adversarial training, UQ, data augmentation), integration of stakeholder feedback, and clear evaluation metrics (PRS, deployment success rates). The expected outcomes (guidelines, tools) are also clearly stated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea has notable originality. While robustness benchmarking and techniques like adversarial training or UQ exist in ML, the novelty lies in (1) creating a *dedicated benchmark suite specifically tailored to computational sustainability deployment challenges* with environmentally relevant perturbations, (2) proposing a *holistic framework* combining multiple robustness techniques specifically for this domain, and (3) explicitly integrating *stakeholder feedback* into the robustness evaluation loop for CompSust. It's a novel synthesis and application focused on a critical, under-addressed area within CompSust, rather than introducing fundamentally new ML algorithms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core components – benchmarking environmental tasks (species monitoring, deforestation), simulating perturbations (noise, missing data, shifts), and applying known techniques (adversarial training, BNNs, data augmentation) – rely on existing methods and datasets. Creating the benchmark suite and framework requires significant engineering effort but uses established concepts. The main potential challenge lies in rigorously defining and measuring 'deployment success rates' across diverse real-world scenarios, which might require careful proxy definition or collaboration for case studies. Simulating complex, long-term distributional shifts (e.g., climate patterns) realistically could also pose some difficulty but is generally tractable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck ('pitfalls from theory to deployment') explicitly highlighted in the workshop call, which currently hinders the real-world application of computational sustainability models for achieving UN SDGs. By providing standardized tools (benchmarks, frameworks) to evaluate and improve deployment readiness, this research could significantly reduce duplicated effort, accelerate the translation of research into practice, and lead to more reliable and impactful environmental solutions. It directly contributes to identifying failure modes and best practices, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
