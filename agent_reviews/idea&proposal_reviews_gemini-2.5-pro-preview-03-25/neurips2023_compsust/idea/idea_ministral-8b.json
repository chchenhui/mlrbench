    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Promises and Pitfalls from Theory to Deployment' by proposing a MARL framework explicitly aimed at deployment in urban planning for sustainability. It tackles key computational sustainability challenges mentioned in the task, such as complex multi-agent systems and multi-objective problems (balancing stakeholder needs and sustainability metrics). The focus on urban planning aligns with addressing UN SDGs and the goal of achieving broader impacts beyond theoretical models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main concept (MARL for urban planning), methodology steps, and expected outcomes are outlined. However, some aspects lack detail. The specific role and integration of computer vision are not fully explained. The nature of the simulation environment and the specifics of agent objectives/constraints need further elaboration. Crucially, the plan for 'deployment' and bridging the sim-to-real gap lacks concrete details, which is a critical aspect given the workshop's theme."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea possesses satisfactory novelty. While using MARL for aspects of urban systems (like traffic) isn't entirely new, the proposed approach integrates MARL, potentially CV, and multi-agent systems specifically for holistic sustainable urban planning, considering diverse stakeholders (residents, businesses, planners) with potentially conflicting goals. The explicit focus on creating a deployable framework addressing the theory-to-deployment gap in this specific context adds a layer of novelty. However, it primarily combines existing techniques in a new application area rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or theories."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The idea faces significant feasibility challenges. 1) Data: Acquiring comprehensive, high-fidelity, real-time data for an entire urban system is extremely difficult and costly. 2) Simulation: Building and validating a sufficiently realistic simulation environment capturing complex urban dynamics (social, economic, environmental) is a massive undertaking. 3) MARL: Training MARL agents in such a complex, large-scale simulation is computationally intensive and prone to issues like non-convergence and defining appropriate multi-objective rewards. 4) Deployment: The sim-to-real transfer is notoriously difficult, especially for complex systems like cities. Directly deploying such a system for real-world planning decisions involves significant risks and ethical considerations. The path to actual deployment seems highly challenging with current technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Sustainable urban planning is a critical global challenge directly linked to multiple UN SDGs and affects billions of people. Developing effective computational tools to optimize urban sustainability by balancing environmental, economic, and social factors would be a major advancement. If successful, the research could lead to tangible improvements in urban quality of life (e.g., reduced pollution, better resource management, improved infrastructure usage) and provide valuable insights for policymakers. It directly addresses core goals of the computational sustainability field."
