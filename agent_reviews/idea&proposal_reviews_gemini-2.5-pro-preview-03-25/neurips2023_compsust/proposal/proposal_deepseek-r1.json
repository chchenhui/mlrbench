    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the CompSust-2023 workshop themes of 'theory to deployment' and 'promises and pitfalls'. It incorporates all key elements from the research idea (multimodal data, ensemble ML, transfer learning, interpretability, community-centered deployment, edge computing, SDGs). The methodology explicitly builds upon and cites relevant papers from the literature review (WaveCastNet, SENSE, ethics papers, etc.) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified (data scarcity, interpretability, ethics, real-time processing, multimodal integration). The objectives and significance sections clearly link the proposed work to computational sustainability principles and the specific goals outlined in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, the methodology section provides significant detail on data, algorithms (including equations), interpretability methods, experimental design, and validation. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow. The rationale connecting the problem, proposed solution, and expected impact is well-explained. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanisms for continuous community feedback integration into model updates or the full details of the edge deployment architecture, but these do not significantly hinder understanding of the core proposal. The language is generally precise, though dense with technical terms appropriate for the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, primarily through the specific integration of multiple advanced techniques and its strong focus on community-centered deployment within the disaster EWS context. While individual components (multimodal fusion, transfer learning, interpretability, edge computing, community engagement) exist in the literature (as reviewed), the proposed framework synthesizes them in a novel way. Specifically, adapting recent seismic models (WaveCastNet, SENSE) for broader disaster types and integrating them with social media/satellite data, using adversarial domain adaptation for transfer learning in this context, and embedding this technical core within a participatory design and edge deployment strategy offers a fresh approach. It's not groundbreaking in terms of inventing entirely new algorithms but is innovative in its specific combination, adaptation, and application focus aimed squarely at bridging the theory-deployment gap."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in machine learning (ensemble methods, transfer learning, attention, CNNs, interpretability techniques) and references recent, high-quality research (WaveCastNet, SENSE). The proposed methodology is detailed, technically coherent, and includes appropriate choices for data processing, modeling (with correct-looking formulations), interpretability, and evaluation (baselines, metrics, case studies, qualitative/quantitative validation). The inclusion of ethical considerations and fairness metrics strengthens its rigor. Minor weaknesses include the inherent challenge of adapting models across different disaster types and integrating highly heterogeneous data, but the overall approach is well-justified and technically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. The technical complexity is high, involving the integration of multiple advanced ML components and diverse data sources. Data acquisition (especially reliable IoT sensor data and potentially restricted social media data) and deployment logistics in target regions (Bangladesh, Nepal) could be significant hurdles requiring strong local partnerships and resources. The ambition to achieve specific quantitative improvements (e.g., 15% F1 increase, 40% data reduction) adds pressure. Meaningful community co-design and establishing trust also require substantial time and effort. While building on existing tools helps, the overall scope requires significant expertise, computational resources, funding, and robust project management to succeed fully. The risks associated with data access, model integration, and real-world deployment are considerable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical global challenge of natural disaster resilience, directly contributing to multiple UN SDGs (1, 11, 13). By focusing on the theory-to-deployment gap in computational sustainability, it tackles a core issue highlighted in the workshop call. The potential impacts are substantial: improved early warnings could save lives and reduce economic losses in vulnerable communities. Scientifically, it promises contributions to multimodal learning, transfer learning, interpretable AI, and community-centered ML design. The emphasis on ethical considerations and sharing pitfalls further enhances its significance to the CompSust community. Success would provide a valuable blueprint for deploying ML in other high-stakes sustainability domains."
