    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the CompSust 2023 theme of 'Promises and Pitfalls from Theory to Deployment' by proposing a framework explicitly designed to bridge this gap in the context of disaster management. The objectives (multimodal fusion, interpretability, transfer learning, community-centered deployment) perfectly match the research idea and tackle key challenges identified in the literature review (data scarcity, interpretability, ethics, real-time processing, multimodal integration). The proposal consistently references the workshop's goals and the cited literature throughout, ensuring strong coherence."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to specific objectives, detailed methodology, and expected impact. Each objective is clearly stated, and the corresponding methodology section provides specific details on data sources, preprocessing steps, ML models, evaluation metrics (including formulas), and validation strategies. The language is precise and academic, making the research plan readily understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components (e.g., using CNNs for image data, transfer learning, SHAP for interpretability, community engagement) exist in the literature, the novelty lies in the proposed *integrated framework* that holistically combines these elements specifically for sustainable, community-centered disaster EWS in low-resource settings. The emphasis on co-designing interpretable outputs with communities and systematically integrating local knowledge alongside multimodal data fusion and transfer learning represents a fresh and comprehensive approach to bridging the theory-deployment gap in this domain. It synthesizes and extends existing work in a novel configuration."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in machine learning (ensemble methods, transfer learning, interpretability techniques like SHAP/LIME, multimodal fusion) and disaster risk management. The proposed methodology is robust, detailing specific techniques, models (CNNs, RNNs, GBTs, etc.), and validation procedures (spatio-temporal cross-validation, comprehensive metrics including POD, FAR, CSI, fairness assessment). The inclusion of uncertainty quantification methods and specific interpretability techniques strengthens the technical rigor. The plan acknowledges potential challenges (like data quality) and proposes relevant mitigation strategies (transfer learning)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some significant practical challenges. The reliance on publicly available data (satellite, weather) is feasible, but access to high-quality ground sensor data and historical disaster records in low-resource settings might be difficult and depends on 'potential partnerships'. The ML techniques are implementable, but integrating all components into a robust framework requires significant engineering effort. The most challenging aspect is the community-centered deployment (Objective 4), which requires substantial time, resources, local trust-building, and expertise in participatory methods; its success is highly context-dependent. The overall scope is ambitious for a typical research project timeline."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical global challenge of disaster risk reduction in vulnerable communities, directly contributing to multiple UN SDGs (1, 11, 13). By focusing on the theory-to-deployment gap, it tackles a core issue highlighted by the CompSust community. Successful execution could lead to major advancements in EWS effectiveness, potentially saving lives and livelihoods. The emphasis on ethical AI, fairness, and community trust further enhances its significance. The expected outputs (open-source framework, datasets, protocols) promise substantial contributions to both research and practice."
