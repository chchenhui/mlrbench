    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses one of the four key topics explicitly mentioned in the task description: 'the community still lacks robust video-language alignment benchmarks, which makes it hard to evaluate and compare the capabilities of video-language models.' The proposed VL-AlignBench aims to create exactly such a benchmark, providing a unified framework for evaluation and comparison. It also implicitly touches upon the need for models handling multimodal data and efficiency, aligning well with the overall goals of the workshop described in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated, outlining the motivation (lack of standardized benchmarks), the main components (diverse tasks, modalities, domains, integration of existing/new data, multi-step metrics, efficiency score, leaderboard, diagnostic tools), and expected outcomes/impact. The purpose and structure of the proposed benchmark are well-defined. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specifics of the 'new synthetic and real-world video-text pairs' or the exact formulation of 'multi-step metrics', but the core concept is very clear and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While benchmark creation itself is not entirely novel, this proposal offers novelty through its comprehensive scope (diverse tasks, modalities, domains) and specific features. Key novel aspects include the integration of *new* synthetic/real-world data specifically targeting temporal causality and rare events, the inclusion of an efficiency score alongside performance metrics, and the provision of diagnostic tools. It combines existing approaches (using standard datasets) with new elements designed to address current evaluation gaps more thoroughly than existing, often narrower, benchmarks."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Integrating existing datasets (ActivityNet, How2Vid69M) is practical. However, creating *new* high-quality synthetic and, especially, real-world video-text pairs focused on specific phenomena like temporal causality and rare events requires significant effort in data collection, annotation, and validation. Developing robust multi-step metrics and diagnostic tools also demands careful design. While ambitious, the plan leverages existing resources and proposes a structured approach, making it feasible with adequate resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance, as explicitly stated in both the motivation of the idea and the workshop task description. A standardized, comprehensive benchmark for video-language alignment is a critical need in the field. Such a benchmark would enable objective model comparison, identify model strengths/weaknesses (e.g., temporal reasoning, handling long dependencies), drive progress, and facilitate reproducible research, directly accelerating the development and application of video-language models as targeted by the workshop."
