    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for robust video-language alignment benchmarks and the challenge of data scarcity by proposing a new annotated dataset focused on fine-grained temporal grounding. It perfectly elaborates on the research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology, and metrics for FineActionBench. Furthermore, it effectively situates the proposed benchmark within the context of the provided literature review, clearly identifying the specific gap (precise phrase-to-segment grounding) that existing works like TemporalBench, VideoComp, FIBER, and E.T. Bench do not fully cover, thus justifying its necessity."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The objectives (dataset curation, annotation protocol, metric definition, baseline evaluation, public release) are explicitly stated and unambiguous. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step plan for benchmark creation and evaluation, including specific video sources, annotation procedures, quality control measures, metric formulations (T-IoU provided), and experimental design. The rationale, problem statement, and significance are articulated concisely and persuasively. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty by targeting a specific, acknowledged gap in VLM evaluation: fine-grained temporal grounding of short textual phrases to precise video segments. While related benchmarks exist (as identified in the literature review), they focus on different aspects like temporal reasoning (TemporalBench), compositional/temporal negatives (VideoComp), retrieval biases (FIBER), or broader event understanding (E.T. Bench). FineActionBench's specific focus on dense, phrase-level annotations for this task, combined with tailored metrics like PL-T-IoU, represents a novel contribution to evaluation resources. The novelty lies primarily in the benchmark itself and its specific focus, rather than groundbreaking techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is well-grounded in the established challenges of VLM evaluation. The methodology for dataset creation (leveraging existing diverse datasets), annotation (detailed protocol including phrase generation, boundary marking, guidelines, and multi-annotator quality control with IAA), task definition (formal phrase-based temporal grounding), and metric selection (standard T-IoU, adapted PL-T-IoU, R@K) is robust and follows best practices. The T-IoU formula is correctly presented. The plan to evaluate diverse baseline models using both zero-shot and fine-tuning protocols is methodologically appropriate and comprehensive."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents a significant implementation challenge regarding annotation. Sourcing videos from existing datasets and implementing the evaluation metrics and baseline experiments are standard and practical. However, creating dense annotations (5-15 per minute) with high temporal precision for 1,000-1,500 videos, involving multiple annotators and rigorous quality control, is a very ambitious and resource-intensive task (both time and cost). Achieving high inter-annotator agreement on precise boundaries can also be challenging. While the plan is technically sound, its successful execution heavily depends on securing substantial resources for annotation, making this the main feasibility bottleneck."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal holds high significance for the VLM research community. It directly addresses a critical evaluation gap – the lack of standardized benchmarks for precise, phrase-level temporal grounding – which is explicitly mentioned as a challenge in the task description and literature review. By providing such a benchmark, FineActionBench has the potential to catalyze research into more temporally accurate VLMs, enable fair model comparison, guide the development of new architectures, and ultimately support progress in downstream applications requiring fine-grained temporal understanding (e.g., robotics, detailed video analysis). Its contribution as a community resource aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals."
