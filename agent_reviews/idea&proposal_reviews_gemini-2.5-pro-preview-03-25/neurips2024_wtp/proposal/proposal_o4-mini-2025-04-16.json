    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's identified need for robust video-language alignment benchmarks, particularly the lack of fine-grained temporal evaluation. It fully elaborates on the research idea of creating FineActionBench for precise phrase-to-segment mapping. Furthermore, it effectively positions itself within the context of the literature review, acknowledging related works (TemporalBench, VideoComp, FIBER, etc.) while clearly articulating its specific focus on dense, phrase-level temporal grounding, a niche not fully covered by existing benchmarks mentioned."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides detailed descriptions of dataset curation (video selection, annotation protocol, quality control), evaluation metrics (with formulas), baseline models, the proposed FineAlignNet architecture (including components, attention mechanism, segment prediction logic, and loss functions), and the experimental design. The structure is logical, flowing from motivation to methodology to expected outcomes, making it easy to understand the proposed work."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, primarily through the proposed benchmark, FineActionBench. While the literature review shows existing work on temporal understanding (TemporalBench, VideoComp) and fine-grained retrieval/grounding (FIBER, Grounded-VideoLLM, E.T. Bench), FineActionBench's specific focus on *dense, phrase-level temporal grounding* (mapping short textual phrases to precise start/end times in complex activities) appears to fill a distinct gap. The novelty lies in the task definition and the scale/density of the proposed annotations. The proposed model, FineAlignNet, while sound, combines established techniques (3D CNNs, Transformers, cross-attention, DP, contrastive/regression loss) and is less innovative than the benchmark itself."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds on solid foundations in video-language modeling. The methodology is well-thought-out: the data curation plan includes quality control measures (dual annotation, expert review); the evaluation metrics (T-IoU, R@K, MAE) are appropriate and clearly defined with correct formulations; the selection of baselines covers relevant existing approaches; the proposed FineAlignNet architecture is technically sound, using standard but effective components and a reasonable optimization strategy (joint contrastive and regression loss, DP for segment prediction). The experimental design includes ablation studies and statistical analysis, indicating methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible, particularly the modeling, evaluation, and baseline implementation aspects, given standard ML resources (PyTorch, GPUs). However, the creation of the dataset presents a significant feasibility challenge. Annotating 2,000 videos with ~25 dense phrase-to-segment mappings each (50,000 total instances), requiring dual annotators and expert review for quality, is a substantial undertaking demanding significant time, human resources, and funding. While feasible with adequate resources, the proposal doesn't detail the plan for managing this large-scale annotation effort, introducing a moderate degree of uncertainty or risk regarding the dataset creation timeline and cost."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and acknowledged gap in the video-language field: the lack of benchmarks for evaluating fine-grained temporal grounding of language. Such a benchmark is crucial for driving progress beyond coarse video-level understanding towards models that can precisely align language to specific moments in time. Success would provide a valuable resource for the research community, enabling standardized evaluation and fostering the development of models with direct applications in robotics, video editing, surveillance, and other areas requiring precise temporal understanding, as highlighted in the proposal and aligned with the task description's goals."
