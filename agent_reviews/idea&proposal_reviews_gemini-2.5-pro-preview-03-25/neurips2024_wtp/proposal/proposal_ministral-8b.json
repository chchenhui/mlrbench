    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's identified need for robust video-language alignment benchmarks, specifically focusing on the fine-grained temporal aspect mentioned in the research idea. The methodology builds upon the FineAction dataset cited in the literature review and aims to fill a gap not fully covered by other recent benchmarks like TemporalBench or VideoComp by focusing specifically on dense, phrase-level temporal grounding."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology (data collection, annotation, metrics, experiments, validation), and expected outcomes/impact are articulated concisely and logically. The T-IoU metric is explicitly defined. The structure is easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the project's goals and plan. Minor details like specific subset selection criteria or annotation tool specifics could be added, but the overall clarity is excellent."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers good novelty. While several benchmarks for temporal understanding exist (as shown in the literature review), FineActionBench's specific focus on *dense, phrase-localized* temporal grounding appears distinct. It differentiates itself from QA-focused (TemporalBench), compositionality-focused (VideoComp), retrieval-focused (FIBER), or event-level (E.T. Bench) benchmarks. The proposed 'phrase-localized T-IoU' metric tailored for this task also contributes to the novelty. It's not a completely new paradigm but carves out a specific, valuable niche within the broader area of video-language evaluation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon a well-established dataset (FineAction) and proposes standard methodologies for annotation (human annotators, QC) and evaluation (T-IoU, AP, SOTA model comparison, baseline). The validation plan including cross-validation and human evaluation adds to the rigor. The theoretical basis, addressing the limitations of coarse-grained evaluation, is solid. The main area requiring careful execution for soundness is ensuring the quality, consistency, and semantic richness of the dense phrase annotations, which is acknowledged but details on achieving consistency (e.g., inter-annotator agreement metrics) could be strengthened."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Leveraging the existing FineAction dataset significantly reduces the effort compared to collecting new videos. The primary challenge lies in the dense annotation process, which will be labor-intensive and require careful management, training, and quality control. However, by selecting a subset of FineAction and using specialized tools, the scope can be managed. Evaluating existing models and calculating the proposed metrics are standard procedures requiring accessible computational resources. The plan is realistic for a well-equipped research team."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and frequently cited gap (lack of fine-grained temporal alignment benchmarks) in the video-language field, as highlighted by the task description and literature review. Precise temporal understanding is crucial for many advanced applications (detailed search, summarization, robotics). By providing a dedicated benchmark and metrics for this capability, FineActionBench has the potential to drive substantial progress in model development and provide a standardized evaluation tool, complementing existing benchmarks and significantly impacting the research community."
