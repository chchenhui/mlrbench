    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal perfectly aligns with the task description's emphasis on the lack of robust video-language alignment benchmarks. It directly addresses this by proposing a benchmark specifically for fine-grained temporal alignment. It fully elaborates on the research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature review, acknowledging existing works like TemporalBench, VideoComp, and FIBER, while clearly articulating the unique gap FineActionBench aims to fill â€“ a dedicated benchmark for dense, phrase-level temporal grounding with specific metrics."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-structured. It logically progresses from the problem statement and literature gap to a detailed methodology (dataset creation, tasks, metrics, baselines, experiments) and expected impact. Key concepts like 'fine-grained temporal alignment' and the proposed metrics (e.g., PT-IoU) are clearly defined, including formulas. The objectives are explicit, and the methodology is described with sufficient detail to be understood. While minor details like annotator training specifics could be added, the overall proposal is highly understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the literature review shows related benchmarks exist (TemporalBench, VideoComp, FIBER, E.T. Bench), FineActionBench distinguishes itself by focusing specifically and comprehensively on *fine-grained phrase-to-segment temporal alignment* with *dense annotations* across diverse activity domains. The introduction of tailored evaluation metrics, particularly the Phrase-localized Temporal IoU (PT-IoU) incorporating semantic similarity, is a novel contribution for this specific evaluation goal. The inclusion of temporal relationship annotation adds another layer of novelty compared to benchmarks focused primarily on localization or retrieval alone."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is methodologically sound and rigorous. The dataset creation process includes clear criteria for video selection and a multi-stage annotation protocol with verification, aiming for high quality. The proposed benchmark tasks directly target the desired capabilities (localization, dense captioning, relationship reasoning). The evaluation metrics are well-motivated and mathematically defined, particularly PT-IoU's combination of temporal overlap and semantic relevance. The inclusion of diverse baseline methods and a comprehensive experimental plan (splits, ablations, human baseline, error analysis) strengthens the proposal's rigor. Minor concerns exist regarding the potential subjectivity in relationship annotation (causal, parent-child) and the precise operationalization of 'meaningful segments', but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically feasible in terms of implementing evaluation scripts, baselines, and a platform. However, the proposed scale of data annotation presents significant feasibility challenges. Curating 5,000 videos and generating dense annotations for ~100,000 segments (including descriptions, objects, and complex temporal relationships) through a multi-stage process with verification requires substantial human resources, time, and funding. Ensuring consistent, high-quality annotation, especially for subjective elements like relationships, across such a large dataset is a major undertaking and represents the primary risk to successful implementation within a typical research project scope and timeline."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant gap in the field of video-language understanding, as highlighted by the task description and literature review. Fine-grained temporal alignment is crucial for numerous real-world applications (e.g., assistive tech, content moderation, robotics), yet current benchmarks often lack the focus and granularity needed to drive progress in this specific capability. By providing a dedicated dataset, tailored metrics, and a standardized evaluation platform, FineActionBench has the potential to significantly impact the field, guiding the development of more temporally precise models and enabling more meaningful comparisons between approaches."
