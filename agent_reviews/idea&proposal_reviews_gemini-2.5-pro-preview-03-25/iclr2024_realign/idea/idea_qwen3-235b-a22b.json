        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the central theme by proposing a method to measure alignment across diverse systems (biological/artificial, different modalities) and implicitly offers a way to intervene (by optimizing representations towards the learned metric). Specifically, it tackles the key questions regarding 'robust and generalizable measures of alignment that work across different domains and types of representations', 'how current alignment metrics have advanced understanding and what approaches to explore next', and touches upon 'shared computational strategies' by seeking a unified metric space. The focus on bridging neuroscience and ML aligns perfectly with the workshop's interdisciplinary nature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core technical approach (self-supervised contrastive learning, Siamese network, domain adversarial training), types of data involved (fMRI, CNN, LLM), and the goal (unified metric space) are well-defined. The evaluation plan and expected impact are also clearly stated. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise definition of 'structural similarities' across highly disparate domains or the specifics of the contrastive loss function design for such heterogeneity, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While contrastive learning and domain adversarial training are established techniques, their combined application to create a *single, unified metric space* for representational alignment across *highly diverse domains* like brain activity, computer vision models, and language models represents a novel approach. Existing methods often focus on pairwise comparisons or specific types of representations. This proposal aims for a more universal, learned metric, which offers a fresh perspective compared to traditional methods like RSA or CKA, especially with the explicit goal of domain invariance enforced through adversarial training."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The core components (Siamese networks, contrastive loss, adversarial training) are well-understood in ML. Accessing relevant datasets (public fMRI, model activations) is possible, although potentially requiring significant effort or collaboration. Key challenges include: 1) Defining meaningful positive/negative pairs for contrastive learning across fundamentally different data types (e.g., fMRI vs. text embeddings). 2) The computational cost associated with training potentially large models on diverse, large datasets. 3) Ensuring the learned metric genuinely captures meaningful alignment rather than superficial correlations. Despite these challenges, the approach is technically sound and implementable with sufficient resources and careful design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully developing a unified, domain-agnostic alignment metric would be a major advancement for fields studying intelligence, directly addressing a critical limitation of current tools. It holds the potential to unlock deeper understanding of shared computational principles between biological and artificial systems, improve model interpretability, facilitate better model-brain alignment studies, enable cross-modal AI system analysis, and potentially guide the development of more human-aligned AI. The potential impact spans neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning, aligning perfectly with the workshop's interdisciplinary goals."
