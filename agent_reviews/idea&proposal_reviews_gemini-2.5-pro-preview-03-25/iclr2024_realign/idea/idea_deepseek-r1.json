        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme by proposing a method to compare representations across different systems (biological vs. artificial) and domains. Specifically, it tackles the key questions regarding the development of more robust and generalizable measures of alignment, understanding shared computational strategies through conserved features, and potentially enabling interventions based on alignment scores. The motivation explicitly mentions the limitations of current metrics, which is a core concern of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (invariant feature spaces via domain adaptation), proposed methods (adversarial/contrastive learning), and validation strategy are outlined. However, there's a minor typo ('fMRI. deep. deep network activations') that slightly obscures one example. Additionally, the precise operational definition of 'functional equivalence' within the invariant space could benefit from further elaboration, though the overall concept is understandable. Minor refinements would enhance precision."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While representational comparison and domain adaptation are established fields, the specific proposal to leverage domain adaptation techniques (adversarial/contrastive) to explicitly construct *invariant feature spaces* for the purpose of *cross-domain representational alignment* (especially between disparate types like fMRI and DNNs) offers a fresh perspective. It combines existing concepts in a novel way to address the specific challenge of domain-agnostic alignment, moving beyond standard similarity metrics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The proposed machine learning techniques (adversarial training, contrastive learning) are well-established. Required data types (fMRI, model activations) are accessible, either through public datasets or direct experimentation/collaboration. Implementation requires expertise in ML and potentially neuroscience/cognitive science, which is standard for this interdisciplinary field. While computational costs and the precise tuning of the domain adaptation process might pose moderate challenges, there are no fundamental roadblocks apparent with current technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Developing a robust, domain-agnostic metric for representational alignment would be a major contribution, addressing a critical limitation in comparing biological and artificial intelligence. Success could lead to deeper insights into universal computational principles, improved methods for evaluating and aligning AI with human cognition/neural processes, and potentially enable novel interventions to guide model development or understand neurological conditions. It directly addresses fundamental questions at the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and cognitive science."
