        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (Workshop on Representational Alignment). It directly addresses multiple key questions posed by the workshop: (1) It proposes a novel measurement approach beyond current metrics (Question 2). (2) It explicitly aims to develop 'more robust and generalizable measures of alignment that work across different domains and types of representations' (Question 3). (3) It seeks to provide insights into 'shared computational strategies' by finding optimal probes (Question 1). (4) It includes developing a tool to 'systematically increase (or decrease) representational alignment' via regularization (Question 4). The motivation and expected outcomes directly map onto the workshop's central theme and specific interests."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of fixed probes) and the core concept (adaptive meta-probe via bi-level optimization) are explained well. The proposed evaluation domains and expected outcomes are also clear. However, some technical details remain slightly ambiguous, such as the specific architecture of the meta-probe network, the precise nature of the self-supervised/weakly supervised signals for the inner loop, and the exact form of complexity regularization. While sufficient for a proposal, minor refinements could enhance precision."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While comparing representations across domains and using probes are established practices, the core concept of a *meta-learned*, adaptive probe optimized via a bi-level framework is innovative. Existing methods typically use fixed (e.g., linear) or pre-defined probes. Learning the optimal probe functions (f, g) dynamically based on the specific representational pair and task context, and training this capability across diverse tasks for generalization, represents a significant departure and offers a fresh perspective on measuring alignment."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Bi-level optimization is known to be computationally intensive and can be difficult to train stably. Training a meta-probe network effectively would likely require substantial and diverse datasets spanning multiple domains (vision, neuroscience, language, behavior), which might be challenging to acquire and curate. While the underlying components (neural networks, optimization algorithms, similarity metrics) exist, successfully implementing and tuning the proposed framework, especially the meta-learning aspect across diverse data types, requires considerable effort and computational resources. It's achievable but not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental limitation of current representational alignment techniques â€“ the reliance on potentially suboptimal, fixed probes. Developing a robust, adaptive, and generalizable alignment metric could lead to major advancements in understanding shared principles between biological and artificial intelligence. The ability to not only measure but also potentially manipulate alignment systematically offers a powerful tool for research across machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science. Success would yield critical insights into cross-system computations and provide a valuable benchmark."
