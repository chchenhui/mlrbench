        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (Workshop on Representational Alignment). It directly addresses the central theme of understanding when and why systems learn aligned representations and how computational strategies might differ despite representational similarity. Specifically, it tackles key workshop questions such as: 'To what extent does representational alignment indicate shared computational strategies?', 'How have current alignment metrics advanced our understanding... and what measurement approaches should we explore next?', and implicitly 'How can we systematically increase (or decrease) representational alignment?' by proposing methods for deeper analysis that could inform interventions. The focus on moving beyond scalar metrics to comparative causal analysis fits perfectly with the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation highlights the limitations of current methods effectively. The main idea is broken down into three components (probing, interventions, taxonomy), making the proposed framework understandable. Concepts like 'informational subspaces', 'causal dependencies', and 'surface-level vs. deep structural alignment' convey the intended direction well. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of 'orthogonal probing' in this context and the practicalities of comparative 'lesioning/ablation' across biological and artificial systems, but the overall concept is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While representational similarity analysis, probing, and lesioning/ablation exist as techniques, the novelty lies in their proposed integration into a *comparative causal framework* specifically designed to contrast biological and artificial systems. Moving beyond correlational alignment metrics (like RSA) or simple probing towards identifying causal dependencies between representational components to understand *how* computational strategies differ is a fresh perspective. Developing a taxonomy of alignment patterns based on these deeper analyses also adds to the novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The ML components (probing models, ablating units) are generally feasible. However, the comparative aspect involving biological systems is challenging. Targeted interventions like 'lesioning' in biological systems are complex, ethically constrained, often imprecise, and difficult to equate directly with in silico ablation. Accessing appropriate, high-resolution neural data synchronized with relevant tasks for both systems is also a hurdle. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation of the comparative causal analysis, especially the intervention part, would require considerable effort, potentially relying on simulations or approximations for the biological side, thus impacting the directness of the comparison."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation in the current study of representational alignment â€“ the inability of standard metrics to distinguish between superficial similarity and shared computational mechanisms. Understanding these differences is crucial for advancing AI interpretability, ensuring AI safety (by identifying potentially brittle or alien computational strategies), and building more robust theories in cognitive science and neuroscience. Developing methods for deeper, causal comparisons could lead to major advancements in our fundamental understanding of both biological and artificial intelligence."
