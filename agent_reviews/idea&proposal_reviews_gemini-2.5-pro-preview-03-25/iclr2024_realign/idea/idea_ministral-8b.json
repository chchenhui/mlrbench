        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's call for developing 'more robust and generalizable measures of alignment that work across different domains and types of representations' by proposing dynamic metrics for multimodal systems. It also tackles the question of 'what measurement approaches should we explore next?' by suggesting a novel DL+RL framework. The focus on dynamic environments implicitly relates to understanding 'when and why' alignment changes, fitting the workshop's central theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of static metrics) and the core proposal (dynamic metrics via DL+RL) are understandable. However, the specifics of the RL component, particularly the nature of the 'feedback from the environment' and the precise reward function for optimizing alignment, lack detail. Clarifying how the RL agent interacts with the environment and what constitutes successful alignment maximization would improve precision."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While representational alignment metrics exist, the concept of using reinforcement learning to *dynamically adapt* the alignment metric itself based on environmental feedback or changing data streams is innovative. Most current metrics are static calculations. Applying RL not just to learn representations but to optimize the *measure* of their alignment in real-time offers a fresh perspective compared to existing approaches like RSA or CKA."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Training deep learning models for representation analysis is standard. However, formulating the dynamic alignment problem within an RL framework requires careful design. Defining the state space, action space (how the metric is adjusted), and especially the reward signal (what constitutes 'better' alignment dynamically?) is non-trivial and crucial for success. Obtaining meaningful 'feedback from the environment' in real-time could also be complex depending on the specific application. Significant effort and potentially novel RL formulations might be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Developing robust, dynamic alignment metrics for multimodal systems would address a key limitation in the field. Such metrics could significantly improve our ability to compare and understand representations in complex, evolving systems (both artificial and potentially biological), enhance interoperability between AI agents, and provide new tools for studying learning and adaptation. It directly contributes to a core challenge highlighted by the workshop."
