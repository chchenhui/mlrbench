    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core questions of the Re-Align workshop, such as comparing biological and artificial representations, developing robust metrics, understanding shared computational strategies, and enabling interventions. The methodology (IFANs using hybrid adversarial-contrastive loss + behavioral congruence) is a direct implementation of the research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly builds upon and aims to extend the methods discussed in the literature review (CDA, CDCL), acknowledging their contributions while proposing improvements to handle cross-domain challenges like modality differences and incorporating behavioral data, which were identified as key issues."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the overall structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes) is logical. The core IFAN framework, including the hybrid loss function components (adversarial, contrastive, task-specific), is explained with mathematical formulations. The training protocol and evaluation metrics are also clearly outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise architecture details for encoders beyond general types (MLP/CNN), the specifics of the 'adaptive' contrastive loss beyond false negative mitigation, and the lack of detail on the 'neuro-guided loss functions' within the methodology section itself (though mentioned as an outcome). However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the core techniques (adversarial domain adaptation, contrastive learning) are established and their combination has been explored (e.g., CDA in the literature review), the proposal introduces novelty in several ways: 1) Explicitly incorporating a behavioral congruence loss term (\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{task}}) alongside adversarial and contrastive losses for representational alignment. 2) Specifically applying this combined framework to the challenging problem of aligning representations across highly disparate biological (fMRI, EEG) and artificial (CNN, Transformer) domains. 3) Focusing on learning *invariant* feature spaces as a primary goal to understand conserved principles. 4) Proposing intervention tools (neuro-guided fine-tuning) based on the learned alignment. This synthesis and application focus distinguishes it clearly from the cited prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in well-established machine learning techniques (adversarial learning, contrastive learning, CCA, Procrustes). The proposed hybrid loss function is theoretically plausible, aiming to balance domain invariance, class separability, and behavioral consistency. The mathematical formulations provided for the main loss components are standard and appear correct. The evaluation plan includes appropriate quantitative metrics and relevant baselines from the literature. Minor weaknesses include the potential difficulty in optimizing a complex loss function with three weighted terms, the simplification inherent in the proposed behavioral predictor b(\\cdot), and the known challenges associated with pseudo-labeling quality in unsupervised settings. The mechanism for 'neuro-guided loss' intervention lacks methodological detail, making its soundness harder to fully assess at this stage."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The required computational techniques (deep learning, adversarial/contrastive training) are standard. The main challenges relate to data acquisition, specifically obtaining high-quality, paired biological (e.g., fMRI) and behavioral data synchronized with stimuli presented to AI models. While such datasets exist, they can be difficult or costly to acquire. The optimization of the three-part loss function might require significant tuning. Pseudo-labeling for unsupervised scenarios adds another layer of complexity and potential variability. However, these are common research challenges rather than fundamental impossibilities, making the project generally realistic, albeit potentially resource-intensive in terms of data and tuning effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science â€“ understanding and aligning representations across different intelligent systems. Success would lead to major advancements: 1) Theoretically, by potentially uncovering universal computational principles through invariant features. 2) Technically, by providing a more robust, domain-agnostic framework for representational comparison and tools for intervention. 3) Applied, by impacting areas like human-AI collaboration, explainable AI, and neuroscience-informed AI design, with potential uses in fields like healthcare. The research directly tackles the central themes and questions outlined in the workshop task description, positioning it to make substantial contributions."
