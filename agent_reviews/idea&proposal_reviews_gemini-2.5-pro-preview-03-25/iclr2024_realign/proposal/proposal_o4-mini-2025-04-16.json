    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem outlined in the task (comparing bio/AI representations, limitations of current metrics, need for generalizable methods, intervention). The methodology faithfully implements the research idea (invariant space via dual-encoder, adversarial+contrastive learning). It explicitly references the challenges identified in the literature review (modality differences, false negatives, etc.) and positions the proposed work as a solution building upon those findings. All sections consistently contribute to the central theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and easy to understand. The methodology section provides a detailed overview of the DEIFS architecture, including specific components (encoders, discriminator) and loss functions with mathematical formulations. The training algorithm and experimental design (datasets, baselines, metrics) are clearly outlined. The structure is logical, and the language is precise. Minor implementation details (e.g., exact negative sampling filter) could be elaborated, but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While it utilizes existing machine learning techniques (adversarial domain adaptation, contrastive learning), it applies them in a novel combination (DEIFS framework) to address the specific and challenging problem of aligning representations across highly disparate domains (biological neural data vs. artificial network activations). This approach of learning an invariant feature space explicitly for bio-AI comparison, aiming to surpass limitations of direct comparison metrics like RSA/CKA, represents a fresh perspective. The combination of adversarial and contrastive objectives for this specific cross-modal alignment task is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in well-established machine learning principles (domain adaptation, contrastive learning). The proposed DEIFS architecture with dual encoders and combined adversarial/contrastive losses is technically well-founded for the goal of learning a domain-invariant space. The mathematical formulations for the loss functions are standard and correctly presented. The experimental plan is robust, including appropriate datasets, standard baselines for comparison, relevant evaluation metrics (including behavioral congruence), and planned ablation studies. The approach acknowledges potential challenges (e.g., false negatives) and suggests mitigation strategies."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required techniques (deep learning models, adversarial/contrastive training) are standard and implementable with current tools. The main challenges lie in acquiring well-matched, high-quality cross-domain datasets (e.g., neural recordings and model activations for the exact same stimuli) and potentially in the fine-tuning required to balance the adversarial and contrastive objectives effectively. Access to suitable computational resources is necessary. The 12-month timeline is ambitious but plausible for a dedicated effort, assuming data availability. Overall, the plan is realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI â€“ understanding and comparing representations across biological and artificial intelligence. Developing a robust, domain-agnostic alignment metric would be a major contribution, overcoming limitations of current methods. The potential impact is substantial: advancing fundamental understanding of computation, providing new tools for neuroscientists, enabling neurally-guided AI development, and potentially contributing to more interpretable and aligned AI systems. The research directly tackles key questions posed by the workshop."
