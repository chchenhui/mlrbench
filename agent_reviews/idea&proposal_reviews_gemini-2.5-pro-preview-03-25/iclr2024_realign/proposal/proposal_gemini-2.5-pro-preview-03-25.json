    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the Re-Align workshop description: developing robust, generalizable alignment measures across different domains (biological vs. artificial). The objectives precisely reflect the research idea of using domain-invariant spaces learned via DA techniques. The methodology leverages the specific contrastive-adversarial approaches highlighted in the literature review and explicitly aims to tackle the challenges identified therein (modality differences, lack of labels, etc.). The significance section clearly links the proposed work back to the key questions posed by the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, problem statement, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely and logically. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the proposed framework, including the conceptual basis, algorithmic approach (with loss functions), data requirements, experimental design, and validation strategy. Key terms are defined, and the overall structure makes the proposal easy to understand. Minor ambiguities typical of proposals (e.g., exact network architectures) exist but do not detract from the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While domain adaptation (DA) techniques and alignment metrics (CKA, RSA) exist independently, the core novelty lies in the specific application of advanced DA methods (hybrid contrastive-adversarial) to learn domain-invariant latent spaces *explicitly for the purpose of measuring representational alignment* between highly disparate systems like brains and ANNs. This differs significantly from standard DA applications (task transfer) and standard alignment approaches (direct comparison or simple transformations). The idea of validating alignment in this space via behavioral congruence and using it for intervention further enhances the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in representational similarity analysis and domain adaptation, citing relevant recent literature. The proposed hybrid contrastive-adversarial methodology is well-justified, combining techniques known to address different aspects of domain shift. The use of CKA in the learned latent space is appropriate. Technical formulations for the loss functions are correctly presented. The experimental plan includes necessary baselines, ablation studies, and a crucial validation step linking alignment to behavior. Minor weaknesses include the inherent assumption that such an invariant space is learnable and meaningful across highly diverse modalities (which is the core research question) and the somewhat high-level description of handling specific issues like false negatives ('explore techniques')."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. It leverages publicly available datasets and standard pre-trained models. The core ML techniques (contrastive learning, adversarial training) are well-established, although combining them effectively requires expertise. The main challenges are the need for significant computational resources (GPUs) for training and hyperparameter optimization, and the inherent research risk regarding whether the method will successfully learn a functionally meaningful invariant space. The scope is ambitious, potentially requiring staged implementation, but the overall plan is realistic for a well-resourced research group."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical, recognized bottleneck in cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI: comparing representations across fundamentally different systems. Success would provide a major methodological advancement for the field, directly answering key questions from the Re-Align workshop about robust cross-domain alignment metrics and shared computational strategies. The potential to link representational alignment to behavioral congruence and enable systematic intervention on alignment could yield substantial scientific insights and have downstream implications for AI interpretability, BCI design, and value alignment."
