    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Paths Forward' topic from the workshop call, focusing on the unique challenges of extending compositional learning to continual learning environments. The proposal meticulously elaborates on the core research idea (Dynamic Component Adaptation), detailing the three key capabilities outlined. Furthermore, it effectively integrates the cited literature, particularly the recent drift detection papers (Wan et al., 2024; Greco et al., 2024), proposing to adapt these methods as suggested. The research objectives and methodology directly tackle the key challenges identified in the literature review section (dynamic adaptation, drift detection, incremental learning, adaptive composition, evaluation). There are no discernible inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, problem statement, research idea (DCA-CCL), and objectives are articulated concisely and without ambiguity. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the framework, data generation strategy, specific techniques for drift detection, incremental learning, and adaptive composition, including relevant technical details and formulations (e.g., MMD, EWC loss). The experimental design is thorough and easy to understand. The structure is logical, flowing smoothly from introduction to expected outcomes. Minor ambiguities inherent in a proposal-stage description of complex methods do not detract significantly from the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it builds upon existing concepts in continual learning (EWC, replay) and concept drift detection (MCD-DD, DriftLens), its core novelty lies in the specific focus on *adapting the compositional building blocks (components) and their combination rules* within a continual learning setting. This contrasts with standard CL applied monolithically or standard compositional learning assuming static components. Proposing composition-aware drift detection operating on intermediate representations and adaptive composition mechanisms tailored to evolving relationships is a fresh perspective. The integration of these elements into the unified DCA-CCL framework represents a significant conceptual advance over prior work, clearly distinguishing itself, even if not entirely groundbreaking in its base techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established principles of compositional learning, continual learning, and concept drift detection. The proposed methodology leverages recognized techniques (MMD, contrastive learning, EWC, generative replay, attention mechanisms) and adapts them logically to the problem domain. The technical formulations provided are correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring appropriate benchmarks (though requiring creation), strong baselines, relevant metrics, and planned ablation studies, ensuring rigorous evaluation. Potential challenges in adapting methods (e.g., drift detection on intermediate representations, balancing plasticity/stability) are acknowledged implicitly by the research plan, but the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, but presents notable implementation challenges. The required techniques (deep learning models, CL algorithms, drift detection) are available, and computational resources are standard for ML research. Creating the proposed synthetic/semi-synthetic benchmarks (C-MNIST-Seq, C-CLEVR-Seq) is achievable but requires significant effort. The main challenge lies in the complexity of integrating the three core components (drift detection, incremental learning, adaptive composition) into a robust, unified framework and effectively tuning the interactions between them. Adapting existing methods to the specific compositional context also carries research risk. The scope is ambitious, suggesting a multi-year effort, but the plan is generally realistic with manageable risks for a dedicated research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely gap at the intersection of compositional learning and continual learning â€“ enabling AI to adapt its compositional understanding in dynamic environments. This is crucial for real-world AI robustness. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially leading to more capable systems in robotics, autonomous systems, and dialogue. It directly contributes to the workshop's themes and could inform the development of more adaptable foundation models. The creation of new benchmarks would also be a valuable contribution to the community. The potential impact on both theory and practice is substantial."
