        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the third focus area of the workshop ('does such modularity in structures guarantee compositional generalization and is there any correspondence between them?') by proposing a systematic investigation into modular adapter structures and their link to compositional generalization in foundation models. It explicitly mentions modular learning approaches (adapters) and aims for both empirical and theoretical contributions, matching the workshop's call precisely."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem (poor compositional generalization in foundation models and the unclear role of modularity). The main idea outlines a specific plan: develop a taxonomy of adapter architectures, evaluate them on compositional benchmarks, and produce empirical evidence, a theoretical framework, and design principles. The objectives and methodology are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While research exists on both adapters and compositional generalization separately, the proposed systematic investigation focusing specifically on the *correlation* between *different types* of adapter modularity (via a taxonomy) and *different types* of compositional generalization is innovative. Developing a dedicated theoretical framework and practical design principles specifically for 'compositional adapters' based on this systematic study offers a fresh perspective beyond simply applying existing adapters."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Developing a taxonomy and implementing various adapter architectures is practical. Evaluating them requires access to foundation models, significant computational resources, and carefully designed or selected compositional generalization benchmarks (which might need adaptation). Developing a comprehensive theoretical framework explaining the link could be complex, though deriving empirical insights and initial theoretical explanations is achievable. Overall, it's feasible with adequate resources and expertise, but requires considerable effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Improving compositional generalization is a critical challenge for current foundation models, limiting their robustness and reliability on out-of-distribution tasks. Understanding how modular structures like adapters influence this capability could lead to major advancements. The potential outputs – empirical evidence, theoretical understanding, and practical design principles for 'compositional adapters' – could provide concrete ways to enhance foundation models' generalization abilities in a parameter-efficient manner, which is highly valuable."
