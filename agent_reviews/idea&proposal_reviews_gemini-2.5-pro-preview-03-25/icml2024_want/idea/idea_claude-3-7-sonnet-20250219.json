    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's theme of computational efficiency, scalability, and resource optimization in neural network training. It directly addresses several listed topics, including 'Efficient computations: low-precision computations', 'Energy-efficient training', and implicitly 'Training for large scale models' by reducing resource requirements. The motivation explicitly mentions democratizing access for resource-constrained researchers, aligning with the workshop's goal of enabling progress for smaller teams."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-articulated. The motivation clearly defines the problem (high cost of training, limitations of fixed precision). The main idea (dynamic quantization via sensitivity analysis, RL control, and hardware awareness) is explained concisely. The three key components are distinct and understandable at a conceptual level. While implementation details (specific metrics, RL state/action/reward space) are omitted, this is expected for a research idea summary. The overall objective and proposed approach are unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While low-precision training and adaptive precision are existing areas, this idea introduces notable originality. The novelty lies in the specific combination and approach: using an RL controller to dynamically learn optimal, layer-specific quantization policies throughout training, explicitly optimizing a complex objective (stability, memory, computation), informed by real-time gradient-based sensitivity analysis and hardware constraints. This sophisticated, learning-based control mechanism for dynamic precision appears significantly different from static policies or simpler adaptive heuristics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents significant engineering challenges. Gradient statistics can be monitored, RL controllers can be trained, and hardware performance can be modeled. However, integrating these components effectively is complex. Potential challenges include the computational overhead of the sensitivity analysis and RL agent (which must be less than the savings), ensuring training stability despite dynamically changing precision, and the complexity of designing a robust RL framework (reward shaping, state representation) that generalizes across models and tasks. The mention of preliminary results suggests initial viability, but robust implementation requires considerable effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it addresses the critical problem of escalating computational and energy costs associated with training large neural networks. If successful, achieving substantial reductions in memory (claimed 70%) and energy (claimed 50%) with minimal impact on model quality would represent a major advancement. This could lower the barrier for large-scale AI research, enable training on less powerful hardware, accelerate development cycles, and contribute significantly to more sustainable AI practices."
