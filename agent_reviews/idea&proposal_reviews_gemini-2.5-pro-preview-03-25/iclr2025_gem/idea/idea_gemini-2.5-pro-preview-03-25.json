        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core goal of bridging the gap between generative ML and experimental biology by proposing an integrated system where ML guides wet lab experiments for antibody design. It explicitly fits into the 'Biology track' by proposing the 'employment of ML for biomolecular design with wet lab experimental results' and incorporates 'Adaptive experimental design', a listed topic. The motivation and proposed method directly tackle the disconnect between *in silico* performance and real-world application highlighted in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (cost/inefficiency of experimental validation), the main components (generative model, active learning, experimental feedback), the iterative process (generate -> select -> test -> feedback -> refine), and the overall goal (optimized affinity maturation). Examples of potential models and experimental techniques are provided. The concept of a closed-loop system is immediately understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific choice of acquisition function or predictive model, but this is acceptable for a research idea proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While generative models for proteins and active learning are established fields, their tight integration into a closed-loop system specifically for iterative antibody affinity maturation, where experimental results directly fine-tune the models to guide subsequent experiments, is a current and innovative research direction. It's not proposing a fundamentally new ML algorithm but rather a novel and impactful application framework combining existing techniques to solve a specific, challenging biological problem. This integration addresses a key bottleneck in the field."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The required components (generative protein models like ProteinMPNN/ESM-IF, active learning frameworks, standard experimental assays like yeast display/SPR) exist. However, successful execution requires significant resources, including access to a well-equipped wet lab and expertise in both computational modeling and experimental antibody engineering. Integrating the computational and experimental workflows smoothly and managing the iterative cycles efficiently are non-trivial. Fine-tuning models based on potentially small batches of experimental data also needs careful consideration. It's feasible within a dedicated research setting but requires substantial effort and interdisciplinary collaboration."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Antibody affinity maturation is a critical step in developing effective therapeutics, and current experimental approaches are often laborious and expensive. By proposing a method to make this process more efficient and targeted using ML-guided experimentation, the research directly addresses a major bottleneck in drug discovery. Success would lead to faster development of potent antibodies, potentially accelerating the availability of new treatments, representing a major advancement in applying ML to real-world biomedical challenges."
