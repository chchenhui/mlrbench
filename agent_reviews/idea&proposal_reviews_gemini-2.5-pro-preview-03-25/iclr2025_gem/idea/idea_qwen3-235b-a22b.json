    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of bridging the gap between generative ML and experimental biology. Furthermore, 'Adaptive experimental design' is explicitly listed as a topic of interest under the workshop's Biology track, which requires wet lab experimental results – something the proposed iterative feedback loop and high-throughput validation inherently imply. The idea focuses on integrating ML (GP model) with experimental validation to improve efficiency, matching the workshop's goal precisely."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, core components (Active Learning, Gaussian Process, iterative feedback), specific techniques (tailored kernels, potential GNNs), validation method (high-throughput screening), and expected outcomes (reduced experiments, novel biomolecules) are articulated concisely and logically. The overall pipeline is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. While active learning and Gaussian Processes are established techniques, and their application to optimize experiments isn't entirely new across all scientific fields, their specific, integrated application within a framework tailored for high-dimensional biomolecular data (potentially using advanced kernels or GNN representations) and linked directly to high-throughput screening offers practical novelty. It combines existing concepts effectively for the specific challenge of biomolecular optimization, rather than introducing a fundamentally new ML paradigm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Gaussian Processes and active learning algorithms are well-established. High-throughput experimental capabilities exist, although access and integration pose practical challenges. The main technical hurdles involve developing effective kernels or representation learning methods (like GNNs) for high-dimensional biomolecular data suitable for GPs, and engineering the seamless iterative loop between computation and wet lab experiments. This requires significant interdisciplinary expertise and resources but is achievable with current technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in biomolecular design and drug discovery – the time and cost associated with experimental validation. By proposing a method to make experimentation more efficient and targeted, it could significantly accelerate the discovery of novel biomolecules with desired functions, impacting fields like medicine, biotechnology, and materials science. It directly tackles the ML-experimental integration problem highlighted by the workshop."
