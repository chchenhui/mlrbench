        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The GEM workshop explicitly aims to bridge the gap between generative ML and experimental biology, and this idea directly addresses that by focusing on interpretability to make ML models for protein design more useful and trustworthy for experimentalists. It fits squarely into the ML track's topic of 'Model interpretability' and also relates to 'Inverse design' and 'Modelling biomolecular data'. The emphasis on feedback loops and enabling experimental validation strongly resonates with the workshop's core mission."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem (black-box models hindering experimental use). The proposed solution (multi-scale interpretability framework with sequence, structure, and function levels) is well-articulated, mentioning specific approaches (attention, explainable GNNs) and key features (interactive interface, feedback loop, uncertainty modeling). The goals are explicit and logical. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While interpretability techniques like attention and GNN explainability exist, applying them in an integrated, multi-scale (sequence, structure, function) manner specifically for protein design is innovative. The inclusion of an interactive interface tailored for experimentalist feedback and iteration, combined with uncertainty modeling within this interpretable framework, represents a fresh and valuable approach that goes beyond standard interpretability applications in the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core machine learning components (attention mechanisms, GNNs, existing explainability methods) are established technologies. Data for protein sequences, structures, and functions are available. However, integrating these diverse components into a cohesive multi-scale framework, developing a robust interactive interface, and effectively incorporating experimental feedback loops present moderate implementation challenges. It requires significant expertise and engineering effort but is achievable with current technology and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the field: the lack of interpretability in deep learning models for protein design, which hinders their practical application and validation by experimentalists. Successfully implementing this framework could significantly accelerate the design-test-learn cycle in protein engineering, reduce experimental costs, increase the success rate of computationally designed proteins, and foster closer collaboration between computational and experimental researchers, directly contributing to the goals highlighted by the GEM workshop."
