    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (GEM workshop's goal of bridging ML and experimental biology), the research idea (iterative generative design loop with active learning), and the literature review (addressing key challenges like experimental integration). It directly tackles the workshop's theme by proposing a method that integrates generative ML with wet-lab validation through active learning, fitting well within the scope of both ML and Biology tracks (particularly 'Adaptive experimental design'). The methodology clearly operationalizes the research idea, and the significance statement echoes the workshop's motivation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology components (generative model, active learning, predictive model, wet-lab, iteration), and overall workflow are presented logically and are easy to understand. The significance and rationale are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the specific details of the acquisition function or the exact nature/source of the training data for the predictive model, but these are acceptable for a proposal stage. The structure is logical and facilitates understanding."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the application of generative models and active learning to antibody design is highly relevant, the core concept of integrating these components in a closed loop with experimental feedback is present in several recent papers cited in the literature review (e.g., Gessner et al. 2024, Amin et al. 2024, Filella-Merce et al. 2023). The proposal combines state-of-the-art techniques effectively but doesn't strongly articulate a unique methodological innovation beyond applying this established framework to antibody affinity maturation. The novelty lies more in the specific implementation and integration rather than a fundamentally new concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (generative modeling, active learning) and established experimental techniques (yeast display, SPR). The proposed methodology, involving an iterative loop of generation, prediction, selection, testing, and refinement, is logical and well-justified for improving efficiency. Using state-of-the-art models (ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF) is appropriate. The approach is well-supported by the recent literature. While technical details like the specific acquisition function or model update mechanisms are not fully elaborated, the overall approach is robust and scientifically plausible."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents challenges. The required computational methods (generative models, active learning) and experimental techniques (yeast display, SPR) are available. However, successful execution requires significant resources: computational power, specialized wet-lab facilities and expertise, and potentially substantial time for experimental iterations. Access to initial training data (antibody sequences, binding affinities) could be a bottleneck. Close collaboration between ML researchers and experimental biologists is crucial but achievable. The risks associated with experimental cost/time and data quality are manageable but require careful planning."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Antibody affinity maturation is a critical step in therapeutic development, and improving its efficiency addresses a major bottleneck. By bridging *in silico* design and wet-lab validation using active learning, the research has the potential to substantially accelerate the discovery of potent antibodies, reducing costs and timelines. This aligns perfectly with the goal of translating ML advancements into real-world biological applications, as emphasized by the GEM workshop. Success would represent a meaningful contribution to antibody engineering and potentially other biomolecular design fields."
