        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging generative ML and experimental biology by proposing a closed-loop system involving both computational modeling and wet-lab validation. It perfectly embodies the provided research idea, detailing the integration of generative models, active learning, and experimental feedback for antibody affinity maturation. Furthermore, it appropriately situates the work within the context of recent literature (citing relevant papers on active learning, Bayesian optimization, and generative models for antibodies like CloneBO, which is included as a baseline) and acknowledges key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. Objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology is detailed step-by-step, including specific model architectures (ProteinMPNN/ESM-IF, ESM embeddings), mathematical formulations for loss functions and the acquisition function (UCB), uncertainty estimation methods, and a precise algorithmic representation of the iterative loop (IGAL). Hyperparameters, validation strategy, and evaluation metrics are clearly specified. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving minimal room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the core concepts of using generative models for sequence design and active learning for experiment guidance exist in the literature (as evidenced by the provided review, e.g., Gessner et al., Amin et al., Filella-Merce et al.), the specific integration proposed in the IGAL framework is innovative. This includes the combination of fine-tuning specific pre-trained generative models (ProteinMPNN/ESM-IF) conditioned on a parent sequence, using a specific affinity-weighted fine-tuning objective for the generator, coupling it with an ESM-based predictor with uncertainty quantification, and implementing this within a defined closed-loop algorithm. The planned comparison against relevant recent baselines like CloneBO also adds value. It's a strong synthesis and refinement rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (generative models, protein LMs, active learning principles like UCB) and established methods (fine-tuning, MC dropout/ensembles for uncertainty). The methodology is well-described, technically detailed, and includes appropriate mathematical formulations. The validation plan with baselines and clear metrics is robust. Minor potential challenges exist, such as the sensitivity of the generator's weighted loss function to the hyperparameter alpha and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for UCB, but the overall approach is technically well-founded and justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing, albeit advanced, resources: specific ML models (ProteinMPNN, ESM) and standard experimental techniques (yeast display, SPR). The proposed scale (5 rounds, 50 samples/round) is realistic for a research project, assuming access to the required computational (A100 GPUs) and wet-lab (yeast display, Biacore) infrastructure and expertise. The plan is well-defined. Potential risks involve experimental failures (expression, measurement noise) and model convergence issues, but these are inherent to such ML-experimental loops and seem manageable within the proposed scope."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical bottleneck in therapeutic antibody development â€“ the time and cost associated with affinity maturation. By aiming to drastically reduce the number of required wet-lab experiments through intelligent guidance from ML, the project has the potential for major impact on pharmaceutical R&D efficiency. Success would represent a significant advancement in applying integrated ML-experimental approaches to biomolecular design. The potential extensibility to other biomolecules and the commitment to open-source release further enhance its significance and potential impact on the broader scientific community."
