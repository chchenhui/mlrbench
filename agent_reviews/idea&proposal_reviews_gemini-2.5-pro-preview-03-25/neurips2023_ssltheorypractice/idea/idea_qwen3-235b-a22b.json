        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on 'Theoretical foundations of SSL' and 'Sample complexity of SSL methods'. The idea directly addresses the key question posed in the task description: 'How many unlabeled data examples are needed by SSL to learn a good representation?'. It aims to bridge theory (data geometry, learning theory bounds) and practice (empirical validation, guiding data collection) which is the central theme of the workshop."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem (lack of understanding of SSL data requirements). The main idea outlines a specific approach (using data geometry via learning theory and TDA) and concrete steps (characterize geometry, derive bounds, validate empirically). The expected outcomes are specific and logical. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While sample complexity in SSL is studied, the specific approach of using data geometry, particularly leveraging tools like topological data analysis (TDA) to characterize structure and derive bounds, offers a fresh perspective. Connecting geometric properties of the unlabeled data manifold directly to the sample efficiency of SSL auxiliary tasks is an innovative angle compared to more common information-theoretic or optimization-focused analyses."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Deriving tight theoretical bounds that link complex geometric properties (especially those captured by TDA in high dimensions) to the sample complexity of modern deep SSL models is notoriously difficult. Characterizing the relevant geometry of high-dimensional data spaces (images, text embeddings) is computationally intensive and methodologically challenging. While the empirical validation part is standard, the core theoretical contribution requires overcoming substantial technical hurdles. Success might depend on strong simplifying assumptions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the sample complexity of SSL is a fundamental problem with major practical implications, especially for optimizing data acquisition in resource-constrained domains (healthcare, robotics, low-resource NLP). Providing theoretical grounding and practical metrics for data requirements would be a major advancement, guiding experimental design and resource allocation. Successfully linking data geometry to sample efficiency would offer deep insights into the mechanisms underlying SSL."
