        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions on 'Theoretical foundations of SSL' and 'Sample complexity of SSL methods', which are the core focus of this proposal. It also aims to bridge the theory-practice gap by deriving bounds and providing practical guidelines, directly addressing the workshop's central theme. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of contrastive vs. non-contrastive methods fits well within the scope of 'Comparative analysis of different auxiliary tasks', and the plan to validate across multiple modalities (vision, language, time-series) aligns with the task's broad interest in SSL applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation explicitly states the problem (lack of theoretical understanding of sample complexity). The main idea clearly outlines the objective (derive sample complexity bounds), the methods to be compared (contrastive vs. non-contrastive, e.g., SimCLR vs. DINO/BYOL), the theoretical approach (statistical learning theory), the factors to consider (augmentation, architecture, latent space), the validation strategy (controlled experiments across modalities), and the expected outcomes (theoretical bounds, practical guidelines). The scope and goals are unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While theoretical analysis of SSL and sample complexity exists, this proposal focuses specifically on deriving *comparative* sample complexity bounds for the two dominant paradigms (contrastive vs. non-contrastive). Directly comparing these classes theoretically, considering factors like augmentation strength and architecture, offers a fresh perspective beyond empirical benchmarks. It applies existing theoretical tools (statistical learning theory) to a specific, important, and relatively under-explored comparative question within SSL, rather than proposing entirely new theoretical machinery."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant theoretical challenges. Deriving tight and meaningful sample complexity bounds for deep neural networks, especially complex SSL frameworks like DINO or BYOL, is notoriously difficult and often requires strong assumptions. While leveraging statistical learning theory is standard, the successful derivation of insightful bounds is not guaranteed. The experimental validation component, however, is highly feasible using standard datasets and computational resources. The overall feasibility hinges on the tractability of the theoretical analysis, making it good but challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the sample complexity of different SSL approaches is a critical theoretical question with substantial practical implications, particularly for deploying SSL effectively in data-limited scenarios. Providing theoretically grounded guidelines for choosing between contrastive and non-contrastive methods would be extremely valuable for practitioners. This work directly addresses the theory-practice gap highlighted in the task description and could lead to more efficient use of SSL and potentially inspire new algorithm designs focused on sample efficiency."
