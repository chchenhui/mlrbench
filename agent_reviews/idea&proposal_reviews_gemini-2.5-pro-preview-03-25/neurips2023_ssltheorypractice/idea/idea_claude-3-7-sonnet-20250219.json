        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop call for papers). It directly addresses multiple key topics listed, including 'Theoretical foundations of SSL', 'Theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks in SSL', 'Comparative analysis of different auxiliary tasks', 'Information theory and SSL', and implicitly 'Sample complexity of SSL methods'. The idea's goal to bridge the gap between theory and practice by developing a framework that yields practical guidelines resonates strongly with the workshop's central theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (lack of theoretical understanding for auxiliary task design) is explicitly stated. The main proposal (a theoretical framework based on information theory, the 'task alignment spectrum' concept, modeling relationships, deriving bounds, empirical validation, practical guidelines) is articulated concisely and logically. While the exact mathematical formulation of the 'task alignment spectrum' isn't detailed, the overall concept and research plan are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While information theory has been applied to understand aspects of SSL (e.g., the information bottleneck principle, connections between contrastive loss and mutual information), proposing a comprehensive framework specifically for *characterizing, comparing, and guiding the design* of diverse auxiliary tasks based on their information-theoretic alignment with downstream tasks is innovative. The concept of a 'task alignment spectrum' as a quantitative measure appears novel. It moves beyond analyzing existing methods towards a more principled, predictive, and design-oriented theoretical approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant challenges. Theoretically, deriving rigorous and tight bounds relating information-theoretic quantities (like mutual information) to representation quality and sample complexity for complex deep learning models is notoriously difficult. Practically, estimating mutual information accurately in high-dimensional spaces (like representations from deep networks) is challenging. Furthermore, comprehensive empirical validation across multiple domains (vision, language, graphs) requires substantial computational resources and careful experimental design. While conceptually sound, the practical execution faces non-trivial hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and widely recognized gap in SSL: the lack of a principled understanding of why certain auxiliary tasks work better than others and how to design optimal ones. A successful framework could provide crucial theoretical insights, lead to more systematic and efficient design of SSL methods, reduce reliance on empirical trial-and-error, potentially lower computational costs, and accelerate progress in representation learning across various domains. Its potential to bridge theory and practice is substantial."
