        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging the gap between SSL theory and practice by proposing a method that uses theoretical insights (sample complexity proxies) to improve practical SSL performance (task scheduling). It explicitly targets key topics mentioned in the call, such as 'Theoretical foundations of SSL', 'Sample complexity of SSL methods', and 'Theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks in SSL'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is very clear and well-defined. The motivation, main components (deriving proxies, designing controller, implementation/validation), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely. It specifies the types of proxies (mutual information, spectral properties), target frameworks (SimCLR, MAE, BERT), and domains (vision, language). Minor ambiguities might exist in the precise mathematical formulation of the 'lightweight proxies' or the exact dynamics of the controller, but the overall research direction and methodology are excellently communicated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While curriculum learning and SSL are established fields, the core novelty lies in using theoretically derived proxies for sample complexity (based on mutual information/spectral properties) to dynamically guide the curriculum of auxiliary tasks in SSL. This contrasts with more heuristic or fixed approaches to task scheduling or combination in SSL, offering a fresh, theory-grounded perspective."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents technical challenges. Implementing the curriculum controller and integrating it with standard SSL frameworks is practical. The main challenge lies in deriving 'lightweight' yet accurate proxies for the sample complexity of diverse SSL tasks. Estimating mutual information and spectral properties can be complex and computationally demanding. Success hinges on developing effective approximations or methods to make these estimations tractable during training. Standard compute resources for SSL training would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. It addresses critical challenges in SSL: the reliance on massive unlabeled data, extensive tuning, and the often ad-hoc selection of auxiliary tasks. By proposing a principled, theory-guided approach to task scheduling, it could lead to substantial improvements in data efficiency, faster convergence (estimated 20-30% fewer epochs), and potentially better representation quality (+2-5% accuracy). Success would represent a major advancement in making SSL more efficient and robust, directly contributing to the field's theoretical understanding and practical application."
