        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of bridging theory and practice in SSL, focusing explicitly on sample complexity â€“ a key topic mentioned in the task description and identified as a challenge in the literature review. The objectives, methodology (comparing contrastive vs. non-contrastive methods theoretically and empirically across modalities), and expected outcomes directly reflect the research idea and aim to answer questions posed in the task description (e.g., 'How many unlabeled data examples are needed?'). It incorporates insights and challenges from the provided literature (e.g., building on generalization bounds, exploring paradigm differences, considering design choices)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and logically presented. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and precisely. The problem formalization, theoretical frameworks (Rademacher complexity, spectral analysis), experimental design (datasets, models, metrics, validation), and expected contributions (theoretical bounds, practical guidelines, SampleBoost algorithm) are clearly defined. Minor ambiguities inherent in a proposal (e.g., exact steps of theoretical derivations, precise definitions of 'alpha' or 'sep' without full context) are acceptable and do not detract significantly from the overall clarity. The structure is easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While research exists on generalization bounds (Hieu et al.) and theoretical links between SSL paradigms (Garrido et al., Balestriero & LeCun), this proposal focuses specifically on deriving *comparative sample complexity bounds* for contrastive vs. non-contrastive methods, explicitly modeling the influence of factors like augmentation strength, negative samples (K), and latent geometry (sep). This specific focus on comparative sample complexity and its drivers appears novel and directly addresses a key challenge identified in the literature. The systematic empirical validation across multiple modalities and the proposal of a new algorithm (SampleBoost) based on the findings further enhance the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (statistical learning theory, spectral manifold learning) and cites relevant prior work. The proposed methodology, including the use of Rademacher complexity for contrastive methods and spectral analysis for non-contrastive ones, is theoretically plausible. The experimental design is rigorous, involving controlled variation, multiple modalities, standard benchmarks, and a clear plan for validating theory. The technical formulations (loss functions, sketched bounds) are appropriate for a proposal. The main challenge, acknowledged implicitly, is the difficulty of deriving tight bounds for deep networks, which might require simplifying assumptions, but the overall approach is well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The experimental component uses standard datasets, well-known SSL algorithms, and established evaluation protocols, making it implementable with adequate computational resources (which are significant but typical for SSL research). The theoretical component is more challenging, as deriving tight bounds is complex, but it relies on established mathematical tools and seems achievable by experts in the field, potentially with some simplifying assumptions. The overall plan is realistic, with manageable risks primarily related to the difficulty of the theoretical derivations and the need for substantial compute power."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and poorly understood question in SSL: the sample complexity of different approaches. Understanding data requirements is crucial for the efficient and effective deployment of SSL, especially in data-scarce domains (healthcare, specific sciences). By providing theoretical bounds, empirical validation across modalities, and practical guidelines, the research has the potential to significantly advance the field, guide practitioners, democratize SSL adoption, and inspire new, more sample-efficient algorithms. It directly contributes to bridging the theory-practice gap highlighted in the task description."
