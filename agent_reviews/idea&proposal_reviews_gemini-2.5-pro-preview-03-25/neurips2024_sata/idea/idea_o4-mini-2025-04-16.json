    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses the core theme of the workshop ('Safe & Trustworthy Agents') and aligns perfectly with the first listed topic: 'Research into safe reasoning and memory. We are interested in work that makes LLM agent reasoning or memory trustworthy, e.g., by preventing hallucinations or mitigating bias.' VeriMem explicitly aims to enhance memory trustworthiness by reducing hallucinations and mitigating bias through a veracity-scoring mechanism, making it exceptionally relevant to the task description."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (hallucination/bias in agent memory), the core mechanism (veracity scores, fact-checking, dynamic thresholds, uncertainty estimation), the proposed implementation context (ReAct loop), and the evaluation plan (tasks, metrics) are all articulated concisely and understandably. While specific implementation details like 'lightweight fact-checking' or 'dynamic threshold' require further research, the overall concept and approach are unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like fact-checking, memory augmentation, and uncertainty estimation exist individually, VeriMem proposes a novel integration: embedding a dynamic veracity score directly within the agent's persistent memory architecture, continuously updated and used to filter/validate recalls. This focus on managing the trustworthiness of the agent's *internal* long-term memory over time, rather than just augmenting generation with external facts (like standard RAG), offers a fresh perspective on agent reliability. It's a new combination and application of existing ideas tailored specifically for agent memory safety."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology. It relies on existing components like LLMs, memory modules, knowledge bases/APIs for fact-checking, and agent frameworks (ReAct). Key challenges include optimizing the 'lightweight' fact-checking process for efficiency, designing effective dynamic veracity thresholds, and integrating the system without introducing prohibitive latency. However, these seem like solvable engineering and research problems rather than fundamental roadblocks. Standard ML resources should suffice."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing hallucinations and bias propagation in LLM agent memory is critical for building trust and enabling safe deployment, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, as mentioned in the motivation. Improving the reliability of agent memory is a key challenge in the field. A successful VeriMem system could lead to major advancements in agent trustworthiness and safety, making it a highly important research direction."
