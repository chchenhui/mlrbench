        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for 'Research into safe reasoning and memory' aiming to make LLM agent memory trustworthy and prevent hallucinations. This idea directly proposes a 'Truth-Guided Memory (TGM)' architecture specifically designed to address these issues (hallucinations, memory corruption, factual consistency) in LLM agents, fitting squarely within the primary topic of interest."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (hallucinations, memory corruption in agents), outlines the main components of the proposed TGM architecture (Factual Verification Layer, Confidence Scoring Mechanism, Memory Rectification Protocol, doubt token), and specifies the evaluation approach (new benchmark, memory drift metrics). The goal of creating trustworthy agents that are aware of their uncertainty is explicitly mentioned. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like factual verification (similar to RAG), confidence scoring, and memory editing exist in LLM research, the novelty lies in their specific integration into a cohesive three-tiered architecture explicitly designed for agent memory safety and long-term consistency. The concepts of a dedicated Memory Rectification Protocol triggered by contradictory evidence and an explicit 'doubt token' for memory uncertainty within an agent framework offer fresh perspectives. The proposal to develop a new benchmark focused on long-term factual consistency and 'memory drift' also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate challenges. Implementing the Factual Verification Layer requires access to a reliable and comprehensive trusted knowledge base, which can be a bottleneck depending on the domain. Developing robust Confidence Scoring Mechanisms for LLM outputs is an ongoing research challenge. Designing an effective Memory Rectification Protocol that correctly identifies and updates memories without introducing new errors is complex. Building the proposed new benchmark also requires significant effort. However, the components are based on active research areas, suggesting that implementation, while requiring refinement and careful engineering, is achievable within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck for the safe deployment of LLM agents: their tendency to hallucinate and maintain corrupted memory over time. Ensuring factual consistency and enabling agents to recognize their own uncertainty ('know when they don't know') are crucial for trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains mentioned (healthcare, finance). Success in this research could lead to major advancements in agent reliability and safety, fostering greater trust and enabling broader adoption of agentic AI systems."
