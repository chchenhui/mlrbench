    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'safe reasoning and memory', 'preventing hallucinations', and 'mitigating bias'. The methodology comprehensively expands on the core research idea, detailing the VeriMem architecture. It effectively synthesizes concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, positioning itself clearly within the existing research landscape (e.g., referencing A-MEM, Rowen, Sumers et al.) while tackling the core problem identified."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes) is logical. Objectives are explicitly stated. The VeriMem architecture, its components, and processes like veracity assessment and dynamic retrieval are described in detail, including mathematical formulations. The experimental design is well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise operationalization of some functions (e.g., `criticality(q)`, `self-eval(m, q)`, `f_uncertain`), but the overall concept and methodology are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the specific VeriMem architecture integrating veracity scores, dynamic fact-checking, uncertainty estimation, and external validation within a ReAct framework is presented as novel, the core underlying concepts appear significantly explored in the provided literature review (specifically papers 5-10: Doe et al., Brown et al., Lee et al., Thompson et al., Chen et al., Harris et al.). These papers cover veracity scoring, trustworthy memory, bias mitigation via veracity, fact-checking, and dynamic thresholds. The proposal's main contribution seems to be the specific system design and integration of these ideas, rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The distinction from this closely related prior work could be emphasized more strongly."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on the well-understood problem of LLM hallucinations and leverages established concepts like external knowledge validation and agent reasoning frameworks (ReAct). The methodology is logical, detailing components and processes with mathematical formulations. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and appropriate. However, some aspects could be strengthened: the justification for the specific weights and thresholds in the veracity formulas needs empirical backing, the definitions of some functions lack full technical detail, and the heavy reliance on the quality and coverage of external knowledge sources is a key assumption."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology (LLMs, vector DBs, APIs). The plan is generally realistic, outlining necessary components and evaluation steps. However, implementation presents moderate challenges: integrating multiple components requires significant engineering effort, the veracity assessment and external validation steps could introduce substantial computational overhead and latency impacting real-time use, and effective parameter tuning (\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, etc.) will be crucial and potentially time-consuming. Access to high-quality external knowledge sources and APIs is necessary."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and pervasive problem of hallucinations and untrustworthiness in LLM agents, a major bottleneck for their deployment in high-stakes, real-world applications (healthcare, finance, etc.). Successfully developing VeriMem could lead to major advancements in agent safety and reliability, potentially influencing future memory architecture design and enabling new applications. The research directly contributes to the core goals of trustworthy AI development."
