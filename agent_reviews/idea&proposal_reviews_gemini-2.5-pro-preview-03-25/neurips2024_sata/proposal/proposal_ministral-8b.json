    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description (Workshop on Safe & Trustworthy Agents, focusing on safe memory, hallucination prevention, and bias mitigation), the research idea (VeriMem concept for veracity-aware memory), and the literature review (acknowledging and building upon concepts like veracity scoring and fact-checking for LLM memory). It comprehensively addresses the requirements and demonstrates a clear understanding of the context and related work mentioned."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives, methodology steps, and rationale are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise calculation methods for S(M), F(M), and C in the mathematical formulation, and the specifics of the 'lightweight fact-checking' and 'uncertainty estimator' are not fully detailed, but the overall concept and plan are immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal's novelty is limited based on the provided literature review. Several cited papers (specifically 5, 7, 8, 9, 10) already propose core concepts like veracity scoring, periodic fact-checking, dynamic thresholds, and bias/hallucination mitigation for LLM memory. VeriMem appears to be a specific implementation and integration of these existing ideas (e.g., combining source credibility and fact-checking in a specific formula, integrating with ReAct) rather than introducing a fundamentally new approach. The novelty is incremental rather than groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is conceptually sound, leveraging established ideas like fact-checking and confidence scoring to improve memory reliability. The methodological steps are logical. However, the technical rigor is moderate. The mathematical formulations for veracity score and threshold are simple weighted averages and depend on components (S(M), F(M), C) whose calculation methods are not defined. Key mechanisms like 'lightweight fact-checking' and 'uncertainty estimator' lack sufficient detail to fully assess their robustness and effectiveness. More technical depth is needed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible. It relies on accessible technologies (LLMs, agent frameworks, external APIs/corpora) and standard experimental procedures. The plan is generally realistic. However, challenges highlighted in the literature review (efficient and reliable fact-checking, robust veracity scoring, balancing adaptability/trustworthiness, potential latency) are acknowledged implicitly but not explicitly addressed with detailed solutions in the proposal. Implementation is achievable but non-trivial, requiring careful engineering to ensure efficiency and effectiveness."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of trustworthiness (due to hallucinations and bias) in LLM agent memory. Improving memory reliability is critical for deploying agents in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, aligning perfectly with the workshop's theme. A successful VeriMem system would be a substantial contribution to making LLM agents safer and more dependable, potentially having a major impact on the field."
