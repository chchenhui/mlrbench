        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task focuses on Trustworthy ML for Healthcare, explicitly listing 'Uncertainty estimation of ML models' and 'Multi-modal fusion and learning' as key topics. The research idea directly addresses both by proposing a method for calibrated uncertainty quantification specifically for multi-modal medical data. The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of enhancing trust and confidence for clinical application."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (need for calibrated uncertainty in multi-modal diagnosis), the proposed methods (deep evidential learning + conformal prediction), the target application (multi-modal healthcare tasks like CT + EHR), and the expected outcome (prediction sets with coverage guarantees, improved reliability). The distinction between uncertainty sources and the role of each component (evidential learning for modeling, conformal prediction for calibration) is well-articulated. Minor implementation details are understandably omitted, but the core concept is unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While deep evidential learning and conformal prediction are existing techniques, their specific combination to calibrate uncertainty derived from evidential frameworks, particularly in the context of multi-modal medical diagnosis, offers a novel approach. Evidential learning provides a structured decomposition of uncertainty, and applying conformal prediction to these structured outputs (rather than standard model outputs) for rigorous calibration in this complex domain is innovative. It represents a thoughtful synthesis of recent techniques applied to a challenging problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Deep learning frameworks support evidential learning implementations, and conformal prediction algorithms are available. Multi-modal medical datasets exist, although access, preprocessing, and fusion can present challenges. The main technical hurdles involve effectively integrating evidential learning outputs with conformal prediction (defining appropriate non-conformity scores) and scaling the approach to potentially large and complex medical datasets. Requires significant expertise and computational resources, but no fundamental technological barriers make it impractical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Providing reliable and statistically guaranteed uncertainty estimates is a critical step towards trustworthy AI in high-stakes domains like healthcare. Addressing this for multi-modal data, which often provides a more complete picture for diagnosis, increases the potential impact. Successfully developing such a method could substantially improve clinical decision support systems by reliably flagging uncertain cases for human review, directly contributing to patient safety and potentially accelerating the adoption of ML in clinical practice."
