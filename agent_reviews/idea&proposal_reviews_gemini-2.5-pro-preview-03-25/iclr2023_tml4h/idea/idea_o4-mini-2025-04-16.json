        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea aligns perfectly with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed in the workshop scope, including 'Uncertainty estimation of ML models', 'Human-machine cooperation (human-in-the-loop, active learning) in healthcare', 'Multi-modal fusion and learning (CT, MRI)', and implicitly 'Learning informative and discriminative features under weak annotations' by optimizing the annotation process. The core motivation revolves around improving trustworthiness, which is the central theme of the workshop."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (limited data, calibration, trust), the core methodology (Bayesian uncertainty-driven active learning using specific metrics like predictive entropy and mutual information), the application domain (multimodal medical imaging - MRI/CT), the validation plan (specific tasks, datasets, and metrics like Dice, ECE, annotation time), and the expected outcomes (accuracy, calibration, efficiency, trust). It is concise and immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While active learning, uncertainty estimation (especially Bayesian methods), and human-in-the-loop approaches exist individually in medical imaging, the proposed combination is innovative. Specifically, using Bayesian uncertainty metrics (entropy and mutual information) to guide focused, interactive annotation in a multimodal setting, explicitly targeting both performance and calibration for trustworthiness, offers a fresh perspective. It's a thoughtful integration of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking technique, but novel in its specific application and focus."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Bayesian deep learning frameworks, uncertainty quantification methods, and active learning strategies are established research areas with available tools. Standard datasets for brain tumor segmentation and pulmonary nodule detection exist. Developing an interactive annotation interface is technically achievable. The main potential challenge lies in securing sufficient and consistent clinician time for the human-in-the-loop component, which is common in such studies but generally manageable within a research context. Computational requirements for Bayesian methods might be higher but are within the realm of current research capabilities."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical barriers to the clinical adoption of ML: the need for large labeled datasets and the lack of trust often stemming from poor model calibration and interpretability. By aiming to improve accuracy, enhance uncertainty calibration (linking it to clinical risk), reduce expert annotation burden, and foster clinician trust through collaboration, the research has the potential to make major contributions towards trustworthy AI in healthcare. Success could directly impact diagnostic accuracy and clinical workflow efficiency."
