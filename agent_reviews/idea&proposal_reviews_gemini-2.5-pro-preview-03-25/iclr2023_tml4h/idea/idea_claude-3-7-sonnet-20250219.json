        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task calls for research on trustworthy ML in healthcare, explicitly listing 'Privacy-preserving ML for medical data' as a topic of interest. The idea directly addresses this by proposing a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for multi-institutional healthcare collaboration, tackling a core challenge in applying ML to sensitive medical data."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (privacy constraints in healthcare data sharing) and the core proposal (FL framework combining DP and HE) are clearly explained. The key components like secure aggregation, adaptive noise, and handling data heterogeneity are mentioned. However, specifics on the 'adaptive noise injection calibrated to clinical significance thresholds' and the 'specialized mechanisms' for data heterogeneity could be slightly more detailed for perfect clarity, but the overall concept is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and Homomorphic Encryption are existing concepts, their specific combination within a framework tailored for multi-institutional healthcare collaboration, featuring adaptive noise injection linked to clinical significance and specialized handling of healthcare data characteristics (heterogeneity, imbalance), offers notable innovation. It's not proposing entirely new primitives but rather a novel synthesis and adaptation of existing techniques for a specific, challenging domain."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Federated learning frameworks exist, as do libraries for DP and HE. However, combining DP and HE efficiently can be complex. Homomorphic encryption, in particular, often introduces significant computational overhead, which might be a bottleneck for complex models or large-scale collaborations. Implementing and validating 'adaptive noise calibrated to clinical significance' requires careful design and domain expertise. Handling data heterogeneity effectively in FL is an ongoing research challenge. Significant engineering effort and potentially specialized hardware might be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing privacy concerns in multi-institutional healthcare data analysis is a critical problem hindering ML advancements. Successfully enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data could unlock access to larger, more diverse datasets, leading to more robust, generalizable, and fair healthcare ML models, especially for rare diseases. This directly contributes to building trustworthy AI systems for clinical applications, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals and having potentially major real-world impact."
