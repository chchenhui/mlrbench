        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key topics from the task description, such as multi-modal fusion, uncertainty estimation, interpretability, and benchmarks for trustworthiness in healthcare ML. It faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the motivation, core concepts (BNNs, attention, self-supervised task), and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the recent literature, acknowledging relevant methods (MDA, DRIFA-Net, HEALNet, DrFuse) and explicitly targeting the identified challenges (modality heterogeneity, missing data, noise, interpretability, uncertainty)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The introduction sets the stage well, the research objectives are distinct and understandable, and the expected outcomes are clearly listed. The methodology section outlines the main components (BNN module, fusion module, self-supervised task) and evaluation strategy logically. However, some technical details could be slightly more precise, particularly regarding how the BNN uncertainty and the self-supervised corruption prediction signal are mathematically integrated to inform the attention mechanism logits (beta_i). The provided formulas are standard but lack specific context within the proposed architecture. Despite minor ambiguities in implementation specifics, the overall research plan and rationale are communicated effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like Bayesian Neural Networks for uncertainty, attention mechanisms for fusion, and self-supervised learning are established techniques, their specific combination for dynamic modality reliability estimation in medical fusion appears novel. The core idea of using BNN-derived uncertainty *per modality* combined with a *dedicated self-supervised corruption prediction task* to dynamically weight modalities via attention offers a fresh perspective compared to the cited works, which use attention or handle missing data but perhaps not through this specific combination focused explicitly on instance-wise reliability estimation. It's more than an incremental improvement, offering a distinct approach to modality weighting based on learned reliability."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and methodologically rigorous. It builds upon well-established techniques (BNNs for uncertainty, attention for fusion, self-supervised learning). The rationale for combining these techniques to address modality reliability is logical. The proposed evaluation metrics (Accuracy, ECE, Interpretability) are appropriate for assessing the model's performance and trustworthiness aspects. However, the soundness score is slightly lowered because the proposal lacks precise technical details on how the uncertainty estimates and corruption predictions will quantitatively influence the attention weights. The mathematical formulations are somewhat generic and could be more specific to the proposed integration mechanism. Additionally, the practical challenges of training BNNs effectively are implicitly present."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on publicly available datasets (MIMIC, TCGA), which avoids data acquisition hurdles. The core methods (BNNs, attention, self-supervised learning) are readily implementable using standard deep learning libraries and computational resources typically available in ML research labs. Simulating modality degradation is a standard and feasible technique for evaluation. While training BNNs can be computationally intensive, it is a well-established practice. There are no obvious roadblocks suggesting the project is impractical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the field of medical AI: the trustworthiness of multi-modal fusion models. Ensuring models are robust to varying modality quality and provide reliable predictions with uncertainty estimates is critical for safe clinical deployment. The potential impact is substantial, potentially leading to more robust diagnostic systems, reduced risk of overconfident errors, and increased clinical acceptance through better interpretability and reliability. Developing benchmarks specifically for reliability-aware fusion would also be a valuable contribution to the community, facilitating future research and comparison."
