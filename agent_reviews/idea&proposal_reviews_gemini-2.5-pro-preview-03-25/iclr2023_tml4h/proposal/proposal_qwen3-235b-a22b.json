    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on trustworthy ML in healthcare, specifically tackling multi-modal fusion, uncertainty estimation, explainability, and robustness â€“ all key topics mentioned. The proposal accurately reflects the core research idea of dynamic modality reliability estimation using Bayesian NNs and attention. It effectively uses the literature review to position the work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods (MDA, DRIFA-Net, HEALNet, DrFuse) and motivating the need for its specific approach to dynamic reliability assessment. All sections consistently build towards the central theme of trustworthy multi-modal fusion."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the stage effectively, the objectives are specific and measurable, and the methodology section clearly outlines the three core components (Bayesian fusion, uncertainty-aware attention, self-supervised task) with sufficient technical detail, including relevant equations. The expected outcomes and impact are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow, and the language is precise. While deeper implementation details are omitted (as expected in a proposal), the overall concept, approach, and rationale are immediately understandable with no significant ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While components like Bayesian NNs, attention mechanisms, and multi-modal fusion are individually established, their specific integration to dynamically estimate modality-specific reliability based on input uncertainty and directly modulate attention weights appears novel compared to the cited literature. Existing works like DRIFA-Net use uncertainty (MC dropout) but not explicitly for dynamic reliability-based attention weighting in the proposed manner. DrFuse focuses on disentanglement and disease-specific weights, not input-driven reliability. The proposal clearly articulates this distinction, positioning the work as an advancement over static reliability assumptions or different uncertainty integration methods. The addition of the self-supervised task for corruption detection further enhances the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (Bayesian deep learning, attention mechanisms) and established methods. The proposed methodology, including the use of Bayesian variational inference for uncertainty and the specific formulation for uncertainty-aware attention, is technically plausible and well-justified. The technical formulations provided are correct representations of the intended concepts. The evaluation plan using standard datasets, metrics (including calibration), baselines, and ablation studies indicates methodological rigor. Minor gaps exist in specifying the exact Bayesian implementation details, but the overall approach is robust and well-reasoned for a proposal."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Implementing and training Bayesian neural networks, especially on large medical datasets, can be computationally expensive and requires specific expertise. Integrating this with attention and a self-supervised task adds complexity. However, suitable public datasets (CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, TCGA) are identified, and established libraries/techniques for Bayesian DL exist. The evaluation plan is standard. The main risks are related to computational resources and implementation complexity rather than fundamental roadblocks. With adequate resources and expertise, the project is achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the clinical adoption of multi-modal AI: trustworthiness, particularly robustness to real-world data imperfections (noise, missing modalities). Dynamically assessing modality reliability could lead to substantially more reliable and robust diagnostic systems. The focus on uncertainty quantification and interpretable attention directly contributes to building clinician trust. Success would represent a major advancement in multi-modal fusion, potentially setting a new standard for reliability-aware medical AI and facilitating safer deployment in clinical practice, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
