        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for trustworthy ML in healthcare, focusing on key themes like multi-modal fusion, uncertainty estimation, robustness to real-world data issues (noise, missingness), and interpretability. The proposed DRAM-Net framework directly implements the core research idea of dynamic reliability estimation using BNN uncertainty and attention. It explicitly acknowledges the challenges highlighted in the literature review (MDA, DRIFA-Net, HEALNet, DrFuse) and positions itself as a novel approach to address the specific gap of dynamically integrating data-driven reliability estimates into the fusion process, going beyond existing attention or missing data handling mechanisms mentioned."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely and logically. The proposed methodology (DRAM-Net architecture, BNNs for uncertainty, self-supervised task, reliability-guided attention) is explained in detail, including conceptual flow and specific implementation ideas (MC Dropout, VI, attention formulation). The data, training process, and experimental validation plan are clearly outlined. There are minimal ambiguities, and the overall structure makes the proposal easy to understand and follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like BNNs, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning are established, their specific integration for *dynamic modality reliability estimation* in multi-modal fusion appears novel. The core idea of using BNN-derived, modality-specific uncertainty *at inference time* to explicitly guide an attention mechanism, combined with a self-supervised task specifically designed to enhance sensitivity to data corruption, distinguishes it from the cited literature which might handle uncertainty or missingness differently (e.g., overall prediction uncertainty, static handling, different attention focuses). The novelty lies in this specific, synergistic combination aimed at improving trustworthiness through dynamic reliability assessment."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (BNNs, attention, self-supervision) and established methods (MC Dropout, VI). Using BNN uncertainty as a proxy for reliability is a theoretically plausible approach. The proposed architecture (DRAM-Net) and the reliability-guided attention mechanism are logically constructed. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, ablation studies, robustness tests, and appropriate metrics for performance, uncertainty quantification (calibration, correlation), and interpretability. Minor areas like the exact BNN implementation choice or the precise design of synthetic corruptions require further refinement during research, but the overall methodological approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current machine learning techniques and resources. It plans to use publicly available datasets (MIMIC, TCGA, BraTS), which enhances reproducibility. The core components (standard encoders, MC Dropout, attention, self-supervision) are implementable using existing deep learning libraries. While VI might add complexity, it's a known technique. The main challenges involve computational resources for training (especially with BNNs and multiple modalities) and careful hyperparameter tuning, which are standard research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues. The evaluation plan is practical and uses standard procedures."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of trustworthiness in multi-modal medical AI, a major barrier to clinical adoption. By aiming to improve robustness against real-world data imperfections (noise, missing data) and provide uncertainty-aware, interpretable predictions, the research has the potential to enhance patient safety and clinician trust. Success would represent a substantial contribution to trustworthy AI, multi-modal learning, and could accelerate the responsible deployment of advanced AI tools in clinical practice for tasks like diagnosis and prognosis. The alignment with the workshop's goals further underscores its significance."
