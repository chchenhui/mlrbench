        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of modularity to combat model obsolescence and enable reuse. Specifically, it falls squarely under the listed topics of 'Upcycling and MoE-fication' (converting dense models into modular frameworks) and 'Routing of Specialized Experts (MoErging)' (routing among pre-trained models). It also touches upon 'Mixture-of-Experts Architectures' (dynamic routing, sparse activation) and 'Applications of modularity' (mentioning continual learning). The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's rationale regarding the unsustainability of monolithic models and the need for reusability."

        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (dynamic upcycling of heterogeneous models), and main steps (decomposition, harmonization, routing) are understandable. Key techniques like parameter clustering, adapters, and router networks are mentioned. However, some aspects lack specific detail, such as the precise mechanism for task-agnostic decomposition using clustering and self-attention, the architecture of the adapters for harmonizing potentially very different expert outputs (especially cross-modal), and the exact design of the high-level router. While sufficient for a research proposal, minor ambiguities remain regarding implementation specifics."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While concepts like MoE, model upcycling ('MoE-fication'), using pretrained models as experts ('MoErging'), parameter clustering, and adapters exist individually, the proposed combination offers a novel perspective. Key innovative aspects include: 1) Focusing on *dynamic* upcycling, 2) Handling *heterogeneous* pretrained models (e.g., vision, language) within a single framework, 3) Proposing a specific decomposition strategy (clustering + self-attention routing) claimed to be task-agnostic, and 4) Employing a high-level router for input-dependent sparse combinations of these upcycled experts. It moves beyond simpler layer splitting or homogeneous expert combination."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible with current technology, though challenges exist. Using frozen pretrained models, training lightweight adapters (PEFT), and implementing router networks are established practices. Parameter clustering is feasible. The main challenges lie in: 1) Effectively decomposing diverse, potentially architecturally different models in a truly task-agnostic way using the proposed method. 2) Designing adapters and a routing mechanism capable of harmonizing and selecting experts from heterogeneous sources (e.g., different modalities, output spaces). This cross-modal integration is non-trivial. 3) Achieving the claimed high cost reduction (70-90%) requires careful implementation and validation. Overall, it's feasible but requires significant engineering effort, particularly for the heterogeneous aspect."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. It directly addresses the critical and increasingly relevant problems of computational waste, high training costs, and model underutilization in deep learning. If successful, it could provide a practical framework for sustainable AI development by enabling the reuse and composition of existing pretrained models. This could lead to substantial cost savings, foster collaborative model building, and enhance model capabilities in areas like continual learning and cross-modal reasoning by leveraging diverse, specialized knowledge without full retraining. The potential contribution to creating more adaptable and efficient AI systems is high."
