    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses core themes like modularity ('modular experts'), decentralization ('decentralized framework'), continual learning ('continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting'), and model recycling/reuse ('knowledge preservation protocol', 'reusable components'). It explicitly mentions concepts relevant to the workshop topics, such as specialized experts (akin to MoE), routing, and collaborative development, fitting perfectly within the scope of exploring alternatives to monolithic models."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main components (decentralized framework, distillation, modular experts, routing, preservation protocol, entropy metric), and overall goals are understandable. However, the specific mechanisms of the 'knowledge preservation protocol' (how parameters are identified and transferred from deprecated models) and the 'entropy-based metric' for specialization lack detailed definition, leaving some ambiguity. Further elaboration on these novel components would enhance precision."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While components like knowledge distillation, modular architectures, and decentralized learning are established, the proposed integration is innovative. Specifically, the concept of a 'knowledge preservation protocol' focused on transferring parameters directly from *deprecated* models into new modular structures, combined with decentralized distillation and an entropy-guided routing mechanism for continual learning, offers a fresh perspective. It's a novel synthesis aimed at creating an evolving ecosystem, rather than just applying individual techniques in isolation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is satisfactorily feasible but presents implementation challenges. Standard techniques like knowledge distillation, modular networks, and decentralized algorithms provide a foundation. However, the practical implementation of the novel 'knowledge preservation protocol' (identifying and mapping valuable parameters across potentially different architectures) and the development and validation of the 'entropy-based metric' require significant research and engineering effort. Coordinating the decentralized distillation and updates also adds complexity. It's plausible but not straightforward."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds good significance and impact potential. It directly tackles critical issues in modern deep learning: the wastefulness of discarding models, the sustainability challenges of ever-larger models, and the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. By proposing a framework for reusable, modular knowledge and collaborative development, it aligns with a crucial direction for the future of AI. Success could lead to more efficient, sustainable, and continuously adapting ML systems."
