        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics mentioned, including Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), Decentralized and Collaborative Training, communication efficiency, and model recycling ('expert recycling'). The motivation explicitly tackles the limitations of monolithic models and proposes a modular solution, which is the central theme of the workshop."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main proposal, and key innovations (sparse updates, router consensus, expert recycling) are articulated concisely and are easy to understand. The expected outcomes are specific. While minor implementation details (e.g., exact secure aggregation protocol for router consensus) could be further elaborated, the core concept is presented with excellent clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While Federated Learning and MoE are existing concepts, the proposed combination within a decentralized framework featuring sparse expert updates specifically for communication efficiency, router consensus via secure aggregation for handling heterogeneity, and explicit expert recycling presents a novel approach. It integrates several techniques in a unique way to address specific challenges in collaborative learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using existing technologies and methods. Federated learning frameworks, MoE implementations, sparse training techniques, and secure aggregation protocols are available. However, integrating these components into a robust, scalable system presents moderate engineering challenges, particularly regarding the efficiency of sparse updates transmission/aggregation and the implementation of the router consensus mechanism across potentially many diverse clients. Managing the lifecycle of recycled experts also requires careful design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Communication cost and data heterogeneity are critical bottlenecks hindering the widespread adoption and scaling of Federated Learning. The proposed approach directly targets these major challenges. Achieving substantial communication reduction (50-70% claimed) and improving performance on non-IID data would represent major advancements. Furthermore, enabling modularity and expert recycling contributes to more sustainable and collaborative AI development, aligning with important trends in the field."
