    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of modularity, decentralized learning, continual learning, and model reuse/upcycling. The research objectives precisely target the key challenges identified in the literature review (optimization, stability/plasticity, communication overhead, forgetting, knowledge transfer). The methodology incorporates concepts like modular experts, dynamic routing, knowledge preservation, and entropy metrics, which are central to the research idea and supported by the cited literature. There are no significant inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-structured and the overall goal is understandable. The objectives and expected outcomes are clearly stated. However, crucial details within the methodology lack clarity. Specifically, the 'knowledge preservation protocol' is mentioned but its mechanism (how parameters are identified and transferred) is not explained. The 'dynamic routing mechanism' formulation is generic, lacking specifics on the similarity measure or learning process. Most importantly, the 'decentralized' aspect, central to the proposal's title and objectives, is not elaborated upon in the methodology â€“ how the distillation and training are decentralized, communication strategies, etc., are missing. The exact role and implementation of knowledge distillation within the modular framework also require further clarification."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal integrates several contemporary research areas: modular networks, knowledge distillation, decentralized learning, continual learning, and knowledge preservation. While the literature review shows recent work exists for each component (e.g., m2mKD, DIMAT, modular CL methods, routing, preservation), the novelty lies in the specific *synthesis* of these elements into a unified framework. The proposed 'knowledge preservation protocol' for transferring knowledge from *deprecated* models into new modular architectures, combined with entropy-guided routing and decentralized knowledge distillation for continual learning, presents a potentially novel combination. However, it's more of an integrative novelty building upon existing ideas rather than introducing a fundamentally new concept or technique."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is built upon generally sound concepts prevalent in current ML research (modularity, KD, CL, decentralized learning). The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, the soundness is weakened by the lack of technical depth in the methodology. The mathematical formulations for entropy and routing are high-level and lack implementation specifics (e.g., how p(j|theta_i) is estimated). The feasibility and effectiveness of the vaguely described 'knowledge preservation protocol' are hard to assess. Furthermore, the absence of details on the decentralization mechanism and how knowledge distillation operates within it raises questions about the technical rigor and potential unforeseen challenges in optimization and convergence. The complexity of integrating all these components might lead to soundness issues not addressed in the proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is ambitious and presents significant implementation challenges. While individual components (modular networks, KD, basic routing) are feasible with standard tools, integrating them into a robust, decentralized framework with a novel knowledge preservation mechanism is complex. Success depends heavily on overcoming optimization difficulties in modular systems, managing communication in a decentralized setting, and effectively implementing the underspecified knowledge preservation and routing protocols. The research requires substantial computational resources for training and experimentation on large datasets like ImageNet. The lack of technical detail for key components increases the perceived risk and makes the feasibility somewhat uncertain without further refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research addresses highly significant and timely problems in deep learning: the sustainability crisis of ever-larger monolithic models, the challenge of continual learning without catastrophic forgetting, and the need for more collaborative and efficient AI development paradigms. By proposing a framework for modular, decentralized, and continual learning with knowledge reuse, the research aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals and tackles core issues limiting current AI systems. If successful, the work could lead to major advancements in creating more sustainable, adaptable, and efficient deep learning models, potentially having a substantial impact on both research and practice."
