    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop (modularity, decentralization, continual learning, sustainability, model reuse) outlined in the task description. The methodology closely follows the research idea, elaborating on decentralized modular knowledge distillation, dynamic routing, and knowledge preservation. Furthermore, it explicitly builds upon concepts mentioned in the literature review, such as module-to-module KD, decentralized training approaches (like DIMAT), dynamic routing, knowledge preservation techniques, and entropy-based metrics for specialization, integrating them into a cohesive framework. The objectives and proposed methods directly map to the workshop's scope and the initial idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-defined, and logically structured. It starts with a strong motivation, clearly lists the research objectives, details the methodology component by component (Modular Architecture, Decentralized KD, Routing, Preservation, CL Framework), outlines a comprehensive experimental design, and discusses expected outcomes and impact. Mathematical formulations are provided for key concepts. While generally clear, some specific technical details could benefit from further elaboration (e.g., the exact architecture of the router network, the specific similarity function 'sim' used in knowledge mapping). However, these minor ambiguities do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed research."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several existing research threads into a novel, integrated framework (ModuleMesh). While individual components like MoE, knowledge distillation, decentralized learning, dynamic routing, and knowledge preservation have been explored (as evidenced by the literature review), the specific combination proposed here – particularly the decentralized module-to-module knowledge distillation (M2MKD) coupled with a Fisher information-based knowledge preservation protocol within a continual learning context – offers a fresh perspective. The novelty lies more in the specific integration and the focus on sustainable, collaborative CL through this combined approach, rather than a single groundbreaking component. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by aiming for a holistic solution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established machine learning concepts such as Mixture-of-Experts, knowledge distillation, federated learning principles (for decentralization), continual learning strategies (replay, KD), and information theory (entropy, Fisher information). The proposed methodology for each component is logical and builds upon existing techniques cited in the literature. The mathematical formulations presented are generally correct and appropriate for the described methods. Minor gaps exist, such as the precise definition of the similarity function for knowledge mapping, but the overall technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current machine learning technologies and libraries. The core techniques (MoE, KD, federated averaging concepts, basic network training) are implementable. Standard datasets are proposed for evaluation. However, the integration of multiple complex components (decentralized training, dynamic routing, knowledge preservation, continual learning) presents significant engineering challenges. Debugging and tuning such a system will require considerable effort and computational resources, especially for the decentralized aspects and experiments on large datasets like ImageNet. While challenging, the plan is generally realistic, and the risks (optimization difficulties, communication overhead) are acknowledged implicitly or are common in such research, making it feasible within a well-equipped research setting."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses highly significant and timely problems in deep learning: the unsustainability of the 'bigger is better' paradigm, computational waste, catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, and the limitations of monolithic model design. By proposing a framework for modular, reusable, and collaboratively developed models with built-in knowledge preservation, the research has the potential for major impact. If successful, it could contribute to more sustainable AI practices, democratize AI development, accelerate innovation, and establish a new paradigm for model evolution. The potential contributions are substantial and clearly articulated, aligning perfectly with pressing needs in the field."
