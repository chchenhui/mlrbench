        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop (modularity, decentralization, continual learning, sustainability, upcycling via knowledge preservation) and the specific problems outlined (monolithic model limitations, catastrophic forgetting, computational waste). The proposed DMKD framework is a direct and elaborated implementation of the research idea, integrating concepts like modular experts, KD, decentralization, routing, and knowledge preservation. Furthermore, it effectively synthesizes and builds upon the provided literature, citing relevant papers for each component (m2mKD, DIMAT, subspace distillation, modular CL, routing, preservation, entropy metrics) and explicitly positioning itself to tackle the identified key challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, problem statement, proposed solution (DMKD), and research objectives are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the framework, algorithmic steps, mathematical formulations (where appropriate), and a comprehensive experimental plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow. While some fine-grained implementation details (e.g., exact parameter transfer mechanism, specific communication protocol tuning) are naturally left for the research execution phase, the overall concept, approach, and evaluation strategy are immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like modular architectures, knowledge distillation, decentralized learning, dynamic routing, and knowledge preservation concepts exist in the literature (as reviewed), the novelty lies in their sophisticated *integration* into the unified DMKD framework specifically tailored for sustainable, decentralized continual learning. The proposed 'knowledge preservation protocol,' which uses parameter salience (e.g., Fisher info) potentially guided by an entropy-based specialization metric to transfer knowledge between modules explicitly, appears to be a distinct contribution beyond standard KD or replay methods in CL. The combination of *decentralized* training with *modular knowledge distillation* and this *explicit preservation mechanism* for continual learning represents a fresh perspective and a novel synthesis of recent advancements."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (modularity, KD, CL principles, decentralized algorithms, information theory) and leverages well-established methods cited appropriately from the literature review. The proposed methodology is robust, detailing the framework architecture, algorithmic steps, and mathematical formulations for key parts. The experimental design is comprehensive, including standard benchmarks, relevant baselines (monolithic, standard CL, modular/KD CL, decentralized), appropriate evaluation metrics for both CL performance and efficiency, and crucial ablation studies to validate the contribution of each component. The rationale for the approach is well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing deep learning technologies, standard datasets, and computational resources (GPUs). The core techniques are implementable. However, the integration of multiple complex components (modular networks, dynamic routing, knowledge distillation, explicit knowledge preservation, decentralized coordination) presents significant engineering and tuning challenges. Ensuring these components work synergistically and efficiently requires careful implementation and experimentation. Managing communication overhead and potential optimization difficulties in the decentralized setting, especially with Non-IID data, adds complexity. While the plan is realistic, the successful execution requires substantial effort and expertise, carrying moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses critical and timely challenges in the field of deep learning: the unsustainability of the current large-model paradigm, the fundamental problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, the need for efficient knowledge reuse, and the barriers to collaborative AI development. By proposing a framework that integrates modularity, decentralization, and knowledge preservation, DMKD has the potential to lead to major advancements in creating more sustainable, adaptable, scalable, and collaborative AI systems. Success would make substantial contributions to continual learning, modular deep learning, decentralized AI, and the practical engineering of AI systems, aligning perfectly with the workshop's core themes and addressing pressing real-world concerns."
