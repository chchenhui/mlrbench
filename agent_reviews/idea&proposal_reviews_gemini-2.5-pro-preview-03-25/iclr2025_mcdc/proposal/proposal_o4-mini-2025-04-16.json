    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop task (modularity, decentralization, continual learning, upcycling, routing) and elaborates comprehensively on the research idea (DMKD framework, knowledge preservation, entropy routing, decentralized CL). The methodology explicitly incorporates and builds upon concepts mentioned in the literature review (m2mKD, DIMAT, modular CL, routing, knowledge preservation, entropy metrics), positioning the work effectively within the current research landscape. All sections of the proposal consistently reinforce the central theme and objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the overall framework (DMKD) is broken down logically. The methodology sections provide detailed steps, including mathematical formulations for key components like knowledge preservation, entropy calculation, routing, and decentralized updates. The experimental design is well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of the 'importance-weighted adjacency matrix' used for spectral clustering, but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding. The structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several existing concepts (modularity, knowledge distillation, decentralized learning, continual learning, model upcycling, dynamic routing) into a single, coherent framework (DMKD). The specific 'knowledge preservation protocol' aimed at upcycling deprecated models via importance scoring and clustering, combined with the entropy-based specialization metric guiding a dynamic routing mechanism, represents a novel approach within this integrated context. While individual components draw inspiration from prior work (e.g., DIMAT for decentralization, general KD principles), the specific combination and application, particularly the focus on sustainable reuse of legacy models in a decentralized CL setting, offer a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, building upon established methods like knowledge distillation, spectral clustering, entropy measures, and decentralized algorithms (DIMAT). The experimental design is thorough, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are minor weaknesses. The knowledge preservation protocol relies on heuristics (importance scoring) whose effectiveness needs empirical validation. The definition provided for the forgetting metric (\\max_{l<t}A_l(t)-A_t(t)) appears non-standard and potentially incorrect for measuring how much performance on past tasks degrades; a standard definition (e.g., based on the drop from peak accuracy A_l(l) - A_l(t)) would be more appropriate. Despite this, the core technical approach and experimental plan are largely well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard deep learning frameworks (PyTorch), publicly available datasets, and established techniques. The required computational resources (GPUs, potentially multiple nodes for decentralization simulation) are typical for ML research. While the integration of multiple complex components (modular distillation, clustering, routing, decentralized training, compression) presents engineering challenges, it appears achievable within the scope of a research project. The plan is realistic, and the risks associated with the effectiveness of specific components (e.g., knowledge preservation) are acknowledged implicitly through the experimental validation plan."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses highly significant and timely problems in deep learning: the sustainability crisis driven by ever-larger models, the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, and the need for collaborative and decentralized model development. By aiming to reuse knowledge from deprecated models, reduce computational waste, mitigate forgetting, and enable decentralized collaboration, the research has the potential for substantial impact. If successful, the DMKD framework could contribute to more sustainable AI practices, improve continual learning capabilities, and foster new paradigms for collaborative model building, aligning perfectly with the motivating factors outlined in the task description."
