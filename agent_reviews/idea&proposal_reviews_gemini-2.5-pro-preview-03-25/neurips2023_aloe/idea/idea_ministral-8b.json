        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (ALOE Workshop CFP). It directly addresses the core theme of open-ended learning (OEL) by proposing a method for sustained learning beyond initial task mastery. It explicitly mentions using adaptive curricula and quality-diversity algorithms, both highlighted as key areas of interest in the CFP. Furthermore, it aims to improve sim2real and out-of-distribution generalization, which are stated goals of OEL systems in the task description. The idea directly tackles the question posed in the CFP: 'Can we take advantage of substructures in open-ended problem spaces to efficiently train generally-capable agents, for example, through adaptive curricula?'."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main concept (dynamic curriculum via QD algorithms), and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The four proposed methodological steps provide a good overview of the approach. However, some details could be more precise for full clarity, such as the specific QD algorithm envisioned, the exact mechanism for assessing agent capabilities to guide curriculum adaptation, and how the 'self-improvement' component integrates with the QD-generated tasks. Despite these minor points needing elaboration in a full proposal, the core idea is understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While curriculum learning and quality-diversity algorithms are existing concepts in RL and evolutionary computation, their combination specifically for driving *sustained* open-ended learning by dynamically generating tasks based on ongoing agent performance and emergent skills is innovative. Using QD not just for initial diversity but as a continuous engine for adapting the learning environment offers a fresh perspective compared to static curricula or simpler difficulty scaling. The integration of a self-improvement mechanism further adds to the novelty, although this aspect is less detailed. It's a new combination and application of existing ideas to address the specific challenge of continuous OEL."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology but presents moderate challenges. Implementing RL agents and standard QD algorithms is possible. The main challenges lie in: 1) The computational cost of QD algorithms, especially if the task space or agent parameter space is large. 2) Designing effective task representations and diversity/quality metrics for the QD algorithm to generate meaningful and progressively challenging tasks. 3) Robustly assessing agent performance across a dynamically changing curriculum. 4) Implementing the 'self-improvement' aspect effectively without leading to instability. While challenging, these aspects seem addressable within a research context, particularly in simulation environments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Open-ended learning is a fundamental challenge in AI, aiming to create agents that can continuously learn and adapt like biological organisms. Successfully developing systems that sustain learning beyond initial task mastery would be a major advancement. This research directly addresses this critical problem. Potential impacts include more general and robust AI agents, better sim2real transfer, improved handling of novelty and complexity in real-world applications, and deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying OEL, aligning perfectly with the high-impact goals mentioned in the task description."
