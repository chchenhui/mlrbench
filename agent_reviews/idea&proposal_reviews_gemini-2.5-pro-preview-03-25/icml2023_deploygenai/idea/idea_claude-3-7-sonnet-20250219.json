    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for contributions focusing on 'Deployment critical features in generative models such as Safety' and 'challenges when applying Generative AI to impactful, real-world, interdisciplinary problems' like healthcare. GAISMOF directly addresses the challenge of safety monitoring for deployed generative AI in high-stakes domains, fitting squarely within the workshop's prioritized topics and overall theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is compelling, and the main components (stratified sampling, dual-mode monitoring, feedback loop, risk registry) are distinctly outlined. The overall goal of continuous, adaptive safety monitoring is well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific technical details of how each component would be implemented (e.g., specific algorithms for automated detection, precise structure of human teams, exact mechanism of feedback integration), but the core concept and framework structure are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea has notable originality. While individual elements like safety monitoring, automated detectors, human review, and feedback loops exist, GAISMOF proposes a novel integration into a comprehensive, adaptive framework specifically tailored for the continuous safety monitoring of deployed generative AI. The combination of stratified sampling for diverse populations, a dual-mode (automated + human adversarial) approach, and an evolving risk registry within a single, adaptive system offers a fresh perspective compared to static pre-deployment evaluations or more fragmented monitoring efforts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, but presents moderate implementation challenges. Stratified sampling requires access to usage data (potential privacy hurdles). Automated detectors need continuous development to keep pace with threats. The human oversight component requires significant, potentially costly, expert resources. Integrating these diverse components into a seamless, adaptive system is a substantial engineering task. Validation in controlled settings is a practical starting point. Overall, it's achievable but requires considerable effort and resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Ensuring the safety of deployed generative AI, especially in critical domains like healthcare and biology, is a paramount challenge. Current pre-deployment methods are often insufficient. GAISMOF addresses this gap by proposing a continuous, adaptive monitoring framework. Success could lead to major advancements in responsible AI deployment, establish best practices, increase trustworthiness, and facilitate the safer adoption of generative AI in high-stakes applications."
