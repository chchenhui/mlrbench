    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for research on deployment-critical features like Safety and Interpretability in generative models, specifically within the high-stakes domain of healthcare (medical imaging). The proposal faithfully expands on the core research idea of SAFEGEN, detailing the anomaly detection and interpretability components. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and builds upon methods discussed in the literature review, such as diffusion models for anomaly detection (Shi et al., 2023; Bercea et al., 2023, 2024; Fontanella et al., 2023) and interpretability techniques (Dravid et al., 2022; Lang et al., 2023; Hao & Cao, 2024), positioning the work within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure from introduction and motivation to methodology and expected impact. The research objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology section provides a clear overview of the SAFEGEN framework, including a helpful diagram, and details each component (Anomaly Detection, Feature Attribution, Taxonomy, Validation) with sufficient technical depth, including mathematical formulations where appropriate (e.g., diffusion process, anomaly scores, Grad-CAM, SHAP). The validation plan and deployment strategy are also clearly articulated. The language is precise and largely unambiguous, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like diffusion-based anomaly detection and interpretability methods (Grad-CAM, SHAP) exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the novelty lies in their specific integration into a comprehensive framework (SAFEGEN) explicitly designed for interpretable *safety assessment* of *generated* medical images. The combination of reconstruction-based and feature-based anomaly detection, coupled with multiple visual and semantic attribution methods tailored for this task, represents a fresh approach. The development of a dedicated medical imaging artifact taxonomy is also a significant novel contribution. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on the safety validation of generative outputs, rather than just general anomaly detection or model explanation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques like diffusion models, contrastive learning for feature extraction, and established interpretability methods (Grad-CAM, SHAP, counterfactuals). The proposed two-stage anomaly detection (reconstruction + feature-based) is a sensible approach to capture different types of anomalies. The inclusion of both visual and semantic attribution enhances the interpretability aspect. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive, incorporating quantitative metrics and a crucial expert radiologist study. Technical formulations are generally correct and clearly presented, although minor details regarding specific network architectures or the training of the semantic classifier could be further specified. The overall methodology is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Accessing the proposed datasets (MICCAI, TCIA, UK Biobank) is generally possible for research purposes. Training diffusion models and feature encoders, while computationally intensive, is standard practice. Implementing interpretability methods is also feasible. The main challenges lie in curating the augmented synthetic dataset with specific artifacts and conducting the expert validation study involving 10 radiologists, which requires significant coordination and resources but is achievable. The scope is ambitious, integrating multiple complex components, but the plan is realistic with clearly defined steps. API development and deployment integration are standard engineering tasks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: ensuring the safety and reliability of generative AI outputs in the high-stakes domain of medical imaging. Flawed synthetic data poses serious risks, and the lack of interpretable quality checks is a major barrier to deployment. SAFEGEN directly tackles this gap. Success would enhance patient safety, accelerate the development and adoption of generative models in healthcare by building trust, potentially standardize evaluation methods, and provide valuable tools for researchers, developers, clinicians, and regulators. The potential impact on improving diagnostic tools, medical training, and addressing data scarcity is substantial."
