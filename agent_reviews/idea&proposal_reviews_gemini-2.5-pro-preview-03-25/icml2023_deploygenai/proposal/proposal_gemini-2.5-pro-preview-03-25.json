        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of Safety, Interpretability, Robustness, Deployment Challenges, and Human-facing Evaluation in the context of generative AI for healthcare. The introduction explicitly links the problem to the workshop's focus. The methodology builds logically on the research idea and incorporates techniques (diffusion models for anomaly detection, XAI) highlighted in the literature review. The objectives and significance directly reflect the goals outlined in the initial idea and the challenges identified in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected impact. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section clearly outlines the two main components (ADM, IM), the data requirements, the proposed technical approaches (including mathematical formulations for key concepts), and a comprehensive experimental design. The inclusion of a Mermaid diagram aids understanding. While highly detailed, minor implementation specifics (e.g., precise adaptation of Grad-CAM for diffusion models) are understandably left for the research phase, but the overall plan is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the individual components (anomaly detection using diffusion models, XAI techniques like Grad-CAM/SHAP) exist in the literature (as shown in the review), their integration and specific application to provide *interpretable safety validation for synthetically generated medical images* is novel. The literature review primarily focuses on anomaly detection in *real* images or general interpretability of classifiers/generators. SAFEGEN's focus on validating the output of generative models themselves, providing localized feedback to improve safety and guide model development, represents a fresh and valuable contribution distinct from prior work cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques like diffusion models for anomaly detection (supported by recent literature like Bercea et al., 2024; Fontanella et al., 2023) and established XAI methods. The proposed methodology is robust, including specific model choices, loss functions, and evaluation metrics. The experimental design is comprehensive, incorporating quantitative validation (AUC, IoU), comparisons with baselines, and a crucial human-facing evaluation involving radiologists to assess clinical relevance. Technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. Potential challenges (e.g., adapting XAI) are acknowledged."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, assuming adequate resources. It relies on publicly available datasets and standard deep learning frameworks. Training diffusion models and implementing XAI techniques requires significant computational power and expertise, which is standard for this type of research. The most challenging aspect is likely the human evaluation component, requiring collaboration with radiologists and potentially ethical approvals (though mitigated by using public data initially). The plan to start with one modality is realistic. Overall, the project is ambitious but achievable for a well-equipped research team."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck hindering the safe deployment of generative AI in medical imaging â€“ the lack of reliable, automated, and interpretable methods to validate the quality and safety of synthetic data. Success would directly enhance patient safety, build trust in AI-generated data, accelerate the development of better generative models by providing targeted feedback, and potentially support regulatory processes. The research aligns perfectly with the growing need for responsible AI practices in high-stakes domains and directly addresses the key concerns highlighted in the workshop task description."
