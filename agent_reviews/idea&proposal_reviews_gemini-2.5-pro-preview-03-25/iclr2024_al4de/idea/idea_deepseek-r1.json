        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for exploring AI for solving differential equations in science, pushing boundaries in scientific computing, and specifically lists 'Explainability and interpretability of AI models in scientific contexts' as a key topic. The proposed idea directly addresses this by focusing on interpretable neural operators for solving DEs, aiming to enhance transparency for scientific discovery. It fits perfectly within the scope and goals of the AI4DifferentialEquations in Science workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-defined (lack of transparency in AI for DEs), the main idea is broken down into three distinct, understandable components (symbolic-neural hybrids, attention, counterfactuals), and the validation strategy and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The proposal is concise and leaves little room for ambiguity regarding its core concepts and objectives."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While neural operators and various interpretability techniques (sparse regression, attention, counterfactuals) exist independently, the proposed integration of these specific methods into a unified framework tailored for generating interpretable solutions to differential equations within scientific domains is innovative. The novelty lies in the specific combination and application focus, aiming to create intrinsically and post-hoc interpretable DE solvers, rather than just applying generic XAI methods after the fact. It's a fresh perspective on combining existing tools for a specific, challenging problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Neural operators, symbolic regression, attention mechanisms, and counterfactual methods are established techniques with available implementations. Standard PDE benchmarks exist for validation. However, integrating these components effectively (e.g., symbolic-neural hybrids, meaningful attention for complex dynamics) poses engineering challenges. Furthermore, evaluating explanation quality rigorously, especially involving domain expert feedback, requires significant effort and resources. While achievable, it requires careful design and potentially moderate optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. The lack of interpretability is a major bottleneck hindering the adoption and trust of AI models, including neural operators, in critical scientific fields like climate modeling, fluid dynamics, and biomedical engineering where understanding the 'why' is crucial. Successfully developing transparent DE solvers could accelerate scientific discovery, improve model validation, facilitate hypothesis generation, and build trust, leading to major advancements and wider AI adoption in science."
