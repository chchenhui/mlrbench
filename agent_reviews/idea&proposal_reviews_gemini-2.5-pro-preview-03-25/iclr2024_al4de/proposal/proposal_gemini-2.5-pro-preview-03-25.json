        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on AI for differential equations and the specific topic of explainability/interpretability. The proposal meticulously elaborates on the research idea, translating its core concepts (hybrid models, attention, counterfactuals) into concrete objectives and methodology. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, referencing specific papers and explicitly addressing key challenges identified (e.g., balancing accuracy and interpretability)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected impact are presented logically. The three main components of the proposed interpretable framework (symbolic-neural, attention, counterfactuals) are explained with sufficient detail, including relevant equations and mechanisms. The evaluation plan is comprehensive. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as more specific details on the architecture of the residual neural network component or the exact mechanism for learning input-dependent symbolic coefficients, but these do not significantly hinder overall understanding."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating three distinct interpretability techniques (symbolic-neural decomposition, attention mechanisms, counterfactual explanations) into a unified framework specifically designed for neural operators solving differential equations. While the individual techniques draw inspiration from existing work cited in the literature review (e.g., symbolic regression, attention, general XAI), their synergistic combination and application context are novel. It doesn't propose a single groundbreaking technique but rather a novel synthesis aimed at a specific, important problem. The distinction from prior work focusing on single interpretability aspects or different model types is clear."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (neural operators, sparse regression, attention mechanisms, counterfactual analysis) and established methods in SciML and XAI. The proposed methodology, including the hybrid model structure, loss function, attention integration, and counterfactual generation process, is technically well-founded. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, incorporating both quantitative metrics and qualitative expert assessment. Potential practical challenges, such as optimizing the symbolic-neural balance or ensuring the fidelity of attention maps, are acknowledged implicitly but do not undermine the fundamental soundness of the approach. Technical formulations are appropriate for a proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology (standard ML frameworks, PDE solvers) and methods. The required steps, including data generation, model implementation (building on existing operator codebases), training, and evaluation, are well-defined. However, the integration of the three interpretability components, particularly the tuning of the symbolic-neural hybrid model and the organization of domain expert evaluations, will require significant effort and careful implementation. The scope covering multiple PDEs and interpretability methods is ambitious but manageable within a dedicated research project. Risks related to the effectiveness of the symbolic component or the subjectivity of qualitative evaluations exist but seem manageable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized limitation of current AI methods in science â€“ the lack of interpretability, particularly for complex models like neural operators applied to differential equations. Success in this research could substantially enhance the trust, adoption, and utility of SciML tools in critical scientific domains (climate, CFD, materials, etc.) by providing transparency alongside accuracy. The potential to facilitate new scientific insights through model explanations further elevates its significance. The work directly aligns with advancing SciML frontiers and contributes valuable XAI techniques tailored for scientific problems."
