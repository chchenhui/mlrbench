    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for explainable and interpretable AI for differential equations in science. It meticulously follows the research idea, elaborating on the proposed integration of symbolic regression, neural operators with attention, and counterfactual explanations. Furthermore, it situates the work effectively within the provided literature, citing relevant works (e.g., FNO, DeepONet, LNO, PROSE) as foundations or baselines and addressing key challenges identified in the review, such as balancing accuracy and interpretability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the three core modules (SRM, NOA, CEE) with specific techniques (SINDy, FNO backbone, attention, counterfactual sensitivity) and mathematical formulations for key aspects like loss functions. The data generation, training procedure, and evaluation plan (including metrics, baselines, ablation, and robustness tests) are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow. The only minor detraction is the mention of 'Figure 1' which is not included in the text provided, slightly hindering visualization of the overview."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like neural operators (FNO), symbolic regression (SINDy), attention mechanisms, and counterfactual explanations exist in the literature (as highlighted in the review), the novelty lies in their specific *integration* into a unified 'Interpretable Neural Operator' (INO) framework. The proposed architecture, decomposing the solution map into a sparse symbolic component learned via SRM and a neural residual component learned via NOA, coupled with attention for feature attribution and CEE for causal probing, represents a fresh approach to tackling interpretability in this domain. It goes beyond simply applying existing XAI methods post-hoc by building interpretability into the model structure and training process. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by combining these specific elements."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (neural operators, sparse regression, attention mechanisms) and well-established methods (FNO, SINDy). The proposed methodology is robust, with clear mathematical formulations for the optimization problems and loss functions (including data fidelity, sparsity regularization, attention penalty, and physics constraints). The evaluation plan is comprehensive, incorporating quantitative metrics for accuracy, efficiency, and multiple facets of interpretability, alongside ablation studies and robustness tests. The inclusion of expert evaluation for interpretability adds further rigor. The staged training approach is logical for such a hybrid system. Potential challenges like hyperparameter tuning are acknowledged implicitly but the overall technical approach is well-justified and correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Generating data for the specified canonical PDEs is standard. Implementing the core components (FNO, SINDy-style regression, attention layers, counterfactual analysis) is achievable using standard ML libraries and hardware (GPUs). The required expertise aligns with typical SciML research. The evaluation plan is demanding but practicable. Potential challenges include the computational cost of training and tuning the hybrid model, ensuring the symbolic component remains meaningful, and the potential complexity of joint fine-tuning. However, these are research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks, making the project highly feasible within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the adoption of powerful SciML tools: the lack of transparency and interpretability, which hinders trust and scientific discovery. By aiming to create neural operators that are both accurate and explainable, the research has the potential to significantly advance the field. Success would facilitate deeper understanding of physical systems, accelerate hypothesis generation, and foster greater confidence in AI-driven scientific modeling, particularly in high-stakes areas like climate science and engineering mentioned in the task description. The planned open-source release further enhances its potential impact on the research community."
