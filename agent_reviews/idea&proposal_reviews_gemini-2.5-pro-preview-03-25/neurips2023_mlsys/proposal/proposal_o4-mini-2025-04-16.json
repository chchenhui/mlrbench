    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for ML in compute sustainability, specifically energy-aware job scheduling using ML. It elaborates precisely on the research idea (GreenSched using DRL for energy/carbon/SLA optimization). It clearly positions itself against the cited literature (CarbonClipper, PCAPS, CarbonScaler), aiming to improve upon them using DRL's expressiveness, and acknowledges the challenges identified in the review (balancing objectives, dynamics, scalability). The open-source benchmark goal also aligns with the task's emphasis on reproducible science."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a detailed MDP formulation (state, action, reward), specifies the DRL architecture (PPO, actor-critic, network details, loss function), outlines the simulator design, data sources, fine-tuning strategy, and experimental plan (baselines, metrics, scenarios). The structure is logical, and the technical language is precise. Equations and pseudocode enhance understanding. Minor details could be elaborated (e.g., exact action encoding), but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using RL for scheduling exists (e.g., the cited MARL paper), applying PPO specifically to optimize the combined objective of energy cost, carbon emissions, and SLA adherence within a single datacenter, incorporating dynamic power capping and VM migration as explicit RL actions, represents a novel approach compared to the cited heuristic (PCAPS), convex optimization (CarbonClipper), and elastic scaling (CarbonScaler) methods. The integration of simulation-based training with real-world fine-tuning on Kubernetes and the plan for an open-source benchmark framework further contribute to its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. The MDP formulation is appropriate, and PPO is a suitable, well-established DRL algorithm. The reward function correctly captures the multi-objective nature. The methodology includes key components like a high-fidelity simulator using real data, calibration from power models, a clear training loop, sim-to-real transfer considerations (off-policy correction, safe exploration), and a comprehensive experimental design with relevant baselines and metrics. Technical formulations appear correct. Potential challenges like simulator fidelity and sim-to-real gap are acknowledged. The scalability claim needs strong empirical validation but the plan mentions optimizations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Building the simulator and training the DRL agent are significant but achievable tasks using standard tools and techniques. Accessing the required data (traces, energy/carbon APIs) is realistic. The planned 20-node Kubernetes testbed is a reasonable scale for validation. Key risks include achieving sufficient simulator fidelity, ensuring stable DRL convergence for the complex state/action space, bridging the sim-to-real gap effectively, and demonstrating the claimed scalability. However, the plan includes reasonable steps to mitigate these (real data, calibration, off-policy methods, inference optimization), making it generally feasible with appropriate expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It tackles the critical problem of datacenter energy consumption and carbon emissions, directly aligning with global sustainability goals and the workshop's focus areas. The potential impact is substantial, with projected energy cost (15-30%) and carbon emission (20-40%) reductions. Furthermore, the development and release of an open-source, reproducible benchmark framework for carbon-aware scheduling would be a major contribution to the ML for Systems community, fostering further research and standardization. The insights into cost/carbon/performance trade-offs are also valuable for cloud providers and researchers."
