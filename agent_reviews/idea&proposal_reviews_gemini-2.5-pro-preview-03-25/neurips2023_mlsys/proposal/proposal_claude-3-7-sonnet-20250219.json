    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for ML applications in compute sustainability (energy/carbon optimization), mentions handling LLM workloads, and proposes an open, reproducible framework. It faithfully expands on the 'GreenSched' idea (renamed GreenScaler), detailing the RL approach, state/action/reward, simulation, and evaluation plans. It acknowledges the context set by the cited literature (CarbonClipper, CarbonScaler, etc.) and aims to tackle the identified challenges like balancing performance and sustainability using a multi-objective RL approach. The proposed baselines are relevant to the literature provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly listed. The MDP formulation (state, action, reward) is mathematically defined and explained. The chosen RL algorithm (PPO) and the conceptual neural network architecture are clearly described. The plans for data collection, simulation environment, experimental design (baselines, scenarios, metrics), and real-world deployment are specific and easy to understand. The expected outcomes are quantified, enhancing clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating multiple aspects into a single, comprehensive RL framework (GreenScaler using PPO). While individual components like carbon-aware scheduling, energy-aware scheduling, RL for scheduling, and multi-objective optimization exist (as shown in the literature review), GreenScaler's novelty lies in their synthesis: applying a specific RL algorithm (PPO) with a rich, combined action space (placement, resource allocation, power capping, migration) to simultaneously optimize for energy cost, carbon emissions, and SLA compliance using a unified reward signal. It explicitly tackles heterogeneity and dynamic factors (prices, carbon intensity) within this RL framework, potentially going beyond the scope of some cited works like CarbonScaler (focused on elasticity) or CarbonClipper (focused on spatiotemporal). Addressing LLM workloads within this context also adds timeliness. It's not introducing a fundamentally new algorithm but offers a novel, integrated application of advanced RL to a complex systems problem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. The formulation as an MDP is appropriate. PPO is a suitable and powerful RL algorithm for this type of control problem. The state and action spaces are comprehensive, capturing relevant system dynamics. The multi-objective reward function is well-defined and directly addresses the core goals. The plan to use realistic data sources, build a high-fidelity simulator, and validate with real-world deployment demonstrates methodological rigor. The inclusion of relevant baselines (including state-of-the-art) and diverse evaluation metrics strengthens the plan. Minor potential weaknesses include the inherent challenge of RL scalability in complex systems (though PPO is relatively robust) and the dependence on accurate forecasting models, but the proposal implicitly acknowledges these and plans sensitivity analysis."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. Required resources (data, compute, testbed) are standard for ML/Systems research, though the 20-server testbed requires significant setup. Building a high-fidelity simulator is complex but achievable. Training the PPO agent effectively will require significant effort and expertise due to the complex state/action space. Integration with Kubernetes is feasible but non-trivial. Key risks include RL training convergence/stability and potential gaps between simulation and reality. However, the plan includes both simulation and real-world validation, which mitigates risks. The project requires a strong team but seems achievable within a typical research project duration with adequate resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and growing problem of datacenter energy consumption and carbon footprint, directly aligning with global sustainability goals and the workshop's themes. The potential for substantial reductions in cost (15-30%) and emissions (20-40%), especially considering the scale of cloud computing and the rise of energy-intensive LLMs, is immense. By aiming to balance these reductions with performance (SLA compliance), it tackles a core challenge. The development of an open, reproducible framework would be a valuable contribution to the ML for Systems and sustainable computing communities, accelerating further research and potentially enabling practical adoption."
