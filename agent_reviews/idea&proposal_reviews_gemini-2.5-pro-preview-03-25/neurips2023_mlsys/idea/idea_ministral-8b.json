        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses applying machine learning (specifically RL) to a core computer systems problem (scheduling), aiming to replace heuristics, which is a central theme of the workshop. Furthermore, it targets LLM training scheduling, explicitly mentioned as a key emerging area of interest ('Applying ML to systems issues that emerge from large-scale training and serving'). It also touches upon compute sustainability by aiming to reduce resource consumption and energy, another highlighted topic. The focus on optimizing LLM training systems fits perfectly within the ML for Systems scope outlined."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, main components (environment, agent, reward, evaluation), and expected outcomes are clearly defined. The use of a multi-agent DQN framework provides a specific technical direction. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact state/action space representation or the complexity of the multi-agent interactions, but the overall concept and approach are readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While applying RL to scheduling problems is an established area, its specific application to the dynamic, large-scale, and complex nature of distributed LLM training scheduling is relatively new and challenging. The proposed multi-agent approach, where each compute unit (GPU/TPU) acts as an agent, offers a novel perspective compared to potentially simpler centralized RL controllers or traditional heuristics used in this domain. The core RL algorithm (DQN) is standard, but its application and the system modeling context provide notable originality."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing a high-fidelity simulation environment for large-scale distributed LLM training is complex and computationally expensive. Training a multi-agent RL system (like multiple DQNs) effectively in such an environment can be difficult due to issues like non-stationarity, coordination, and potentially large state/action spaces. Access to substantial computational resources (either real hardware clusters or powerful simulation infrastructure) would be necessary for meaningful training and evaluation. While conceptually sound, the practical realization requires considerable engineering effort and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. LLM training is notoriously expensive in terms of time, computation, and energy. Optimizing the scheduling of these massive, distributed workloads could lead to substantial reductions in training costs and carbon footprint, accelerating AI research and deployment. Developing more efficient, automated scheduling methods addresses a critical bottleneck in the field and aligns with the growing need for sustainable computing. Success in this area would be a major contribution to both the systems and ML communities."
