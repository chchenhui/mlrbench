        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for 'Applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization', providing 'energy-aware job scheduling' and 'ML-driven carbon footprint assessment for cloud datacenters' as examples. This proposal directly addresses this with 'Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Carbon-Aware Job Scheduling in Distributed Datacenters'. It uses RL, a technique mentioned in the task description, to replace heuristics in systems. It also touches upon systems issues related to large-scale workloads (relevant to LLMs mentioned in the task) and emphasizes reproducibility by proposing an open-source simulation environment, aligning with the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem and the gap in existing solutions. The main idea precisely describes the proposed HRL framework, differentiating between high-level (inter-datacenter allocation based on carbon, energy, urgency) and low-level (intra-datacenter resource management) policies. Key techniques (RL, transfer learning) and deliverables (open-source simulator) are specified. Expected outcomes are quantified, making the goals unambiguous. It is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While RL for scheduling exists, the application of HRL specifically for joint optimization of job scheduling and resource allocation across *distributed* datacenters, dynamically considering real-time carbon intensity, energy prices, and workload urgency simultaneously, is innovative. The hierarchical decomposition of the problem and the integration of transfer learning for adaptability add to the novelty. It offers a fresh, integrated perspective on sustainable computing compared to fragmented or single-objective approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training a complex HRL system across distributed environments with multiple objectives is non-trivial. Real-time data acquisition (carbon intensity, energy prices, detailed system states across sites) can be difficult. Developing a comprehensive and realistic open-source simulation environment is a substantial engineering effort. While the underlying techniques (RL, HRL) exist, integrating them effectively and achieving the ambitious quantitative goals requires considerable expertise, data access, and computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and growing environmental impact of datacenters (~2% of global CO2 emissions). Optimizing for carbon footprint alongside performance is crucial for sustainable cloud computing and AI development. A potential 30-40% reduction in carbon footprint would be a major advancement. The research bridges ML and systems for sustainability, relevant to industry and academia. The proposed open-source environment could catalyze further research and benchmarking in this vital area."
