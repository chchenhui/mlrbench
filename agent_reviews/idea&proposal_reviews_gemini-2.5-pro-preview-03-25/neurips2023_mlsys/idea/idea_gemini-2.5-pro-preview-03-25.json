        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on 'Applying ML to systems issues that emerge from large-scale training and serving, such as compiler partitioning schemes for training LLMs across thousands of GPU or TPU devices'. The proposed idea directly addresses this specific topic using Reinforcement Learning, a technique encouraged by the workshop, to improve compiler partitioning for distributed LLM training, replacing traditional heuristics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the motivation (inefficiency of current partitioning), the core proposal (RL framework for adaptive partitioning), the inputs (computation graph, hardware topology, real-time feedback), the actions (selecting partitioning schemes), and the objectives (minimize time, maximize utilization). The comparison to static heuristics is explicit. Minor details about the specific RL algorithm or state/action space representation could be added, but the overall concept is immediately understandable and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality and innovation. While using ML/RL for systems problems isn't entirely new, applying RL specifically to learn *adaptive* compiler partitioning strategies for LLMs based on *real-time feedback* from the training process is a novel approach. It moves beyond static analysis or predefined heuristics commonly used. The potential integration of GNNs for graph representation adds another layer of novelty. It represents a fresh perspective on optimizing distributed training parallelization."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technologies (RL frameworks, GNNs, system monitoring tools). However, significant implementation challenges exist. Defining an effective state/action space for complex LLMs and large clusters is non-trivial. Training the RL agent might be computationally expensive and require careful reward shaping. Integrating the RL agent's dynamic decisions into the training loop without introducing prohibitive overhead requires careful engineering. Access to large-scale distributed hardware is necessary for meaningful evaluation. While challenging, it is within the realm of research feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Efficiently training LLMs is a critical bottleneck in modern AI, involving massive computational resources and costs. Suboptimal partitioning leads to significant waste. Improving partitioning strategies, even moderately, can lead to substantial reductions in training time, energy consumption, and cost, accelerating AI research and deployment. The problem is timely and addresses a major pain point in the field, making potential solutions highly valuable."
