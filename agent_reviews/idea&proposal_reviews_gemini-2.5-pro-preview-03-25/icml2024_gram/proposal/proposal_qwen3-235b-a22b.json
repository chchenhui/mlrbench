    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (focus on geometry-grounded learning, equivariance, manifolds), the research idea (embedding geometric priors like SE(3) equivariance and manifold optimization for motion planning), and the literature review (addressing key challenges like generalization and physical constraints using methods discussed in recent papers). It directly tackles the workshop themes and the specific goals outlined in the research idea, referencing relevant concepts and challenges from the literature."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, overall methodology (two-stage pipeline), algorithmic components (equivariant encoder, manifold optimizer), and experimental plan are clearly articulated. Mathematical notations are used appropriately. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for deriving the SDF from the encoder's manifold representation and the specific type/implementation of steerable filters, but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding. The structure is logical and easy to follow."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing the specific integration of SE(3) equivariant encoding of obstacles with Riemannian optimization for trajectory generation directly on the configuration manifold. While individual components (equivariance, manifold optimization in robotics) exist in recent literature (as cited), their synthesis into this particular two-stage architecture for motion planning appears novel and distinct from prior work. The claim of being the 'first integration' seems plausible in this specific configuration."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in geometric deep learning (SE(3) equivariance) and differential geometry (Riemannian manifolds, geodesics, optimization). The proposed methodology, combining an equivariant encoder with Riemannian gradient descent for trajectory optimization, is technically well-founded. The mathematical formulations presented are generally correct. Minor points, like the exact mapping from obstacles to the manifold structure used for optimization and collision checking, could be elaborated further, but the core approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Tools and libraries for SE(3) equivariance (e.g., PyTorch3D mentioned) and Riemannian optimization exist, but integrating them effectively into a robust motion planning system requires considerable expertise and effort. Training such models and performing manifold optimization can be computationally demanding. Data collection plans are reasonable. The primary risks involve the complexity of system integration and ensuring the learned geometric structures accurately support collision-free planning, especially for generalization."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical and persistent challenge of efficient, generalizable, and physically plausible motion planning in robotics. By leveraging fundamental geometric principles (equivariance, manifold structure), it has the potential to lead to major advancements over existing methods, particularly in terms of generalization and inherent constraint satisfaction. The expected quantitative improvements (speed, success rate) and theoretical contributions are substantial, with clear applications in important domains like industrial automation and medical robotics."
