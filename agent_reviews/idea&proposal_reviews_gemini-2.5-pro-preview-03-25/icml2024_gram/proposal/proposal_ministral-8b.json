    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (geometry-grounded learning, structure-inducing/preserving priors, robotics application), the research idea (geometric priors, SE(3) equivariance, Riemannian optimization for motion planning), and the literature review (addresses key challenges like generalization and constraints, builds upon recent relevant work like SE(3) nets, manifold methods, Riemannian optimization). It directly tackles the core themes of the workshop and the specific goals outlined in the idea, using concepts highlighted in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear about the overall goal, motivation, and high-level approach (two-stage architecture). However, it lacks clarity in crucial technical details within the methodology. Specifically, the exact nature of the 'manifold-aware representation', how the geometric encoder's output defines or modifies this manifold, and the precise mathematical formulation (especially the definition of L_geodesic and L_constraints and their relation to the network outputs) are ambiguous. The claim of avoiding explicit regularization seems contradicted by the presented loss function, requiring further clarification."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several advanced concepts (SE(3) equivariance, learned manifold representations, Riemannian optimization) into a specific two-stage architecture for motion planning. While individual components are present in the literature (as evidenced by papers [6, 7, 8]), their proposed integration – using an equivariant encoder to learn/inform the obstacle-aware manifold structure for subsequent geodesic planning – offers a fresh perspective compared to existing methods cited. It's a novel combination rather than a groundbreaking new concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is built upon sound theoretical foundations (geometric deep learning, manifold theory, Riemannian optimization, SE(3) equivariance) referenced in the literature. The high-level methodology (encode geometry, plan on manifold) is logical. However, the soundness is weakened by the lack of rigor in the technical details. The mathematical formulation is underdeveloped and potentially inconsistent regarding the handling of constraints (explicit term vs. implicit via manifold). Key aspects like how the manifold is represented computationally and how geodesics are computed on this potentially learned manifold are unspecified, leaving questions about the technical robustness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While components like SE(3) networks and Riemannian optimization tools exist, integrating them as proposed is non-trivial. Key challenges include accurately learning a useful manifold representation incorporating obstacles from the encoder output, and efficiently performing Riemannian optimization (e.g., geodesic computation) on this potentially complex, high-dimensional, learned manifold. Success requires overcoming these considerable technical hurdles, making the implementation effort substantial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and persistent problem in robotics – efficient, generalizable, and safe motion planning. By leveraging geometric priors, it aims to tackle key limitations of current methods (sample efficiency, generalization, physical plausibility). If successful, the research could lead to major advancements in robot autonomy, enabling faster, more robust navigation in complex environments. The potential impact on robotics and related fields like geometric deep learning is substantial, aligning well with the workshop's focus."
