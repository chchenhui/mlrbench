        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's theme of Geometry-grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modeling. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed: 'Structure-preserving learning' through equivariant operators on Lie groups, 'Dynamical systems on manifolds' via score-based diffusion (an SDE on the manifold), and 'Generative modeling and density estimation' specifically for 'generating geometric objects' (molecules, shapes) on non-Euclidean spaces (Lie groups). The emphasis on preserving symmetries and manifold structure is central to both the idea and the workshop's motivation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of standard models on symmetric manifolds), the core technical proposal (score-based diffusion on Lie groups using Riemannian geometry and equivariant networks), the key components (forward process, score network, sampling), and the expected outcomes (valid, equivariant samples, data efficiency). The use of specific concepts like Lie groups, Riemannian metrics, exponential maps, group convolutions, and Riemannian Langevin dynamics makes the approach technically precise. Minor ambiguities might exist only at the level of specific implementation choices, but the overall research direction is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several advanced concepts. While diffusion models on manifolds, score-based generative models, and equivariant networks exist independently, their specific integration for generative modeling *directly on Lie groups* using *Riemannian score matching* with *explicitly equivariant networks* represents a novel and sophisticated approach. It extends prior work on manifold diffusion and equivariant modeling by providing a unified framework tailored to the important structure of Lie groups, which is not a standard or trivial extension."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Implementation requires expertise in differential geometry (Lie groups, Riemannian metrics), stochastic differential equations on manifolds, and equivariant deep learning. While theoretical foundations exist and relevant software libraries (e.g., for geometric deep learning) are maturing, implementing and training such a model, especially the Riemannian Langevin dynamics and equivariant score network on potentially complex Lie groups like SE(3), requires considerable effort and computational resources. Debugging and ensuring numerical stability on the manifold could also be challenging. It is feasible for a specialized research team but not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant due to its potential impact on various scientific and engineering domains. Generating valid and equivariant samples on spaces like SO(3) and SE(3) is crucial for molecular modeling (conformer generation), robotics (pose estimation/planning), and 3D computer vision/graphics (shape synthesis). Addressing the limitations of standard generative models in these geometrically constrained settings could lead to major advancements, improved sample quality, better data efficiency due to symmetry exploitation, and more physically realistic results. The principled geometric grounding aligns with a major trend in modern machine learning."
