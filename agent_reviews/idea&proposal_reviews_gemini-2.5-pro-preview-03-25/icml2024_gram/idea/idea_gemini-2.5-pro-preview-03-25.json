        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on geometry-grounded representation learning and generative modeling, particularly emphasizing structure preservation on manifolds and generative models for non-Euclidean data. The proposed Geodesic Diffusion Models (GDMs) directly address this by developing a generative model specifically designed for Riemannian manifolds, using SDEs on manifolds (a listed topic under 'Structure-preserving learning') to generate geometric objects or data residing on manifolds (a listed topic under 'Generative modeling'). The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's rationale."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. It clearly articulates the problem (standard diffusion models fail on manifolds), the proposed solution (Geodesic Diffusion Models), the core mechanisms (forward diffusion via Riemannian SDEs, reverse denoising using manifold-aware networks and tangent space updates via exponential map), and the goal (generating geometrically valid samples). The concepts are explained concisely with minimal ambiguity, making the research direction immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While diffusion models are established and research on applying them to manifolds exists, this proposal outlines a specific, principled approach grounded in Riemannian geometry (geodesics, Laplace-Beltrami, tangent spaces, exponential maps). It combines manifold SDEs for the forward process and manifold-aware neural networks for the score function in a coherent framework. Compared to naive adaptations of Euclidean diffusion, it's highly novel. Within the specialized field of manifold diffusion, it might represent a specific refinement or combination of emerging techniques rather than a completely groundbreaking concept, but it offers a distinct and well-motivated approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires expertise in both deep learning and Riemannian geometry. Implementing manifold-specific operations (geodesics, exponential maps, Laplace-Beltrami operator), simulating Riemannian SDEs, and developing/utilizing manifold-aware neural network architectures (e.g., equivariant or manifold convolutional layers) require specialized knowledge and tools. While these components exist in the literature and relevant libraries are emerging, integrating them into a stable and efficient diffusion model will require significant effort and computational resources. It is achievable within a research context but not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of standard generative models when applied to inherently non-Euclidean data, which is common in many scientific domains (e.g., molecular modeling, shape analysis, neuroscience, computer vision). Successfully developing GDMs could lead to major advancements in generating realistic and valid data in these areas, potentially enabling breakthroughs in drug discovery, material science, medical imaging analysis, and fundamental understanding of complex systems. Preserving geometric structure is often crucial for the utility of generated samples."
