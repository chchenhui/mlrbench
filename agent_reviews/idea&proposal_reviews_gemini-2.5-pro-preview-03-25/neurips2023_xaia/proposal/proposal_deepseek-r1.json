    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the task description's focus on cross-domain XAI applications, challenges like transferability, and the goal of identifying strategies to advance applied XAI. It directly implements the research idea of using meta-learning for transferable explanation modules (MetaXplain). It also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as domain-specificity and data scarcity. The objective of transferring explanation patterns across domains fits the workshop's aim to explore transferring insights between use cases. While highly consistent, it could slightly better position itself against the very recent, similar works mentioned in the literature review to achieve a perfect score."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is very clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. The use of MAML is specified, and the experimental plan including baselines, metrics, and validation protocol is clear. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise architecture of the explainer module 'g_phi' and the exact formulation of the combined loss function, but these do not significantly impede understanding of the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a relevant problem with a modern technique (meta-learning). However, the literature review provided includes several recent papers (2021-2024) explicitly mentioning meta-learning for XAI, transferable explanation modules, gradient-based meta-learning for interpretability, and few-shot XAI. Titles like 'Transferable Explanation Modules for Cross-Domain XAI' (2024) and 'Universal Explainer Networks via Meta-Learning' (2024) suggest the core concept is not entirely new. The proposal doesn't sufficiently differentiate MetaXplain's specific approach or contribution from this existing body of work. The novelty appears incremental, likely residing in the specific implementation details or the joint optimization strategy, rather than being groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound theoretical foundations, leveraging the well-established MAML framework for meta-learning and standard XAI concepts/metrics (saliency, AUFC). The proposed methodology, extending MAML to jointly optimize task performance and explanation fidelity, is technically plausible. The experimental design is rigorous, including baselines, ablation studies, and human evaluations. The mathematical formulation is concise but appears correct for the described approach. A minor weakness is the assumption of readily available, consistent expert annotations across diverse domains, and the details of the combined loss function could be more explicit."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The technical implementation using MAML and standard XAI tools is feasible with current ML libraries and expertise. The main challenges lie in the data aspect: curating diverse datasets with high-quality, consistent expert annotations across 3-5 source domains and 2 target domains is a significant undertaking. Achieving the ambitious target of high fidelity (>=90% AUFC) with very few (k=5) samples on unseen domains might prove difficult in practice. While challenging, the overall plan is realistic for a well-resourced research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in applied XAI: the lack of transferability and the high cost of deploying domain-specific explainers. Developing a method for creating universal, adaptable explanation modules would be a major advancement, potentially democratizing XAI, facilitating regulatory compliance, and fostering trust in AI across various sectors. The potential impact aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of extending the frontiers of applied XAI and could lead to substantial contributions to the field."
