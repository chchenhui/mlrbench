        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the application of Explainable AI (XAI) in Healthcare, which is explicitly listed as a key area for the workshop. The idea focuses on implementing specific XAI methods (SHAP, LIME) to enhance transparency and trust, fitting the workshop's aim to explore present applications and methodological requirements. It also touches upon future potential by aiming to develop a framework. While it doesn't explicitly cover all workshop topics like historical analysis or transferability between domains as deeply, its strong focus on a core application area makes it highly relevant."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The motivation (lack of trust in healthcare AI), the main objective (develop tailored XAI for trust), the proposed methods (SHAP, LIME, user testing), and the expected outcomes/impact are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The step-by-step methodology provides a clear roadmap for the research. It is immediately understandable what the research aims to achieve and how."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Applying established XAI techniques like SHAP and LIME to healthcare models is a known research direction. However, the specific focus on enhancing *patient* trust (alongside provider trust) through rigorous user testing involving both groups, and the iterative refinement process based on this feedback, adds a practical and user-centric dimension that is less common. The goal of developing a specific framework for healthcare XAI based on these findings also contributes some novelty. It's more of an innovative application and validation approach rather than a fundamentally new XAI technique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. The technical aspects, such as training AI models and applying SHAP/LIME, are well within current capabilities. However, obtaining high-quality, comprehensive medical datasets often involves significant hurdles related to privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA), data sharing agreements, and potential biases in data. Conducting user studies with both patients and healthcare professionals requires careful ethical considerations (IRB approval), significant recruitment effort, and robust study design. While achievable, these aspects require substantial resources and institutional collaboration."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Trust is a critical barrier to the adoption and effective use of AI in healthcare, a domain with high stakes. Enhancing transparency and trust through XAI can directly lead to improved patient adherence, better-informed clinical decisions, and potentially reduced medical errors. Developing a validated framework for XAI in healthcare could influence best practices and regulatory standards. Addressing this problem effectively could yield major advancements in the safe and ethical deployment of AI in medicine."
