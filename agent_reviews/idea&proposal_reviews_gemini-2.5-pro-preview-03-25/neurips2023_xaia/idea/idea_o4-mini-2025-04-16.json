    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of transferring insights/methods across use cases ('Explore whether insights gained from one use case can be transferred to other use cases'). It proposes a concrete method to facilitate the application of XAI in new domains, tackling the challenge of costly re-engineering, which is an obstacle hindering progress ('Identify the obstacles that hinder progress... and how can we overcome them'). The focus on enabling XAI in emerging fields aligns with discussing future applications and identifying new domains for XAI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation, main concept (meta-learning for transferable explainers), methodology (MAML-style training, data requirements, evaluation strategy), and expected outcomes are clearly defined and easy to understand. The use of specific terms like 'MAML-style' and metrics like 'adaptation speed' and 'fidelity' adds precision. While minor implementation details could be further specified (e.g., exact explainer architecture), the core research proposal is unambiguous and well-articulated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While meta-learning is an established technique, its application to create universal, transferable XAI modules across highly diverse domains (healthcare imaging, finance, NLP) is innovative. Most XAI methods are domain or model-specific. Proposing a framework specifically designed to learn 'explanation patterns' transferable via meta-learning offers a fresh perspective on tackling the challenge of XAI generalizability and reducing domain-specific engineering effort."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is satisfactory but faces significant challenges. Firstly, collecting paired datasets with consistent, high-quality expert annotations (e.g., saliency maps, feature importance) across vastly different domains like medical imaging, financial modeling, and NLP is difficult and resource-intensive. The nature of a 'good explanation' and its annotation format might vary significantly. Secondly, designing a single 'universal explainer' architecture that is effective and adaptable via meta-learning across such diverse input modalities and model types presents a substantial technical hurdle. MAML itself can be challenging to train effectively. These factors raise concerns about practical implementation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and potential impact. Successfully developing transferable explanation modules would address a critical bottleneck in the practical deployment of XAI â€“ the high cost and effort required to adapt methods to new domains. It could dramatically accelerate the adoption of interpretable AI in various fields, especially emerging ones, and promote more consistent standards for AI transparency. Reducing the annotation burden is also a significant practical benefit. This directly contributes to advancing applied XAI, a core goal of the workshop."
