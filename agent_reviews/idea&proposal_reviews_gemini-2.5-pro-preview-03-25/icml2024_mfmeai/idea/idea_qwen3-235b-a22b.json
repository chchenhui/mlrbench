        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Multi-modal Foundation Model meets Embodied AI' (MFM-EAI). Specifically, it tackles key workshop questions like 'What constitutes an effective system architecture for MFM-based Embodied AI Agents?' by proposing a hierarchical architecture, and 'How can MFM augment the perceptual and decision-making capabilities... balancing their high-level decision-making prowess with the nuanced requirements of low-level control?' by suggesting RL agents and a feedback loop to bridge this gap. The idea fits squarely within several listed topics, including 'Framework design', 'Decision-making', and 'Low-level control' for MFM-powered embodied agents. The focus on robotic manipulation is a concrete example of Embodied AI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (bridging high-level MFM reasoning and low-level control) is well-defined. The main components (MFM for high-level parsing, RL for adaptive low-level control, bidirectional feedback loop) are clearly outlined. The inclusion of an example ('Pour coffee...') aids understanding. The proposed training methodology (hybrid sim-physical, IL, offline RL) and expected outcomes are also stated. While some implementation details (e.g., the exact mechanism of the feedback loop, the specific RL architecture, how MFM outputs precisely guide RL policies) could be further elaborated, the core concept is presented with good clarity and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. While using MFMs for high-level planning and RL for low-level control are established techniques, and hierarchical architectures are common in robotics, the proposed novelty lies in the *dynamic* and *adaptive* nature of the integration. Specifically, the emphasis on a bidirectional feedback loop allowing low-level sensor data to potentially correct or refine high-level MFM guidance in real-time, and the use of RL agents to *adaptively* translate MFM outputs, offers a degree of innovation over static pipeline approaches. It's more a novel synthesis and refinement of existing concepts focused on adaptation rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. The core components (MFMs, RL algorithms, simulators, robotic hardware) are available. However, integrating them into a robust, adaptive system is complex. Key challenges include: acquiring sufficient and diverse training data (both simulated and real), effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap (despite the proposed hybrid approach), training RL agents conditioned on potentially complex MFM outputs, ensuring the stability and effectiveness of the bidirectional feedback loop, and managing the computational demands of running large MFMs alongside real-time control loops. Significant engineering effort and resources would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses a critical bottleneck in applying powerful MFMs to real-world robotics: the robust integration of high-level semantic understanding with low-level physical interaction in dynamic environments. Success would represent a substantial advancement, potentially leading to more capable, adaptable, and generalizable robots for complex tasks. Improving generalization and robustness, and potentially reducing computational overhead via decoupling, are important goals with direct relevance to applications like assistive robotics, logistics, and exploration. The research tackles a core challenge highlighted in the task description."
