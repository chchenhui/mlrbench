        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task focuses on the intersection of Multimodal Foundation Models (MFM) and Embodied AI (EAI), specifically highlighting challenges like effective system architectures and balancing high-level MFM capabilities with low-level control. The proposed 'Adaptive Perceptual Grounding' directly addresses these points by suggesting a framework (multimodal encoder, grounding module, feedback loop) designed to bridge the gap between high-level semantic understanding (from MFMs) and low-level control signals required for embodied agents. It explicitly targets the core question of how MFMs can augment perception and decision-making while handling nuanced low-level control, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope and topics like framework design, decision-making, and low-level control."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (MFM limitations in EAI) and the core concept ('adaptive perceptual grounding') are understandable. The proposed three-component architecture provides a structural overview. However, the specifics of the 'grounding module' (how the mapping occurs) and the 'feedback loop' (how refinement happens based on outcomes) lack detail. While the overall goal is clear, a deeper explanation of the mechanisms within the grounding module and feedback loop would enhance precision and remove minor ambiguities about the exact implementation."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using foundation models for high-level tasks in robotics and the concept of grounding perception/language to action are existing areas of research, the proposed 'adaptive perceptual grounding' mechanism offers a fresh perspective. Specifically, the dynamic mapping adjusted via a feedback loop based on action outcomes, tailored for integrating large MFMs with low-level control in embodied agents, represents a novel approach. It combines existing concepts (MFMs, grounding, feedback) in a new way to tackle the specific challenge of the semantic-control gap in MFM-driven EAI."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, but presents moderate implementation challenges. Leveraging existing MFMs as encoders is practical. Standard simulation environments can be used for evaluation. The main challenge lies in designing, implementing, and training the 'grounding module' and the 'feedback loop'. Defining the action primitives, learning the dynamic mapping function, and effectively incorporating feedback will require significant research and engineering effort, potentially involving reinforcement learning or other adaptive techniques. While not straightforward, it appears achievable within the current state of ML research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck hindering the application of powerful MFMs in real-world embodied AI: the difficulty in translating high-level semantic understanding into effective, context-aware, low-level actions. Successfully bridging this semantic-control gap, as proposed, could lead to major advancements in robotics and embodied AI, enabling agents to perform more complex, nuanced tasks in dynamic environments. This directly tackles a central theme of the MFM-EAI task description and has the potential for substantial contribution to the field."
