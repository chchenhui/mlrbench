    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of the workshop: the intersection of Multi-modal Foundation Models (MFM) and Embodied AI (EAI). The idea explicitly proposes developing a framework for MFM-powered embodied agents, training MFMs for embodied scenarios, and balancing high-level decision-making with low-level control, which correspond directly to the key questions and topics listed in the task description (e.g., framework design, training/evaluation in open-ended environments, augmenting perception/decision-making, balancing high/low-level control)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main goal (developing an integration framework), key components (training, architecture, balancing control), and expected outcomes are clearly stated. It effectively communicates the research direction. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific mechanisms for balancing high-level decisions and low-level control, or the precise nature of the proposed system architecture, but these are often elaborated upon in more detailed proposals. Overall, the concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While integrating MFMs with embodied AI is a very current and active research area (as evidenced by the workshop call itself), the proposal outlines a research direction rather than a specific, groundbreaking technique within that direction. The novelty lies in the potential development of a *specific* framework, training strategy, or balancing mechanism, but the summary describes the *goal* of addressing these known challenges. It combines existing, powerful concepts (MFMs, EAI) in a timely and relevant manner, offering potential for novel implementations, but the core concept aligns with emerging trends rather than being entirely unique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Necessary components like MFMs (accessible via APIs or open-source models), simulation environments for embodied AI (e.g., Habitat, Isaac Sim), and multi-modal datasets exist. The main challenges lie in the research aspects: designing an effective system architecture and developing robust methods for balancing high-level MFM outputs with low-level control signals. These are significant engineering and research tasks but are within the scope of current ML and robotics research capabilities, assuming adequate computational resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Enhancing the perception and decision-making of embodied agents is a critical challenge in AI and robotics. Leveraging the power of large-scale MFMs holds immense potential for creating more capable, adaptable, and intelligent agents that can operate effectively in complex, open-ended real-world environments. Success in this area could lead to major advancements in robotics, autonomous systems, human-robot interaction, and other fields relying on embodied intelligence."
