        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the workshop overview: 'balancing their [MFM's] high-level decision-making prowess with the nuanced requirements of low-level control in embodied systems'. The proposed hierarchical framework is a direct attempt to provide an 'effective system architecture for MFM-based Embodied AI Agents' and falls squarely under the listed topic 'Low-level control in Embodied Agents empowered by MFM'. It also touches upon evaluation in simulation, another listed topic."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (semantic-action gap), the proposed two-module hierarchical structure (semantic planner and low-level controller), the bridging mechanism (cross-modal alignment loss), and the validation plan (simulation benchmarks) are all clearly defined and easy to understand. The specific examples like 'force-sensitive grasping' and 'pour water into the cracked cup' further enhance comprehension. There are no significant ambiguities in the core concept."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While hierarchical approaches and the use of MFMs for planning or RL for control exist independently, the proposed synthesis is innovative. Specifically, the concept of using an MFM as a semantic planner generating intermediate representations explicitly designed (via an alignment loss) to be actionable by a low-level RL controller addresses the MFM-EAI integration challenge in a fresh way. It moves beyond simply using MFMs for high-level goals and tackles the direct interface with low-level execution."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Training large MFMs and complex RL policies requires significant computational resources. Designing an effective cross-modal alignment loss and ensuring the intermediate representations are truly beneficial for the low-level controller are non-trivial research questions. Generating sufficient paired trajectory data might also be demanding. Sim-to-real transfer, mentioned as a goal, adds another layer of complexity common in robotics. However, the components (MFMs, RL, simulation environments) are available, making the research direction plausible with current technology and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds excellent significance and potential impact. Successfully bridging the gap between high-level semantic understanding (MFMs) and precise low-level motor control is a critical bottleneck in creating truly capable embodied agents. Enabling robots to perform complex manipulation tasks requiring both reasoning and dexterity, as suggested, would represent a major advancement for fields like logistics, healthcare, and assistive robotics. The potential to 'democratize deployment of MFM-powered agents' highlights its high impact potential."
