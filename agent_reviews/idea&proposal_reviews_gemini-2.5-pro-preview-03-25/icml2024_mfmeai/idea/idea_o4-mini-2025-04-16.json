        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses key questions posed by the MFM-EAI workshop, specifically regarding effective system architectures for MFM-based embodied agents and how MFMs can augment perception/decision-making while balancing high-level reasoning and low-level control. The proposed hierarchical structure (MFM + HRL) fits squarely within the workshop's topics, including 'Framework design for MFM-powered embodied agents', 'Decision-making in Embodied Agents empowered by MFM', and 'Low-level control in Embodied Agents empowered by MFM'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-defined. The motivation is concise, and the proposed two-tiered architecture (frozen MFM top tier, HRL bottom tier) is explained logically. The roles of the high-level MFM (semantic understanding, affordances, goals) and the low-level HRL controller (subgoal selection, motion primitives) are distinct and understandable. The training strategy using self-supervised exploration and MFM-generated pseudo-instructions is also outlined. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific MFM choice, the exact nature of the 'semantic affordance maps', or the specific HRL algorithms, but the overall concept is articulated effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using MFMs for high-level understanding and HRL for control in robotics are individually established research areas, the proposed specific integration offers a fresh perspective. The architecture featuring a frozen MFM generating semantic representations (affordance maps, goal representations) that directly inform the high-level policy of an HRL system is a thoughtful combination. Furthermore, the proposed training mechanism involving self-supervised exploration bootstrapped by MFM-generated pseudo-instructions adds an innovative element. It builds upon existing trends but proposes a distinct and potentially synergistic framework."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods, but presents moderate implementation challenges. Leveraging a *frozen* MFM significantly enhances feasibility compared to end-to-end training. HRL frameworks and realistic simulators are available. However, successfully training HRL policies, especially hierarchical ones, is known to be sample-inefficient and requires careful tuning. The proposed self-supervised bootstrapping mechanism adds another layer of complexity requiring careful design and validation. Achieving robust sim-to-real transfer for the learned policies remains a significant hurdle in robotics. Overall, it's achievable within a well-resourced research setting but requires significant effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. It addresses a critical bottleneck in embodied AI: effectively translating high-level semantic understanding from powerful MFMs into precise, low-level actions required for interaction with the physical world. Successfully implementing this hierarchical controller could lead to more capable, generalizable, and sample-efficient robots that can operate robustly in complex, open-ended environments. This directly contributes to the core goals of the MFM-EAI field and could represent a meaningful advancement in robot learning and control."
