        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core questions posed in the task description, such as designing system architectures for MFM-powered agents and balancing high-level semantics with low-level control. The methodology precisely follows the research idea, detailing the two-tiered MFM-HRL architecture. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as sample efficiency, generalization, and sim-to-real transfer, grounding its approach in relevant prior work like PaLM-E and HRL studies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the hierarchical architecture involving the frozen MFM and HRL controller is described logically. The roles of the high-level policy and low-level controllers are defined, along with the general training approaches (imitation learning, RL) and evaluation strategy. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for MFM-generated pseudo-instructions/affordances and the specific RL algorithms to be used, but these do not significantly hinder the understanding of the core proposal. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using MFMs for semantic understanding and HRL for control are established concepts, the specific architectural choice of integrating a *frozen* MFM (leveraging pre-trained knowledge without fine-tuning) to provide high-level guidance (semantic affordances, goals) to a separate HRL system is a distinct approach. The idea of using the MFM's outputs to bootstrap HRL training via self-supervised exploration with pseudo-labels in simulation adds to the novelty. It's a novel combination and application of existing techniques to address the specific MFM-EAI challenge, rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid foundations in HRL (hierarchical decomposition of tasks) and the use of large pre-trained models (MFMs) for perception/understanding. The proposed two-tiered architecture is logical for separating semantic reasoning from low-level control. Using simulation, imitation learning, and RL for training are standard and appropriate methods. Freezing the MFM is a reasonable design choice to leverage powerful models while focusing training on the control policy. Potential weaknesses lie in the assumption that the frozen MFM's outputs will be sufficiently informative for the HRL agent and the inherent challenges of HRL training stability, but the overall methodology is well-justified and technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. It requires access to pre-trained MFMs, significant computational resources for HRL training in simulation, and potentially real-world robotic hardware for transfer experiments. These resources are typically available in specialized labs. The core technologies exist. However, training HRL agents effectively can be complex and sample-intensive, even with the proposed bootstrapping. Achieving robust sim-to-real transfer is a well-known challenge in robotics that may require substantial effort beyond what is detailed. The success hinges on the quality of MFM outputs and the effectiveness of the HRL training process, introducing moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in embodied AI: effectively translating rich semantic understanding from powerful MFMs into concrete low-level actions. This is central to developing more capable and intelligent robots that can operate in complex, open-ended environments. Success would lead to advancements in sample efficiency, generalization, and real-world applicability of embodied agents, impacting areas like service robotics, autonomous systems, and human-robot interaction. The potential contributions are substantial and align directly with pressing research questions in the field."
