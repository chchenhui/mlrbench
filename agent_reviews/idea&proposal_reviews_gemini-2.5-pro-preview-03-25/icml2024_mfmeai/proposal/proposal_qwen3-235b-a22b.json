        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core questions posed in the MFM-EAI task description, such as designing effective system architectures, balancing high-level MFM capabilities with low-level control, and evaluation. The proposed two-tiered architecture perfectly matches the research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (H2O2, PaLM-E, HIDIO), positioning itself clearly within the field and directly tackling the key challenges identified (semantics-control gap, sample efficiency, generalization, multimodal integration, real-world transfer)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context well, the objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the architecture, data collection, training stages, and experimental design. The hierarchical structure and the roles of the MFM and HRL components are well-explained. Mathematical formulations are included for key concepts. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of the subgoal representation 'm_t' or specific network architecture details, but these do not significantly impede understanding of the core proposal. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using MFMs for perception and HRL for control are known concepts, the specific architectural choice of combining a *frozen* MFM (for semantic grounding and goal generation) with a *trainable* HRL controller (for action execution) is a distinct approach compared to monolithic models like PaLM-E or pure HRL systems. The integration of self-supervised exploration bootstrapped by MFM-generated pseudo-instructions adds another layer of innovation. It's not a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift but offers a fresh, well-motivated combination of existing techniques to address specific challenges in MFM-EAI."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in MFMs, HRL (PPO, DDPG), imitation learning, and self-supervised learning. The proposed methodology, including the two-tiered architecture, staged training protocol, and fusion strategies, is technically well-founded and appropriate for the problem. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Mathematical formulations are provided and appear generally correct. The reliance on frozen MFM outputs is a key assumption that needs validation, but the overall approach is robust and well-justified by the literature and the problem statement."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant engineering challenges. It requires substantial computational resources (GPUs for MFM inference and RL training), access to high-fidelity simulators (TDW, Habitat), and potentially expensive robotic hardware for real-world validation. Integrating the MFM outputs effectively with the HRL policies and ensuring stable training of the hierarchical system will be complex. Sim2Real transfer, despite planned mitigation strategies, remains a major hurdle. However, the reliance on existing pre-trained MFMs and simulation environments makes it more practical than starting from scratch. The plan is ambitious but realistic for a well-resourced research team."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in AI and robotics: bridging the gap between the powerful semantic understanding of MFMs and the requirements of low-level control for embodied agents. Successfully developing such a framework could lead to major advancements in robot capabilities, sample efficiency, and generalization. The potential to leverage large, pre-trained MFMs without costly retraining makes the approach particularly relevant. Positive results could significantly impact applications like assistive robotics, logistics, and autonomous systems, aligning well with the goals of the MFM-EAI field."
