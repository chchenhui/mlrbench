        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem outlined in the task description (interpretability in large models, moving beyond post-hoc methods) and the research idea (multi-level distillation for 'interpretability islands'). The methodology explicitly incorporates techniques (concept distillation, rule extraction, neural-symbolic integration, multi-level distillation) highlighted in the provided literature review, and acknowledges the key challenges mentioned, such as the performance-interpretability trade-off. It effectively translates the research idea into a concrete plan that resonates with the themes of the task description and the state-of-the-art presented in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The objectives are stated precisely. The methodology is broken down into logical, understandable components (Concept Distillation, Decision Path Extraction, Neural-Symbolic Integration), each with clear steps and supporting mathematical formulations where appropriate. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, metrics, and validation strategies, is clearly outlined. Expected outcomes are quantified, enhancing clarity. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan readily comprehensible."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several recent techniques from the literature (concept distillation, rule extraction, neural-symbolic integration, multi-level distillation) into a single, cohesive framework. While the individual components are present in the 2023 literature review provided, their specific combination and application to create 'interpretability islands' within foundation models by selectively replacing components represents a novel approach. It moves beyond applying these techniques in isolation and proposes a structured, multi-faceted integration strategy. The novelty lies more in the specific architectural integration and selective application than in inventing entirely new base methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established machine learning concepts (knowledge distillation, attention, influence functions, decision trees, regularization) and recent research trends identified in the literature review. The methodological steps are logical, and the provided mathematical formulations are appropriate for the described tasks. The use of influence functions to identify critical components and distillation losses (KL, MSE) are standard and sound practices. However, the complexity of integrating the three distinct modules and ensuring the hybrid model's coherence and performance presents a challenge. The effectiveness of replacing parts of a complex foundation model (like transformer blocks) with distilled rule-based systems requires strong empirical validation, and details on the 'probabilistic logic layer' could be more specific."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. It requires significant computational resources, access to large foundation models and specific datasets (like MIMIC-III), and crucial collaboration with domain experts. While the underlying techniques (distillation, tree induction, etc.) are known, integrating them into a stable and effective hybrid system ('interpretability islands') is complex and will require substantial engineering effort and careful tuning. Achieving the ambitious quantitative targets (e.g., <=5% accuracy drop, >=90% completeness) poses a risk, and ensuring the fidelity and coherence of the integrated system is non-trivial. The cross-domain transfer goal adds further complexity."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the lack of interpretability in powerful foundation models. This 'black box' issue is a major bottleneck for deploying AI in high-stakes, regulated domains like healthcare and finance, as highlighted in the task description. Successfully developing a framework that embeds interpretability without substantial performance loss would be a major contribution, enhancing trust, facilitating audits, aiding bias detection, and potentially aligning AI with regulatory requirements (e.g., EU AI Act). The potential impact on both the research community and real-world AI applications is substantial."
