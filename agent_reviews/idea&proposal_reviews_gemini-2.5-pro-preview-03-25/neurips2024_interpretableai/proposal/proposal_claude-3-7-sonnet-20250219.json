        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of foundation model interpretability highlighted in the task, elaborates comprehensively on the multi-level distillation idea, and grounds its methodology firmly in the concepts presented in the literature review (multi-level distillation, concept-based, decision path, neural-symbolic, selective distillation). It explicitly aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the literature and answers several key questions posed in the task description regarding interpretability for large models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and evaluation plan. Research objectives are specific and measurable. The multi-level distillation framework, including impact-based identification, concept distillation, decision path extraction, neural-symbolic integration, and coherent integration strategies, is explained with high precision, including relevant mathematical formulations. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are thorough and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the individual components (concept distillation, decision path extraction, neural-symbolic methods, selective distillation) exist in recent literature (as shown in the review), the novelty lies in their synthesis into a single, coherent multi-level framework. The specific idea of creating targeted 'interpretability islands' within foundation models based on impact scores, combining these diverse interpretability techniques, represents a fresh approach. It's not entirely groundbreaking in its base techniques but offers an innovative integration strategy for a challenging problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established machine learning concepts (knowledge distillation, concept bottlenecks, decision trees, symbolic regression) and recent research cited in the literature review. The methodology is well-reasoned, linking different interpretability levels to potential stakeholder needs. Mathematical formulations are provided and appear correct. The evaluation plan includes appropriate metrics for performance, fidelity, and interpretability. Minor gaps exist in the fine-grained details of implementation (e.g., specific symbolic regression constraints, ablation methods), but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Successfully implementing and integrating three distinct distillation techniques (concept, path, symbolic) into large foundation models across three different domains (NLP, CV, Tabular) is highly ambitious. Key challenges include the computational cost of impact scoring and distillation, ensuring fidelity across all levels, achieving seamless integration without significant performance loss, and the scalability of techniques like symbolic regression. Significant computational resources and deep expertise across multiple areas are required. The plan is logical but optimistic regarding the complexity involved."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of opacity in foundation models, a major bottleneck for trust, regulation, and scientific understanding in AI. By aiming to provide multi-level interpretability without sacrificing performance, the research has the potential to enable the responsible deployment of powerful AI in high-stakes domains, contribute to regulatory compliance, and deepen the scientific understanding of large models. The potential contributions are substantial and clearly articulated."
