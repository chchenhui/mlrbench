    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of foundation model (FM) opacity highlighted in the task description, acknowledges the limitations of post-hoc methods, and proposes an approach centered on knowledge distillation (KD) as suggested by the research idea. The methodology explicitly integrates concepts and techniques mentioned in the literature review (concept distillation, decision paths, neural-symbolic integration, selective distillation, multi-level approaches) and addresses key challenges identified (trade-offs, component identification, fidelity, scalability). It also connects to the broader goals mentioned in the task description, such as auditing, debugging, safety, and regulatory compliance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The background, research gap, objectives, and methodology are presented logically. The different components of the proposed framework (concept, path, neural-symbolic) are explained with their goals and general methods. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are clearly outlined. However, some technical details, particularly within the mathematical formulations (e.g., precise definitions of proxy signals, local distributions, equivalence loss), remain somewhat abstract and would require further specification for implementation. The integration mechanism for the different interpretable 'lenses' could also be slightly more detailed."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several recent KD-based interpretability techniques (concept mapping, path extraction, neural-symbolic conversion) into a single, unified, multi-level framework specifically designed for FMs. While the individual techniques draw heavily from the cited literature, the novelty lies in their integration, the proposed selective distillation strategy based on component importance, and the specific goal of creating different interpretable 'views' attached to the original FM. It offers a fresh perspective compared to single-level or non-selective approaches, although it doesn't introduce fundamentally new distillation algorithms for each component."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in existing research on FMs, interpretability, and KD, referencing relevant literature appropriately. The proposed methodology, combining different distillation types and a selective strategy, is theoretically plausible. The experimental plan includes necessary components like baselines, ablations, and user studies. The evaluation metrics correctly target the key dimensions of interpretability, fidelity, and performance. Minor weaknesses include the high-level nature of some technical formulations and the inherent difficulty and potential optimism regarding the effectiveness of identifying suitable modules and achieving high-fidelity neural-symbolic conversion, which are acknowledged research challenges."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While individual components are based on existing research, successfully integrating them into a robust framework, especially the neural-symbolic conversion part, is ambitious and technically demanding. Ensuring high fidelity for all distilled components across diverse FMs and tasks will require considerable effort and potentially further innovation. Identifying critical components accurately and efficiently is also non-trivial. The project requires substantial computational resources and expertise. While feasible for the specified models (BERT, ViT) with adequate resources, the complexity and potential roadblocks, particularly in scaling and achieving high fidelity in NeSy conversion, lower the feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely challenge of interpreting large-scale FMs, which is a major bottleneck for their trustworthy deployment in high-stakes domains. By aiming to provide multi-level, faithful interpretations, the research has the potential to enhance transparency, facilitate debugging and auditing, support regulatory compliance, enable safer AI systems, and advance the scientific understanding of FM mechanisms. The potential contributions, including the framework, validated techniques, and open-source tools, could have a substantial impact on both the research community and AI practitioners."
