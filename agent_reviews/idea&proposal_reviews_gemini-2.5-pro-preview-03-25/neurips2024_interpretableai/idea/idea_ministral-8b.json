    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Interpretable AI', focusing on inherently interpretable models, particularly for large-scale systems, which is a central point in the task description. It tackles the challenge of scalability and the limitations of post-hoc methods, aligning perfectly with the workshop's motivation. Furthermore, it implicitly relates to several key questions posed, such as 'What interpretability approaches are best suited for large-scale models?', 'What are the inherent limitations of interpretability?' (by addressing privacy constraints), and 'What are the diverse applications?' (by mentioning healthcare and finance)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main components (interpretable architecture, federated aggregation with constraints, privacy), and expected outcomes are laid out logically. However, the specifics of how 'interpretability constraints' will be defined and incorporated into the federated aggregation algorithms are not fully detailed, leaving some ambiguity about the core technical mechanism. Similarly, the interplay between differential privacy and maintaining interpretability could be elaborated further. Minor refinements on these technical aspects would improve clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While Federated Learning (FL) and Interpretability are established fields, their proposed integration specifically for *collaboratively building inherently interpretable models* is innovative. The core novelty lies in designing FL aggregation algorithms that explicitly enforce interpretability constraints and applying privacy techniques to preserve interpretability features during this collaborative process. This moves beyond simply applying post-hoc explanations to federated models and represents a fresh approach to building trustworthy large-scale AI."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Designing inherently interpretable architectures and implementing basic FL frameworks are achievable with current technology. However, the core component – developing federated aggregation algorithms that effectively incorporate and maintain potentially complex 'interpretability constraints' across decentralized clients without direct data access – is technically challenging and requires substantial research innovation. Ensuring that differential privacy mechanisms preserve interpretability rather than obscuring it adds another layer of complexity. Access to suitable distributed datasets for validation also poses a practical hurdle."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and growing need for interpretable large-scale models, particularly in high-stakes domains where trust and transparency are paramount. By tackling the dual challenges of scalability and privacy through Federated Learning, the proposed framework could lead to major advancements in deploying trustworthy AI systems in sensitive areas like healthcare and finance, where data centralization is often impossible. Success would represent a substantial contribution towards building more reliable, auditable, and human-aligned AI."
