        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the need for interpretable AI for large-scale foundation models, specifically focusing on mechanistic interpretability, a key topic mentioned. It explicitly proposes incorporating domain knowledge (biomedical, legal) and aims to produce truthful insights for experts and auditors, aligning with the task's emphasis on high-stakes domains and reliability over potentially unfaithful post-hoc methods. It tackles several key questions posed, such as suitable approaches for foundation models, incorporating domain expertise, and assessing explanation quality (via causal validation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with distinct motivation, a well-defined main idea broken down into five logical steps (Ontology/Dataset, Probing/Clustering, Mapping, Validation, Graph Construction), and stated evaluation goals. The overall objective of creating a 'truthful, modular interpretability toolkit' is unambiguous. While the high-level steps are clear, specific details on the algorithms for probing, clustering, mapping, and causal intervention are not fully elaborated, leaving minor ambiguities typical of a research summary but sufficient for understanding the core proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While mechanistic interpretability, using domain knowledge/ontologies, and causal validation are existing research areas, the proposed contribution lies in their systematic integration into a cohesive framework (DAMD). Specifically, the structured approach of probing, clustering, mapping discovered modules directly onto a formal domain ontology, and constructing a causal graph of these domain-specific modules appears innovative. It moves beyond general circuit discovery towards identifying and labeling functionally relevant modules aligned with specific domain concepts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Curating comprehensive domain ontologies and aligned concept datasets requires substantial domain expertise and effort. Probing vast numbers of neurons/heads in foundation models and performing meaningful clustering is computationally intensive and methodologically complex. Reliably mapping abstract neural components (modules) to specific ontology nodes is non-trivial and potentially subjective. Performing rigorous causal validation (ablations/activations) at scale and constructing an accurate causal graph of module interactions are ambitious undertakings. Success requires significant computational resources, specialized expertise (ML and domain-specific), and potentially methodological breakthroughs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. It addresses the critical and pressing problem of opacity in foundation models, which hinders their trustworthy deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law. Providing mechanistically grounded explanations aligned with domain concepts could substantially improve model understanding, debugging, bias detection, and auditability compared to purely post-hoc or less grounded methods. Success would represent a major step towards building more trustworthy and accountable AI systems, directly impacting real-world applications and potentially influencing regulatory approaches."
