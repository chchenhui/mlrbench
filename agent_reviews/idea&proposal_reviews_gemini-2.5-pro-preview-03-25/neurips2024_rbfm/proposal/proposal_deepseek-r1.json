        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: enhancing reliability (hallucinations, harmful content, fairness), identifying failure sources, and promoting sustainability through preemptive measures during pre-training. The methodology clearly operationalizes the research idea by combining knowledge-guided contrastive learning and dynamic dataset curation. Furthermore, it effectively integrates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the provided literature review, citing relevant works and positioning itself within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to methodology and expected outcomes. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology outlines the key components and algorithmic steps with supporting formulas. The experimental design is well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise calculation of the knowledge similarity score 's_kg' (specifically, how the nearest knowledge graph embedding is determined relative to the visual and text embeddings) and the exact mechanisms for pruning/retraining in the dynamic curation step (e.g., thresholds). However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed approach."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating multiple existing techniques (knowledge-guided contrastive learning, adversarial filtering, dynamic dataset curation based on a knowledge consistency score) into a single, unified pre-training framework for multimodal models. While individual components draw inspiration from or exist in prior work (as indicated in the literature review, e.g., Knowledge-CLIP, dynamic curation concepts, adversarial filtering), their synergistic combination aimed at simultaneously improving reliability (knowledge grounding + bias filtering) and sustainability (dynamic pruning) during pre-training offers a fresh perspective. The novelty lies primarily in this specific synthesis and integrated application rather than the invention of entirely new techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical foundations like contrastive learning, knowledge graph embeddings, and adversarial training. The proposed methodology is plausible, and the use of formulas adds technical detail. However, some aspects require further justification or clarification for full rigor, such as the precise formulation and weighting of the knowledge similarity term (s_{kg}) in the contrastive loss and the specific implementation details of the dynamic curation mechanism (thresholds, impact on training stability). The experimental design, including baselines, metrics, and ablation studies, appears robust and appropriate for validating the approach. Technical formulations are mostly correct but lack full precision in places (e.g., s_{kg} definition)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, leveraging publicly available datasets and established techniques. However, integrating knowledge graphs, implementing multimodal contrastive learning, training adversarial filters, and managing dynamic dataset curation within a large-scale pre-training pipeline presents significant engineering challenges and requires substantial computational resources. The dynamic nature of data curation and potential retraining adds complexity. While ambitious, the project is within the scope of current large-scale ML research capabilities, assuming access to adequate compute infrastructure and expertise. The claimed efficiency gains need empirical validation but suggest consideration of resource constraints."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses critical and timely challenges in the development of multimodal foundational models: reliability (hallucinations, harmful content, fairness) and sustainability (computational cost). These issues are major roadblocks to the trustworthy deployment of generative AI. By proposing a proactive, integrated approach during pre-training, the research has the potential to lead to major advancements in building safer, more ethical, and more efficient AI systems. Success would have substantial impact on safety-critical applications (healthcare, robotics) and contribute meaningfully to responsible AI development practices, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
