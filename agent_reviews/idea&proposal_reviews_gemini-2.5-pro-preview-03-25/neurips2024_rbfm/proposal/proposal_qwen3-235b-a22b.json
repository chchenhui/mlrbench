    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of reliability (hallucinations, fairness, bias), sustainability (resource efficiency), and preemptive strategies (pre-training integration). The methodology clearly builds upon the concepts outlined in the research idea (knowledge-guided contrastive learning, dynamic curation) and integrates techniques discussed in the literature review (Knowledge-CLIP, adversarial filtering, knowledge consistency scoring). The objectives and expected outcomes map directly onto the challenges highlighted in the task description."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure with defined objectives, a step-by-step methodology, and a clear experimental plan. Key concepts like the Knowledge Consistency Score (KCS) and the dual contrastive/generative objectives are explained. Equations and a placeholder diagram aid understanding. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise implementation details of some components (e.g., the cross-modal linker, the exact architecture, the initialization and adaptation specifics of tau_prune, the briefness of the 'Resource-Aware Training' section), but the overall research direction and approach are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While individual components like knowledge-guided pre-training (Knowledge-CLIP, REVEAL), adversarial filtering for bias, and dynamic dataset curation exist in the literature (as acknowledged and cited, including papers like #6, #7, #8, #9), the primary novelty lies in their specific *integration* into a unified framework targeting *both* reliability (factual correctness and fairness) and sustainability (computational efficiency) simultaneously during pre-training. The definition and use of the KCS combining factual and ethical scores for dynamic pruning is a specific contribution. However, it's more of a novel synthesis and application of existing ideas rather than a groundbreaking new technique. Literature review item #9 ('Efficient Multimodal Pretraining with Knowledge-Guided Contrastive Learning') appears very similar, potentially reducing the perceived novelty unless clear distinctions are emphasized."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, built upon established methods like contrastive learning (CLIP), knowledge graph embeddings (TransE), adversarial training, and Transformer models. The methodology is logically structured, and the use of equations clarifies parts of the approach. However, its soundness relies on several assumptions: the effectiveness of entity linking, the quality of the KG embeddings via TransE for capturing factual consistency, the capability of a fairness classifier to produce a meaningful EthicalScore, and the overall utility of the combined KCS for pruning. The interaction between multiple loss terms (contrastive, generative, adversarial) will require careful balancing. While technically plausible, the success hinges on the performance of these interconnected components."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant engineering and computational challenges. Required resources like large datasets (LAION, COCO) and KGs (Wikidata) are available, but processing and alignment require effort. Implementing and training the integrated framework (VLM, KG encoder, discriminator, dynamic curation logic) is complex and computationally intensive, requiring substantial hardware resources. The plan includes standard evaluation metrics and datasets, and acknowledges the need for efficiency monitoring (MLPerf). Achieving the targeted 30-40% cost reduction while maintaining quality is ambitious but suggests feasibility has been considered. The main risks involve implementation complexity and the need for extensive tuning."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses critical and timely challenges in multimodal AI: hallucinations, bias propagation, and the high computational cost of training large models. These issues are major roadblocks to trustworthy and widespread deployment, especially in high-stakes domains mentioned (healthcare, robotics). By proposing a preemptive, integrated solution during pre-training, the research has the potential to make substantial contributions to responsible AI development, directly aligning with the workshop's goals. Success would offer valuable design principles and could significantly impact how future foundational models are built, promoting both reliability and sustainability."
