        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task. It directly addresses the call for preemptive measures ('Adaptive Uncertainty-Driven Data Curation') applied during 'dataset curation and pre-training strategies'. It targets key issues mentioned in the call, including enhancing 'reliability' by tackling 'hallucinations' and 'fairness', identifying 'data quality' as a source of reliability concerns, and promoting 'responsibility and sustainability' by aiming to reduce 'data and computational demands'. The focus on multimodal data fits perfectly."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined, and the proposed two-stage approach (ensemble for uncertainty estimation, iterative filtering/reweighting) is understandable. The goals (dataset reduction, improved reliability) and evaluation metrics are specified. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of the 'compact multimodal encoders' or the specifics of the 'reweighting remaining examples to maximize semantic diversity', but the overall concept is well-defined and comprehensible."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While techniques like uncertainty estimation, ensemble methods, and data curation/filtering are established, their specific combination into an *adaptive, closed-loop curriculum* driven by uncertainty for *preemptive curation* of large-scale *multimodal* pretraining data, explicitly targeting reliability (hallucinations, fairness) and resource efficiency simultaneously, offers a novel perspective. It's a thoughtful synthesis and application of existing concepts to address current challenges in multimodal AI."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. Stage 1 relies on training a 'small ensemble' of 'compact' encoders, which suggests computational efficiency is considered. Finding a 'high-quality seed set' is a common challenge but generally achievable. Stage 2 involves iterative filtering and fine-tuning, which are standard ML practices. The core assumption is that the overhead of the curation process is offset by the savings from training on a smaller dataset. Evaluating hallucination, fairness, and resilience uses established benchmarks. The approach leverages existing methods in a structured way, making implementation practical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles critical and timely problems in large multimodal models: reliability (hallucinations, fairness, misinformation) and sustainability (high computational/data costs). By proposing a *preemptive* data curation strategy, it directly addresses the workshop's call to move beyond reactive fixes. If successful in reducing dataset size significantly while maintaining or improving model reliability and fairness, it could establish a valuable 'responsible design principle' and have a substantial impact on how future foundational models are developed."
