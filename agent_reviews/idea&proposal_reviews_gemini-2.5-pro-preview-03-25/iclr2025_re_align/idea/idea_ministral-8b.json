        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for contributions addressing how current alignment metrics have advanced understanding and what measurement approaches should be explored next, as well as how to develop more robust and generalizable measures. The idea directly tackles this by proposing 'Dynamic Representational Alignment Metrics' to overcome limitations of static metrics, aiming for robustness, generalizability, and applicability across domains, which perfectly matches the workshop's topical questions and central theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It outlines the motivation (limitations of static metrics), the core proposal (dynamic metrics), the methodology (dynamic feature extraction, adaptive metrics, validation, collaboration), expected outcomes, and potential impact. The concept of 'dynamic' and 'adaptive' metrics is understandable in context. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific algorithms or mathematical formulations for 'dynamic feature extraction' or 'adaptive metrics', but this level of detail is often elaborated in a full paper, not a brief idea description. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and easy to grasp."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While representational alignment is a known field, the explicit focus on developing *dynamic* metrics that *adapt* to system states and representations addresses a key limitation of many current, often static, approaches (like applying RSA/CKA at fixed time points). This temporal and adaptive dimension offers a fresh perspective compared to simply applying existing metrics to time-series data. It proposes a new class of measurement tools rather than just incremental improvements on static ones, aligning with the call for exploring 'next' measurement approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, but presents moderate challenges. Developing algorithms for dynamic feature extraction and adaptive metrics is conceptually sound, drawing on time-series analysis, online learning, and adaptive systems theory. However, designing metrics that robustly adapt their sensitivity based on 'system behavior and context' requires careful theoretical grounding and empirical validation. Accessing suitable dynamic data (e.g., neural recordings during learning, evolving model states) and performing rigorous simulations are standard but require effort. The interdisciplinary collaboration aspect is crucial and achievable. Overall, it's feasible but requires significant research effort, particularly in the metric design and validation phases."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Addressing the limitations of static alignment metrics, especially for inherently dynamic biological and increasingly adaptive artificial systems, is an important problem. Developing robust, dynamic metrics could lead to deeper insights into learning, adaptation, and interaction in intelligent systems. This directly contributes to the core questions of the Re-Align workshop regarding shared computations and improving measurement. Success could impact fields relying on system comparison, like neuroscience, AI development (especially continual learning), human-AI interaction, and BCI, fulfilling the potential impact outlined in the proposal."
