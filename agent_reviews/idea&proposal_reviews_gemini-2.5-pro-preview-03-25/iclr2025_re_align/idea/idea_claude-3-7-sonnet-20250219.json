        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of the Re-Align workshop by proposing a novel method to compare representations ('what measurement approaches should we explore next?'), focusing on intervention ('how can scientists and engineers intervene on this alignment?'), and aiming to understand shared computational strategies ('To what extent does representational alignment indicate shared computational strategies?'). It explicitly tackles the limitations of current metrics, a key point mentioned in the hackathon description, and proposes a more robust approach ('develop more robust and generalizable measures of alignment') that avoids reliance on ground truth, a central challenge in the field."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of current methods) and the core concept (causal intervention over correlation) are presented effectively. The proposed three-step methodology provides a good high-level overview. However, key operational details lack specificity, such as how 'minimal interventions' will be identified, how 'equivalent interventions' will be defined and applied across potentially disparate systems (e.g., ANN vs. brain), and precisely how 'analogous functional changes' will be measured without resorting back to similarity metrics. While the overall concept is understandable, these implementation details require further elaboration for complete clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly original and innovative. Shifting the focus from static, correlation-based similarity measures (like RSA, CKA) to dynamic, causal intervention-based functional equivalence represents a significant conceptual leap in representational alignment research. While causal analysis is used elsewhere, its specific application to define and measure alignment through systematic intervention-response mapping ('causal alignment space') appears novel. This approach promises a deeper understanding beyond surface-level similarities."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Defining and applying 'equivalent' interventions across vastly different systems (e.g., biological neurons vs. artificial units, different ANN architectures) is non-trivial and requires careful theoretical grounding and operationalization. Systematically identifying 'minimal' interventions and measuring 'analogous functional changes' robustly without relying on potentially problematic similarity metrics are also major hurdles. Furthermore, applying fine-grained interventions and measuring their effects might be difficult, especially in biological systems. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation requires overcoming substantial technical and methodological obstacles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental weakness in current representational alignment methods â€“ the reliance on potentially superficial correlations or unavailable ground truths. If successful, this causal framework could provide a much more meaningful and robust way to assess functional equivalence between representations in biological and artificial systems. This could lead to major advancements in understanding computational principles shared across intelligences, potentially impacting neuroscience, cognitive science, and the development of more interpretable and brain-inspired AI."
