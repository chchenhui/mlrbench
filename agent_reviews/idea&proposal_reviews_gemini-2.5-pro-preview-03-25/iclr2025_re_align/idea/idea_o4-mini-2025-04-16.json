        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme by proposing a method to 'intervene on this alignment' using a prototypical contrastive loss during DNN training. It also tackles several specific questions posed: proposing a novel measurement approach (the loss itself as a metric based on prototypes), aiming for more robust alignment measures (interpretable prototypes as anchors), and explicitly providing a mechanism to 'systematically increase' alignment. The focus on comparing brain and DNN representations fits perfectly within the scope of the Re-Align workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, highlighting the limitations of existing methods. The proposed two-stage method (prototype definition via joint clustering, alignment via contrastive loss) is presented logically. The core concepts of 'prototypes' and 'contrastive alignment' are understandable in this context. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise nature of the joint clustering algorithm or the exact mathematical formulation of the contrastive loss, but the overall research direction and methodology are clearly conveyed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While representational alignment, contrastive learning, and prototype-based methods exist independently, their combination in this specific manner for brain-DNN alignment appears novel. Defining prototypes jointly from brain and DNN data and then using them within a contrastive framework that serves as both an alignment metric and a training intervention offers a fresh perspective compared to standard post-hoc comparison techniques (like RSA or CCA) or typical self-supervised contrastive learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It requires paired neural and DNN activation data, which exists for certain stimulus sets (e.g., visual objects) but might constrain the choice of datasets or necessitate new data collection. Joint clustering of high-dimensional data and implementing custom loss functions for DNN training are standard techniques, albeit potentially complex. Evaluating neural predictivity, task transfer, and behavioral alignment are established methodologies. The main challenges lie in obtaining suitable paired data and ensuring the joint clustering yields meaningful, interpretable prototypes, but these seem surmountable within a research context."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses critical limitations of current alignment methods, namely their post-hoc nature and lack of direct intervention capabilities. By providing interpretable 'anchor' prototypes and a mechanism to actively steer DNN representations towards brain-like structures, it could lead to more robust, generalizable, and potentially more interpretable AI models. Success could yield meaningful contributions to understanding shared principles between biological and artificial intelligence and provide practical tools for building AI systems with human-aligned representations."
