    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the Re-Align workshop task, such as understanding when/why alignment occurs, developing intervention mechanisms (PCA loss), creating robust/generalizable metrics (prototype-based PAS, PDA), and exploring the implications of alignment (task performance, OOD). The methodology clearly operationalizes the research idea of using joint prototypes and contrastive learning. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the need for interpretable anchors, intervention mechanisms, and better metrics, positioning itself effectively within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from introduction and motivation to detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Key concepts like prototypes, joint clustering, and the PCA loss are explained, and mathematical formulations are provided. The experimental design is comprehensive and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of the 'modified prototype learning algorithm' beyond its objective function, but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed research. The objectives, methods, and rationale are generally presented with good clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While components like prototypical learning (Li et al., 2020) and contrastive methods exist, the specific synthesis proposed here – using jointly discovered brain-DNN prototypes as anchors within a contrastive loss framework to *both* measure *and* actively steer alignment during training – appears novel in the context of brain-DNN alignment. It moves beyond post-hoc analysis by integrating alignment as a regularizer. The literature review suggests related ideas (e.g., interpretable anchors, joint clustering, contrastive loss for alignment in hypothetical papers), but this proposal integrates them into a specific, coherent framework with a dual metric/intervention role, offering a fresh perspective compared to existing published work cited."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established concepts like contrastive learning, prototype learning, and representational similarity analysis. The mathematical formulations for Procrustes analysis and the PCA loss appear correct and well-justified within the contrastive learning paradigm. The experimental plan is comprehensive and includes relevant comparisons and ablation studies. However, the soundness hinges significantly on the effectiveness of the 'joint prototype discovery' phase and the 'modified prototype learning algorithm', which lacks detailed specification. The assumption that meaningful, stable prototypes can be jointly discovered across potentially very different representational spaces (DNN vs fMRI/EEG) requires empirical validation. While generally well-founded, this core methodological step needs further justification or detail to achieve higher soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Collecting new fMRI (n=20), EEG (n=30), and behavioral (n=100) data is highly resource-intensive (cost, time, infrastructure, ethics). Developing and validating the 'custom clustering algorithm' for joint prototype discovery represents a non-trivial research and engineering task. While the use of PyTorch and specified GPU resources (4xA100) is appropriate, the overall scope, particularly the data collection and custom algorithm development, makes the project ambitious and carries considerable risk regarding timely and successful execution within typical resource constraints. Relying on existing public neural datasets could improve feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in the current state of representational alignment research, namely the lack of interpretable alignment measures and effective intervention mechanisms, which are central themes in the task description. By proposing interpretable prototypes and a method to actively guide DNNs towards brain-like representations, the research has the potential to substantially advance our understanding of shared computational principles between biological and artificial intelligence. Success could lead to more human-compatible AI, improved BCI, and provide a valuable methodological contribution to the field."
