    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the Re-Align workshop's central theme of understanding and intervening on representational alignment, tackling specific questions about metrics, intervention mechanisms, and implications (behavioral alignment). The methodology is a detailed expansion of the research idea, incorporating the two-stage process of joint clustering for prototypes and contrastive alignment loss. Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself within the provided literature, citing relevant works (PCL, prototype/clustering ideas, alignment studies) and aiming to address the identified key challenges (interpretability, intervention, measurement, generalizability)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and gap analysis to the proposed solution, methodology, and expected outcomes. Objectives are specific and measurable. The core concepts (PCA, prototypes, joint clustering, contrastive loss) are explained well. The two-stage methodology is detailed with specific steps for implementation and evaluation, including baselines and metrics. While some implementation details (e.g., exact joint clustering technique) are left for exploration, the overall framework and rationale are articulated with high precision and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing existing concepts in a novel way to address specific gaps in representational alignment. While it builds upon Prototypical Contrastive Learning (Li et al., 2020) and recent ideas on using prototypes (Green & Black, 2024), joint clustering (Blue & Red, 2024), and contrastive loss for alignment (Yellow & Orange, 2024), the proposed PCA framework integrates these elements uniquely. Specifically, the two-stage approach—using joint clustering of brain-DNN data to define *brain-derived* prototypes and then using these as targets in a contrastive loss for *interpretable intervention* during DNN training—represents a distinct contribution beyond post-hoc analysis or simpler alignment regularizers. The novelty lies in this specific combination and its application to simultaneously improve interpretability and enable intervention."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established techniques like contrastive learning, clustering, RSA, and linear predictive coding. The proposed PCA loss function is a direct adaptation of a published method (PCL). The methodology includes appropriate steps for data handling, model training, and evaluation using standard metrics and baselines. The plan incorporates ablation studies to validate design choices. Potential challenges, such as the choice of joint clustering method and the definition/stability of prototypes, are implicitly acknowledged by suggesting exploration or defining the approach clearly (using neural centroids). The technical formulation of the loss appears correct. Minor uncertainties exist regarding the optimal way to perform joint clustering across different representational spaces, but the overall approach is methodologically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on publicly available datasets (images, neuroimaging data) and standard DNN models/libraries (ResNet, ViT, PyTorch/TensorFlow). The core techniques (clustering, contrastive learning, linear regression, RSA) are well-established. The main requirements are access to relevant datasets and sufficient computational resources for training and analysis, which are standard for this type of research. Potential risks include the effectiveness of joint clustering in finding meaningful prototypes and potential negative impacts of the PCA loss on task performance, but these are research risks rather than fundamental feasibility issues. The plan is realistic and implementation seems achievable with appropriate expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses critical, unresolved challenges in representational alignment, directly aligning with the goals of the Re-Align workshop. By tackling the lack of interpretability and intervention mechanisms in current alignment methods, it has the potential to substantially advance the field. The proposed PCA framework, if successful, would offer a novel tool for both measuring alignment interpretably (via prototypes) and actively steering AI representations towards biological ones. This could lead to more human-like AI (potentially improving robustness, generalization) and provide a computational framework for neuroscience to identify shared representational principles. The focus on interpretable anchors and intervention mechanisms makes the potential impact substantial."
