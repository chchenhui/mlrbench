    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the Re-Align workshop task (understanding, measuring, intervening on alignment, metrics, generalizability, implications) and the specific challenges identified in the literature review (interpretable anchors, generalizability, intervention). The methodology precisely implements the research idea (joint prototype extraction, prototypical contrastive loss). It explicitly aims to contribute code and benchmarks to the hackathon, fulfilling another aspect of the task description."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated, the methodology is detailed with logical steps, mathematical notation, and a clear experimental plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor details, such as the specifics of the joint clustering beyond K-means or the exact mechanism for updating prototypes during training, could be slightly elaborated, but these do not significantly hinder understanding. Overall, the proposal is exceptionally well-articulated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing existing concepts in a novel way. While it leverages Prototypical Contrastive Learning (PCL) and ideas from joint representation analysis mentioned in the literature, its specific application—using jointly derived brain-DNN prototypes within a contrastive framework to actively *steer* DNN representations towards neural alignment while providing interpretable anchors—is innovative. It goes beyond post-hoc analysis or standard unsupervised PCL by creating a targeted intervention mechanism based on brain data. The dual use of prototypes for measurement and intervention is a key novel aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, representational similarity, clustering) and established methods (PCA, CCA, K-means, InfoNCE loss). The proposed methodology, including joint prototype extraction and the prototypical contrastive loss formulation, is technically well-defined and justified. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse metrics (alignment, neural predictivity, task transfer, behavior, interpretability), and statistical analysis. Potential hyperparameters and design choices (K, tau, lambda, dimensionality reduction) are acknowledged."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on existing, accessible large-scale datasets (like NSD) and standard computational resources (GPU clusters) for DNN training and analysis. The core methods (clustering, contrastive learning, DNN fine-tuning) are well-established with available software libraries. The required expertise spans ML and neuroscience data analysis, which is appropriate for the target research community. The scope appears manageable for a research project, and the plan includes releasing code, indicating confidence in implementation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in representational alignment research, namely the lack of interpretable anchors and methods for direct intervention. By proposing a method that provides both, it has the potential to substantially advance the field. Success could lead to more brain-like, robust, and interpretable AI models, offer neuroscientists better tools for comparing representations, and inform cognitive science theories. The direct contribution to the Re-Align hackathon further enhances its practical significance to the community."
