    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the Re-Align workshop task description by proposing a method to understand alignment, develop robust metrics (via prototypes), and intervene (via contrastive loss). It precisely implements the two-stage approach outlined in the research idea (joint clustering for prototypes, contrastive loss for alignment/intervention). Furthermore, it explicitly positions itself against the challenges identified in the literature review (lack of interpretable anchors, generalizability, intervention mechanisms) and aims to provide solutions using concepts (prototypes, contrastive learning, joint clustering) mentioned in the reviewed papers. All objectives and methods directly stem from the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, and the methodology follows a logical two-stage process derived from the research idea. The structure is easy to follow. The core concepts of joint clustering, semantic prototypes, and prototypical contrastive loss are explained. The loss function is provided, although the precise definition of how a sample `i` maps to its prototype `z_i*` (presumably the centroid of the cluster `i` belongs to after the joint clustering stage) could be slightly more explicit. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are clearly listed. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and understandable with only minor points requiring potential refinement during execution."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several recent ideas in a novel way for the specific problem of brain-DNN representational alignment. While Prototypical Contrastive Learning (PCL) exists (Li et al., 2020), its application here uses brain-derived prototypes obtained via *joint* clustering of brain and DNN data, serving as both a metric and an *intervention* mechanism for alignment. This specific combination – joint clustering for shared prototypes + prototypical contrastive loss for explicit brain-DNN alignment intervention – appears novel, building upon but distinct from the cited works focusing on unsupervised learning (Li et al.), general alignment factors (Muttenthaler et al.), or separate uses of prototypes/joint clustering/contrastive loss (Green et al., Blue et al., Yellow et al.). It's not a completely new paradigm but offers a fresh and potentially powerful combination of techniques tailored to the task."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established methodologies: clustering (k-means, etc.), dimensionality reduction (PCA/t-SNE), contrastive learning principles, and standard evaluation metrics for neural predictivity and task performance. The core idea of using shared prototypes derived from joint clustering as anchors for alignment is conceptually sound. The proposed contrastive loss function is a plausible mechanism for encouraging alignment towards these prototypes. The methodology is generally well-defined, and the technical formulation of the loss, while slightly unconventional (squared difference vs. log-sum-exp), is mathematically valid. The main assumption is that meaningful shared prototypes can be extracted via joint clustering, which is empirically testable and a reasonable hypothesis to investigate."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but depends significantly on data availability. Accessing or collecting high-quality, paired DNN activation and neural response data (fMRI/EEG) across a suitable stimulus set is crucial and can be resource-intensive if new data collection is required. Assuming such data is available (e.g., from existing public datasets or collaborations), the remaining steps are standard ML practices: feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, clustering, implementing a custom loss function, and fine-tuning/training DNNs. These require standard computational resources (GPUs) and expertise commonly found in ML/neuroscience labs. The primary risk lies in the data acquisition/access and the empirical success of the joint clustering step."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses critical, unresolved questions in representational alignment, a key area at the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and cognitive science. It directly tackles challenges highlighted in the task description and literature review, such as the need for interpretable alignment measures, generalizability, and methods for intervention. By proposing interpretable 'semantic prototypes' as anchors and a contrastive loss for intervention, the research could lead to a deeper understanding of brain-DNN differences/similarities and enable the development of AI systems with more human-like representations. Success could yield impactful methodological advances and contribute significantly to bridging the gap between biological and artificial intelligence, aligning well with the goals of the Re-Align workshop."
