        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses the workshop topic 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability'. It focuses on the challenge of AI-generated responses undermining assessment integrity, a key issue arising from the proliferation of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) mentioned in the workshop description. The proposal aims to develop a method using generative AI (specifically, LFMs within a contrastive framework) to ensure accountability, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's scope and themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-defined. The motivation (assessment integrity), the core problem (LFM misuse, detector limitations), the proposed solution (SecureED framework, contrastive learning, multimodal data, adversarial fine-tuning), and the evaluation plan are clearly articulated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact implementation details of the contrastive learning setup or the specific 'domain-specific features', but the overall concept and goals are readily understandable for a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While AI-generated text detection is an existing field, this idea offers notable originality. The novelty lies in the proposed *SecureED* framework itself, specifically the combination of contrastive learning leveraging LFMs, the focus on multimodal educational data (text, code, math), the emphasis on high-order thinking tasks (which are often harder to detect reliably), and the explicit strategy of using adversarial samples and domain-specific features for robustness and cross-domain generalizability within the educational assessment context. It's a novel application and refinement of existing techniques for a specific, challenging domain."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The technical components (contrastive learning, LFM fine-tuning, adversarial training) are established ML techniques, making the core idea technically feasible. However, significant practical challenges exist. Acquiring or generating large-scale, diverse, and representative datasets of human vs. AI responses across multiple modalities (text, code, math) and thinking levels is difficult. Achieving high robustness against sophisticated evasion tactics (paraphrasing, style transfer) and ensuring generalizability across different subjects, assessment types, and evolving LFMs is inherently challenging and represents a major hurdle. Considerable effort and resources would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant and timely problem. Maintaining academic integrity and the validity of educational assessments in the face of powerful generative AI is a critical challenge for educational institutions globally. A robust, reliable, and fair system for detecting AI-generated responses, especially for high-stakes assessments involving complex reasoning, would have a major impact on assessment practices, potentially enabling the continued use of diverse assessment formats while mitigating AI misuse. The focus on accountability and preventing false accusations adds to its significance."
