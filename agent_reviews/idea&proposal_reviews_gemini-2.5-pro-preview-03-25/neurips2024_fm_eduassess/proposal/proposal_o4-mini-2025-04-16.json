    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' and 'Trustworthy AI (Fairness, Explainability, Privacy)'. It faithfully expands on the 'SecureED' research idea, detailing the contrastive learning approach, multimodal data handling, adversarial robustness, and open-source goals. Furthermore, it effectively positions itself within the provided literature, citing relevant contrastive learning methods (ConDA, DeTeCtive, WhosAI), acknowledging limitations of existing tools (GPTZero, Originality.AI, Copyleaks), and aiming to tackle the key challenges identified in the review (accuracy, generalizability, evasion, explainability, integration)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The methodology section provides substantial detail, including model components, data handling, loss functions (with equations), training protocols, and evaluation metrics. The structure is easy to follow. Minor points, such as the precise representation and processing of 'diagram descriptions', could be slightly more explicit, but overall clarity is excellent."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While using contrastive learning for AI text detection is established in the literature (e.g., ConDA, DeTeCtive), the novelty lies in: 1) Applying it to a multimodal educational context (text, code, math, diagrams). 2) Explicitly integrating domain adaptation via an adversarial discriminator to handle subject/question-type variance alongside contrastive learning. 3) Systematically incorporating diverse adversarial training techniques (paraphrasing, back-translation, substitution) within the contrastive framework's negative sampling. 4) Combining these elements with explainability (SHAP) into a comprehensive framework specifically for educational assessments. It's a novel synthesis and application rather than a fundamentally new algorithm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established machine learning techniques like contrastive learning (MoCo-style, InfoNCE), domain adaptation (Gradient Reversal Layer), adversarial training, and explainability (SHAP). The technical formulations for the core losses are correctly presented. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines (commercial tools, ML classifiers, recent research papers), diverse test sets (in-domain, cross-domain, adversarial), and appropriate metrics (accuracy, AUC, robustness, fairness, explainability). The methodology is generally well-defined, though the specifics of handling 'diagram descriptions' within a Transformer framework could be elaborated further for full rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. While the ML techniques are standard, acquiring diverse, large-scale, *real* student data across multiple modalities (text, code, math, diagrams) and subjects, potentially from multiple institutions, poses significant logistical and privacy hurdles. Generating LFM responses and adversarial variants is feasible but computationally intensive. Training the complex model (dual Transformers, large negative queue, adversarial components) requires substantial GPU resources. Building and deploying the API is standard MLOps but adds complexity. The feasibility hinges heavily on data access and computational budget, making it ambitious."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely challenge: maintaining academic integrity in the face of increasingly sophisticated AI generation tools, a major concern for educators and assessment bodies worldwide. A robust, generalizable, and explainable detector like SecureED could restore confidence in assessments, enable safer adoption of AI learning tools, and set standards for AI accountability in education. The planned open-source dataset and API would be valuable community resources. The focus on multimodality and adversarial robustness tackles key weaknesses of current approaches."
