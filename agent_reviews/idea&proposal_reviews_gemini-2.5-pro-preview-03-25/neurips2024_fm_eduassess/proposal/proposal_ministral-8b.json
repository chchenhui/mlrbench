    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the task description, specifically addressing the workshop topic 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability'. It faithfully expands on the provided research idea, detailing the motivation, methodology (*SecureED* framework), data, evaluation, and impact. It also clearly positions itself within the context of the literature review, acknowledging limitations of existing tools (papers 6-10) and leveraging recent techniques like contrastive learning (papers 1, 2, 4) to address identified challenges (accuracy, generalizability, evasion). The slight inconsistency is the title mentioning 'Preventing' while the proposal focuses almost entirely on 'Detecting', but the core alignment is strong."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear and well-structured, with understandable objectives, research questions, and a logical methodology outline (Data Collection, Model Development, Evaluation, Integration). The significance and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. However, some technical details could be more precise. For instance, the specific LFM architecture to be used isn't mentioned, the exact mechanism for pairing samples (AI vs. Human) in the contrastive loss needs clarification, and the operationalization of 'domain-specific features' like 'reasoning coherence' and 'creativity patterns' remains vague. Despite these points needing refinement, the overall proposal is comprehensible."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The core technique, contrastive learning for AI text detection, is not entirely novel, as shown in the literature review (papers 1, 2, 4). The novelty lies primarily in the specific application to the educational assessment domain, the proposed use of a multimodal dataset (text, code, math), the focus on high-order thinking tasks, and the explicit goal of incorporating domain-specific features like reasoning coherence and creativity patterns. Additionally, targeting robustness against evasion tactics and cross-domain generalizability specifically for educational assessments, along with providing an open-source API and integration guidelines, adds practical novelty. It's more of a novel application and refinement of existing ideas rather than a groundbreaking new method."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal's motivation and overall approach (using contrastive learning to distinguish distributions based on features learned by LFMs) are conceptually sound and relevant to the problem. The evaluation plan includes appropriate metrics and robustness checks. However, there is a significant flaw in the technical formulation: the provided contrastive loss function definition (y_{ij} = 1 if i \\\\neq j) appears incorrect for the task of distinguishing between two classes (AI vs. Human) or learning representations where similar items attract and dissimilar ones repel. This mathematical error undermines the rigor of the proposed core method. Furthermore, the description of how abstract concepts like 'reasoning coherence' and 'creativity patterns' will be quantified and integrated as features lacks detail, reducing the methodological soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "Implementing a contrastive learning framework with LFMs is technically feasible using existing tools. However, collecting a large, diverse, high-quality, and accurately labeled multimodal dataset (text, code, math) across various subjects presents a significant challenge. Effectively operationalizing and integrating 'reasoning coherence' and 'creativity patterns' is complex. Achieving high robustness against evolving evasion tactics is inherently difficult. While the evaluation and API development are feasible, the data collection and achieving the desired level of robust performance pose considerable implementation challenges and risks, likely requiring substantial resources not detailed in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and timely issue in education: maintaining academic integrity in the face of increasingly capable generative AI. The potential impact is very high. A robust and reliable tool for detecting AI-generated responses in assessments would be invaluable for educators and institutions, enabling the responsible adoption of AI technologies while safeguarding assessment validity. The focus on robustness, generalizability, and practical integration (API, guidelines) directly addresses major shortcomings of current solutions, potentially leading to substantial advancements in assessment security and fostering trust in the educational ecosystem."
