    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses a key topic of the workshop ('Generative AI for assessment security and accountability'), elaborates coherently on the research idea (SecureED framework using contrastive learning), and explicitly builds upon the provided literature (ConDA, DeTeCtive, Najjar et al., etc.). It acknowledges and aims to overcome the limitations of existing tools and challenges identified in the literature review (accuracy, generalization, evasion, explainability). There are no significant inconsistencies."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, methodology (including dataset, model architecture with formula, adversarial training, evaluation metrics, baselines), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow, and the language is precise. Minor details regarding the implementation of explainability features could be slightly more specific, but overall clarity is excellent."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While using contrastive learning for AI text detection exists (as shown in the literature review with ConDA, DeTeCtive, WhosAI), the novelty lies in its specific application and extension to the multimodal educational assessment domain (text, code, math), which is less explored. Combining contrastive learning with domain-adversarial training (GRL) for cross-subject generalization and tailored adversarial training against educational evasion tactics adds innovative aspects. The focus on high-order reasoning tasks and education-specific explainability features further distinguishes it."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, transformers, domain adaptation, adversarial training) and cites relevant, recent literature. The proposed methodology, including the triplet loss formulation, evaluation plan (metrics, baselines, cross-validation, ablation studies), and adversarial robustness strategy, is well-justified and technically appropriate. Minor weaknesses include the assumption of large-scale data access and the need for empirical validation of the proposed explainability features."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The core model development using contrastive learning and adversarial training is feasible with adequate computational resources and expertise. However, the plan to curate a very large (500k+) multimodal dataset involving partnerships with educational platforms is ambitious and poses significant risks related to data access, privacy, and labeling effort. Similarly, deploying it as a real-time API with an explainability dashboard integrated into LMS platforms is a substantial engineering task beyond the core research scope, adding to the feasibility concerns."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: maintaining academic integrity in educational assessments amidst the rise of powerful generative AI tools. A robust, generalizable, and explainable detection system like SecureED could have a major positive impact on assessment validity, fairness, the responsible adoption of AI in education, and policy development. The focus on multimodal assessment and higher-order reasoning tasks increases its relevance."
