    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' and tackles key challenges like detection reliability and evasion mentioned in the literature review. It faithfully expands upon the 'SecureED' research idea, detailing the proposed contrastive learning framework, multimodal data approach, and evaluation strategy. The methodology explicitly references and builds upon several papers from the literature review (ConDA, DeTeCtive, WhosAI, Kirchenbauer et al.), demonstrating a strong connection to prior work and addressing the identified gaps (e.g., limitations of existing tools like GPTZero, Copyleaks)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are logically structured and articulated. The core concepts like contrastive learning, domain adaptation, and adversarial training are explained. The methodology section provides considerable detail on data collection, model architecture, loss functions, and evaluation metrics. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise implementation details of the multimodal fusion mechanism and the novel education-specific features (reasoning coherence, knowledge consistency, creativity metrics), which could benefit from further elaboration, but the overall proposal is highly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using contrastive learning for AI text detection is established (as acknowledged by citing ConDA, DeTeCtive, WhosAI), the novelty lies in its specific application and extension to the complex, multimodal domain of educational assessments (including text, math, code, visual reasoning). Key novel aspects include the integration of education-specific features (reasoning coherence, knowledge consistency, creativity patterns) within the contrastive framework and the focus on high-order thinking tasks across diverse subjects. The combination of contrastive learning, domain adaptation, adversarial training, and potentially watermarking specifically tailored for educational assessment integrity represents a fresh approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It builds upon established ML techniques like contrastive learning, domain adaptation (ConDA), multi-level feature extraction (DeTeCtive), and adversarial training. The use of pre-trained language models (RoBERTa) and a dual-encoder architecture is appropriate. The mathematical formulations for the core loss functions and proposed metrics are provided and appear conceptually correct. The comprehensive evaluation plan, including cross-domain testing, robustness checks, and comparisons, adds to the rigor. Minor weaknesses include the potential complexity of robustly implementing and validating the novel education-specific metrics across diverse domains and the inherent challenges in multimodal data fusion."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal's feasibility presents some challenges. The primary concern is the data collection effort: acquiring a large-scale (100k+ pairs), diverse, multimodal dataset with verified human/AI authorship across multiple subjects, including adversarial examples and human attempts to mimic AI, is extremely ambitious and resource-intensive. Collaboration with institutions can be complex. Secondly, the model itself is highly complex, integrating multimodal encoders, domain adaptation, adversarial training, and specialized feature extractors, requiring significant computational resources and expertise. While technically plausible, successfully implementing all components and achieving the stated performance targets within a typical research project timeline seems challenging."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: ensuring the integrity of educational assessments in the era of powerful generative AI. This is a critical issue facing educators and institutions globally. A successful outcome (a robust, reliable, and explainable detection tool) would have a major impact on preserving assessment validity, enabling responsible AI integration in education, maintaining trust in credentials, and potentially informing policy. The focus on diverse assessment types, high-order thinking, and evasion resistance further enhances its potential impact. The plan for open-source resources also maximizes potential reach."
