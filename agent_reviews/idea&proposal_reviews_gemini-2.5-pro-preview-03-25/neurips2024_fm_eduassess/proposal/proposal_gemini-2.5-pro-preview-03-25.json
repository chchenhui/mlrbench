    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop topic 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' and 'Trustworthy AI'. It systematically expands on the core research idea of using contrastive learning (SecureED) for detecting AI responses in multimodal assessments. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates findings and addresses gaps identified in the literature review, such as the limitations of current detectors (Elkhatat et al., 2023; Weber-Wulff et al., 2023), the need for robustness against evasion (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023; Beam, 2023), and the potential of contrastive learning methods (Bhattacharjee et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024; La Cava et al., 2024)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The research design, data collection steps, model architecture, and evaluation plan are detailed. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as the initial confusion and self-correction in the contrastive loss formulation (though the final version is clear) and potentially more specific details on handling the nuances of mathematical reasoning modality. Overall, the proposal communicates its intentions effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory originality. While using contrastive learning for AI text detection is established in the literature (as cited), the novelty lies in its specific application to multimodal (text, code, math) educational assessment responses, particularly those requiring higher-order thinking. The combination of contrastive learning, domain-specific features, and adversarial fine-tuning tailored for this challenging educational context represents a novel approach. However, it builds significantly on existing methods rather than introducing a fundamentally new detection paradigm. The creation of a dedicated multimodal dataset for this specific task also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, transformer models) and established methodologies (Siamese networks, InfoNCE loss adapted for supervised contrastive learning, adversarial fine-tuning, standard evaluation metrics). The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, ablation studies, and robustness/generalizability checks. The plan incorporates ethical considerations for data collection and addresses explainability (Key Challenge #4). The technical formulation of the contrastive loss, despite an initial misstep that was corrected, settles on an appropriate approach. The methodology is well-justified and aligned with current best practices in the field."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning data collection. Curating a comprehensive, multimodal dataset of paired human/AI responses for diverse subjects and higher-order thinking tasks, while ensuring ethical compliance (IRB approval, anonymization), is highly ambitious and resource-intensive. Generating varied and effective adversarial AI samples also requires careful execution. While the modeling aspects (contrastive learning, fine-tuning) use existing techniques and are technically feasible, they demand substantial computational resources. The overall scope is broad, potentially straining resources and timelines. Successful execution depends heavily on overcoming the data acquisition hurdle."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely challenge ('Generative AI for assessment security and accountability') directly relevant to the workshop call and the broader educational community facing the rise of LFMs. Developing a robust, reliable, and explainable method for detecting AI-generated assessment responses has the potential to safeguard academic integrity, foster trust, and enable the responsible adoption of AI in education. The focus on multimodal responses and higher-order thinking tasks tackles a particularly challenging aspect of the problem. Success would yield valuable tools and insights for educators, institutions, and researchers."
