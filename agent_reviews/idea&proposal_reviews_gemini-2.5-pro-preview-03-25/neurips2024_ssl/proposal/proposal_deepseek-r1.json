        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for bridging theory and practice in SSL, focusing on the theoretical foundations (information theory) for auxiliary task design. The methodology precisely operationalizes the research idea of information disentanglement via MI maximization/minimization. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, referencing concepts like MI estimation, disentanglement, and specific methods (Cl-InfoNCE), while aiming to tackle the identified key challenges like theoretical understanding and effective disentanglement."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure, defines key concepts (invariant/variant information, MI objectives) mathematically, and outlines the methodology and experimental plan comprehensibly. The core idea is easy to grasp. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise handling of nuisance variables across all data types or a deeper justification for the choice of MI estimators, but these do not significantly hinder understanding. The overall presentation is clear and professional."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing existing concepts (MI maximization for invariance, MI minimization for disentanglement) into a unified, principled framework for designing SSL auxiliary tasks. While the literature review indicates related work on MI and disentanglement in SSL (e.g., papers 2, 3, 6, 8, 10), the proposal's novelty lies in framing this combination as a general design principle applicable across modalities and aiming to derive new tasks systematically. It offers a fresh perspective on unifying heuristic approaches, distinguishing it from prior work focused on specific applications or narrower aspects of MI/disentanglement."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in information theory and established SSL principles. The proposed methodology employs standard and justified techniques for MI estimation (InfoNCE lower bound, variational upper bound) and combines them into a coherent loss function. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant baselines, metrics, statistical analysis, and ablation studies. While achieving the stated 'formal guarantees' might be challenging and the practical accuracy of MI estimators can vary, the core theoretical framework and methodological approach are robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Implementing the core components (encoders, MI estimators) is standard practice in ML research. Required resources (datasets, compute) are typical for SSL experiments. However, challenges exist in reliably estimating MI, especially the disentanglement term, and in designing augmentations with well-defined, controllable nuisance variables across diverse data types (vision, language, time-series). Tuning the trade-off parameter Î» will also require careful experimentation. These challenges are manageable but introduce moderate implementation risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses a critical gap in SSL: the lack of principled, theory-driven design for auxiliary tasks. Success would provide a unifying framework, potentially leading to more interpretable, robust, and sample-efficient SSL methods. By offering a systematic way to tailor tasks to specific data or downstream needs (like robustness), it could have a substantial impact on SSL research across various domains and improve the reliability of SSL in high-stakes applications. The potential to bridge the theory-practice gap in a major ML paradigm makes the work highly impactful."
