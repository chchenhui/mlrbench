    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the task description: the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding in SSL, particularly concerning auxiliary task design. The proposal meticulously follows the research idea of using information disentanglement (maximizing invariant MI, minimizing variant MI via augmentation parameters) as a principled approach. It effectively integrates concepts and challenges mentioned in the literature review (e.g., disentanglement, MI estimation, balancing objectives) and positions the work within that context. The objectives, methodology, and significance sections consistently reinforce the core theme and goals outlined in the initial inputs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a strong background and problem statement, moving to a clearly articulated proposed solution and objectives, detailing the methodology, and outlining expected outcomes. The core concepts (information disentanglement, mutual information, invariant/variant information, nuisance variables V_i) are explained well. The mathematical formulation of the objective function and the descriptions of proposed algorithms (ID-CL, ID-NCL) are precise. The experimental plan is detailed and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities might exist around the exact implementation details of V_i for all possible augmentations, but overall, the proposal is immediately understandable with minimal need for clarification."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing existing concepts (MI maximization in SSL, MI minimization for disentanglement) into a unified framework for *principled design* of SSL auxiliary tasks. The specific focus on disentangling augmentation parameters (V_i) to potentially improve robustness, and the explicit derivation of both contrastive (ID-CL) and non-contrastive (ID-NCL) tasks from this single framework, constitutes a novel contribution. However, the literature review indicates several recent papers ([6, 8, 10]) exploring similar ideas (MI objectives for disentanglement in SSL, minimizing nuisance info). While the proposal frames this as a more comprehensive, generative framework, the core components are not entirely unprecedented, making it less groundbreaking but still a valuable and innovative direction."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in information theory, a solid theoretical foundation. The proposed methodology leverages established techniques for MI estimation in deep learning (InfoNCE, CLUB) and standard SSL practices (architectures, evaluation protocols). The mathematical formulation of the core objective seems correct, and the derivation of specific loss functions is logical. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines and evaluation metrics (robustness, disentanglement). Potential weaknesses lie in the known challenges of MI estimation (accuracy, variance) and the potential complexity of optimizing the dual objective function (balancing \\\\alpha and \\\\beta), but these are acknowledged research challenges rather than fundamental flaws in the approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current deep learning technology, standard datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet), and computational resources typically available for SSL research. The implementation involves combining existing SSL frameworks with known MI estimators (like CLUB) and modifying data pipelines to track augmentation parameters (V_i), which is technically achievable. The experimental plan is well-defined and uses standard benchmarks. The main risks involve the empirical performance of the MI estimators and the potential difficulty in tuning the combined loss function, but these are manageable research risks rather than insurmountable obstacles. The scope, focusing initially on vision, is realistic."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses a critical and widely recognized gap in SSL: the lack of theoretical grounding for designing effective auxiliary tasks. By proposing a principled, information-theoretic framework, it directly tackles the core theme of the workshop (bridging theory and practice). Success could lead to a deeper understanding of *why* SSL works, potentially yield new SSL algorithms with improved robustness and transferability, and provide a systematic methodology for designing tasks tailored to specific downstream requirements. This research has substantial potential to advance the field of representation learning and influence future work in SSL across various domains."
