        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions on 'Theoretical foundations of SSL', 'Theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks in SSL', and 'Information theory and SSL'. The idea directly proposes a theory-driven framework using information theory (mutual information and disentanglement) to design auxiliary SSL tasks, addressing these topics precisely. It aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, which is the central theme of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (heuristic vs. principled design), the core concept (information disentanglement via MI objectives), the proposed mechanism (maximizing inter-view MI, minimizing intra-view MI w.r.t. nuisances), and the evaluation plan are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It clearly explains the 'what', 'why', and 'how' of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using information theory (like MI) to analyze or motivate SSL isn't entirely new (e.g., InfoNCE links to MI estimation), the specific proposal to frame auxiliary task design around *explicitly* disentangling invariant and variant information via simultaneous MI maximization and minimization objectives offers a fresh, structured perspective. Deriving novel loss functions directly from this principle, rather than post-hoc justification of existing ones, constitutes a significant innovative step."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The theoretical concepts (mutual information, SSL frameworks) are established. However, accurately estimating and optimizing the proposed mutual information objectives, especially the minimization term involving nuisance variables in high-dimensional spaces, can be technically demanding. It likely requires sophisticated estimators (e.g., variational bounds) or clever approximations. Standard evaluation protocols are feasible, but the core optimization problem requires careful technical execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a fundamental limitation in SSL â€“ the predominantly heuristic nature of auxiliary task design. Providing a principled, theory-driven framework could lead to a deeper understanding of why SSL works and enable the systematic design of more effective, robust, or fair representations tailored to specific downstream needs. Success could significantly advance SSL methodology and its applications."
