        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for bridging the gap between theory and practice in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), exploring theoretical foundations, theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks, the role of information theory, and applications in specific domains like healthcare/neuroscience. The proposed idea directly addresses all these points by framing SSL through the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle (theory), analyzing existing methods and proposing new MI-optimized tasks (theory-driven design, practice), leveraging mutual information (information theory), and motivating the work by the need for trustworthy representations in critical domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (lack of theoretical grounding in SSL) is explicitly stated. The core concept (framing SSL as an IB problem using MI optimization) is clearly articulated. The proposed methodology is broken down into three understandable steps: analysis, design, and validation. The expected outcomes (unified framework, practical algorithm) are specific and logical consequences of the proposed work. The language used is precise and technical, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While the connection between Information Bottleneck and representation learning (including some SSL aspects) has been explored before, this proposal offers novelty in its specific aims: 1) Systematically analyzing a range of *existing* popular SSL methods (contrastive, masked) through the IB lens to quantify their *implicit* MI trade-offs. 2) Designing *novel augmentation-agnostic* auxiliary tasks that *explicitly* optimize IB objectives using tractable MI estimators. 3) A strong focus on bridging the theory-practice gap with validation across diverse modalities. It's not introducing IB itself, but its structured application to unify, analyze, and improve current SSL practices offers a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Analyzing existing methods theoretically is standard. Designing new tasks based on IB principles is achievable, leveraging existing work on tractable MI estimators (e.g., MINE, InfoNCE bounds, NWJ). While accurate MI estimation and optimization in high dimensions can be challenging, it's an active area of research with available techniques. The validation phase involves standard ML experimental procedures. The main potential hurdle is the practical effectiveness and stability of the MI optimization process within complex SSL training pipelines, but it seems achievable with current methods and moderate effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and widely recognized limitation of current SSL research â€“ the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding. Providing a unifying theoretical framework like IB could lead to principled design of auxiliary tasks, better understanding of learned representations, and potentially improved sample complexity. Success could reduce reliance on heuristic approaches and enable more trustworthy SSL applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare, which is a major potential impact. Improving representation efficiency is also a significant goal."
