    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for methods to '(efficiently) attribute model outputs back to specific training examples' under the 'Data attribution and selection' topic. This idea directly proposes an efficient method for data attribution using a meta-learned proxy, addressing the core need for scalable attribution highlighted in the task description and workshop theme."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly states the motivation (computational cost of existing methods), the core proposal (meta-learning a proxy model), the inputs/outputs of the proxy, and the expected outcomes. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific architecture of the proxy or the exact meta-learning setup, but the overall concept and approach are well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While data attribution and influence function approximation are existing research areas, the specific approach of using meta-learning to train a separate, lightweight proxy model that predicts influence scores based on example embeddings (gradients, activations) appears relatively novel. It combines existing concepts (meta-learning, influence functions, embeddings) in a fresh way to tackle the efficiency challenge."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Precomputing influence scores using traditional methods for the meta-training subset can still be computationally intensive, depending on the required subset size for good generalization. Designing an effective proxy architecture and meta-learning strategy, and ensuring the proxy generalizes accurately from the subset to the full dataset and potentially different model behaviors, are non-trivial engineering and research tasks. Success depends on the trade-off between the cost of meta-training and the efficiency/accuracy gain of the proxy."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Efficient data attribution at scale is a critical bottleneck for understanding, debugging, and improving large models, as emphasized by the task description. A successful implementation could provide a valuable tool for dataset curation, bias detection, identifying data leakage, and generally increasing transparency, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the task."
