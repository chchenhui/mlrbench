    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for work on 'Concept-based interpretability,' asking 'Can we attribute predictions to human-identifiable concepts? Can we attribute these concepts or other biases to subnetworks inside a DNN?'. The proposed idea directly addresses this by developing a framework to automatically identify, map, and track concepts within models, attribute behavior to concept combinations, and potentially locate responsible network regions. It fits perfectly within the 'Trained models' topic and aligns with the overall goal of 'advancing our understanding of model behavior attribution'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It outlines a specific process: activation clustering, correlation with a concept dataset, tracking concept transformations, and visualization for attribution. The motivation and intended outcomes (identifying biases, targeted interventions) are clearly stated. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the clustering technique, the nature and creation of the 'curated concept dataset,' and the precise method for correlating clusters to concepts, but the overall framework and goals are well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like activation clustering and concept attribution exist (e.g., TCAV, Network Dissection), the proposed framework integrates them in a specific way: unsupervised clustering across layers, automated mapping to a curated concept dataset, and explicitly tracking the *transformation* of these concept representations through the network to build 'concept activation paths'. This synthesis, aiming to bridge mechanistic and high-level concept interpretability by mapping concept evolution, offers a fresh perspective compared to methods focusing only on input-output concept attribution or static concept identification."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using existing techniques. Activation clustering, concept attribution methods, and visualization tools are established areas. However, practical challenges exist. Creating a comprehensive 'curated concept dataset' requires significant effort. Ensuring robust correlation between abstract activation clusters and human-defined concepts can be difficult. Scaling the analysis (especially activation extraction and clustering) to very large models will require efficient implementations and potentially significant computational resources. While achievable, it requires careful engineering and potentially methodological refinements for scalability and robustness."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Understanding and interpreting complex 'black-box' models is a critical challenge in ML safety, fairness, and reliability. Attributing model behavior to human-understandable concepts, as proposed, would provide valuable insights for debugging, identifying biases, ensuring alignment, and potentially improving models through targeted interventions. Successfully bridging mechanistic details (activations) with conceptual understanding addresses a key gap in interpretability research and could lead to meaningful advancements in trustworthy AI."
