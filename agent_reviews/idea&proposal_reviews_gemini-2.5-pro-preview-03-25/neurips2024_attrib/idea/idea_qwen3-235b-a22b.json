        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Data' topic, specifically 'Data attribution and selection' and 'Data leakage/contamination', focusing on how training data composition (authentic vs. synthetic/LLM-generated) influences model biases and the challenge of data feedback loops. It aims to attribute model behavior (bias) back to controllable factors (data sources) at scale, which is the core theme of the workshop task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core proposal (randomized influence analysis, source tagging, perturbation, causal mediation), and expected outcomes are well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of the randomized estimators and the specific causal mediation model setup at scale, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While data attribution and causal inference are existing fields, the proposed combination of randomized perturbations *during* training, specifically targeting data *source* contributions (clean vs. contaminated) to *bias* metrics using causal mediation analysis, and aiming for scalability via efficient estimators, offers a fresh perspective. It specifically tackles the timely issue of LLM-generated data feedback loops in a potentially innovative way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Tagging data sources is practical. However, integrating randomized perturbations/ablations into large-scale training pipelines requires significant engineering effort and computational overhead. The reliance on 'efficient randomized estimators' and 'distributed batches' acknowledges the scale challenge, but their practical effectiveness and cost need empirical validation. Causal mediation analysis also requires careful assumptions and validation. It's ambitious but plausible within a well-resourced research setting."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of understanding and mitigating bias amplification from training on mixed data sources, particularly synthetic data generated by LLMs. Developing scalable methods for tracing bias to data provenance would be a major advancement for responsible AI, data governance, and building more robust models. The potential guidelines for data pruning could directly influence future ML development practices."
