        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on attributing model behavior to trained model subcomponents using concept-based interpretability. It systematically elaborates on the research idea, detailing the proposed framework for concept mapping. Furthermore, it acknowledges key challenges identified in the literature review (e.g., dataset dependence, concept learnability, alignment) and proposes specific methodological steps (unsupervised clustering combined with small labeled dataset mapping) to mitigate them, positioning the work effectively within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology is broken down into logical stages (A-D) with specific algorithmic steps and mathematical notation. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are also clearly outlined. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as the precise method for selecting the number of clusters (K_ell) beyond mentioning silhouette analysis, the exact definition of the 'small' concept dataset size relative to complexity, and potentially more detail on the linear probe training specifics. However, the overall structure and language make the proposal readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like activation clustering, concept probes (related to TCAV), and interventions exist, the novelty lies in their specific integration into a cohesive framework. Key innovative aspects include: 1) Combining unsupervised discovery of 'latent concepts' via clustering across multiple layers with supervised mapping to human concepts using a *small* curated dataset, aiming to reduce reliance on large probe datasets. 2) Tracking the evolution of these concept activations across layers. 3) Proposing a targeted intervention mechanism directly linked to these discovered and mapped concepts. This synthesis offers a fresh perspective distinct from prior work like ConceptDistil (distillation-based) or methods relying solely on pre-defined concepts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established techniques like activation extraction, K-means clustering, and linear probing. The methodology is generally well-defined, and the mathematical formulations are present and appear correct. However, some aspects require further justification or empirical validation: the choice of K-means for potentially complex activation manifolds, the sensitivity of concept mapping to the Top-M selection and AUC threshold, and the effectiveness of the specific intervention operator heuristic (interpolating towards cluster centroids). The evaluation plan includes appropriate metrics and baselines, strengthening the soundness, but the success of the core method relies on these components working well in practice."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and standard machine learning resources. Activation extraction, mini-batch K-means, and linear probe training are computationally manageable for typical large models (e.g., ResNet50, T5). The data requirements (large unlabeled set, smaller curated concept set) are realistic, although curating the concept set requires effort. Building the visualization toolkit is an engineering task but standard. The main risks are empirical: the quality of clusters found by K-means, the stability and meaningfulness of the concept mapping, and the actual impact of the proposed intervention mechanism. Overall, the plan is realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized challenge of black-box model interpretability and behavior attribution, which is crucial for AI safety, fairness, debugging, and trustworthiness. By aiming to bridge mechanistic and concept-based interpretability at scale, reducing reliance on extensive labeling, and providing actionable intervention mechanisms, the research has the potential for major advancements. If successful, the framework and open-source toolkit could be widely adopted by researchers and practitioners, leading to a deeper understanding and better control of complex AI systems."
