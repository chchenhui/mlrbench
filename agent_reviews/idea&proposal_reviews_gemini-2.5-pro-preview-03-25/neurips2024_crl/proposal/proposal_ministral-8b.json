    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task (causal representation learning in latent spaces for generative models), elaborates on the specific research idea (Causal Diffusion Models), and positions itself relevantly to the provided literature (citing recent work and acknowledging key challenges like latent variables, confounders, and interpretability). The objectives and methodology directly stem from the idea and aim to tackle problems highlighted in the task and literature."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology (broken into three steps), experimental plan, and expected outcomes are presented logically. However, the mathematical formulations are high-level and lack specific detail on how the causal graph G concretely modifies the denoising function D_theta, or the precise form of the causal discovery loss L_causal. While the overall concept is understandable, these crucial implementation details remain somewhat ambiguous, slightly hindering perfect clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing the integration of explicit causal structure learning within the latent space and iterative process of diffusion models. While causal generative models exist (as shown in the literature review, often using VAEs or Flows), applying this concept specifically to diffusion models, particularly by modifying the denoising steps based on a learned causal graph, represents a fresh and innovative approach. It combines state-of-the-art generative models with causal principles in a non-trivial way."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, based on established principles of diffusion models and causal representation learning. The high-level methodology (causal discovery, integration, joint optimization) is logical. However, the soundness is limited by the lack of technical detail. Key challenges, such as the identifiability of causal structures in latent spaces from observational data and the specific mechanism for incorporating the graph into the diffusion process, are not fully addressed. The mathematical formulations are abstract, and potential issues like handling hidden confounders (a key challenge from the literature) are mentioned as goals but not explicitly tackled in the methodology section. More rigorous justification and detail on the proposed mechanisms are needed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Diffusion models are computationally intensive, and adding a causal discovery component, especially one that needs to be jointly optimized, will increase complexity and resource requirements. Causal discovery in latent spaces is inherently difficult and may require specific types of data (interventional) or strong assumptions/constraints. Evaluating the causal disentanglement and counterfactual generation effectively, especially on real-world complex data like biomedical images or text, will also be challenging. While conceptually plausible, successful implementation requires overcoming substantial technical hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical limitation of current state-of-the-art generative models â€“ their inability to distinguish correlation from causation, leading to issues with trustworthiness, bias, and controllability. Successfully developing CDMs could lead to major advancements in creating more reliable, interpretable, and controllable generative AI, particularly impactful in sensitive domains like healthcare (biomedical imaging). It directly tackles core problems in the field of Causal Representation Learning and generative modeling."
