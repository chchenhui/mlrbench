    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on Causal Representation Learning (CRL), causal generative models, latent causal variables, and bridging deep generative models (specifically diffusion models) with causality. It thoroughly expands on the core research idea of Causal Diffusion Models (CDMs), detailing the integration of causal graphs, discovery, and conditioning. Furthermore, it acknowledges the cited literature, positioning itself appropriately by highlighting the novelty of applying these concepts specifically to the latent dynamics of diffusion models, compared to prior work often focusing on VAEs or Bayesian methods. It explicitly aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review and task description, such as latent variable identification, interpretability, and robustness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, motivation, research objectives, and significance are presented logically and persuasively. The methodology section outlines the conceptual framework, data requirements, algorithmic steps (including specific ideas for latent extraction, causal discovery, and conditioning), and a detailed evaluation plan. The structure is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, typical for a proposal, such as the precise mechanism for ensuring latent variable stability across time steps or the exact formulation of the causal conditioning loss (L_{control}), but these do not significantly hinder understanding of the core proposal. Overall, the research plan is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While causal generative models and diffusion models exist independently, the core idea of deeply integrating a learned causal graph structure into the latent space and conditioning the *denoising steps* of a diffusion model based on this graph appears novel. It distinguishes itself from standard conditional diffusion (which typically conditions on external labels) and existing causal generative models cited (like C2VAE using VAEs, or DeCaFlow/CausalBGM focusing on confounding in different frameworks). The proposal clearly articulates this novelty by aiming to structure the latent dynamics causally. While building on existing concepts, the specific combination and application to diffusion models represent a fresh and potentially impactful research direction."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on established foundations of diffusion models (DDPMs) and causal discovery methods (e.g., NOTEARS). The proposed methodological components (latent extraction from U-Net, score-based causal discovery, GNN/attention-based conditioning) are plausible integration strategies. The evaluation plan is comprehensive. However, there are non-trivial technical challenges that temper the soundness score slightly: 1) Defining and extracting stable, causally meaningful latent variables (z) from the intermediate states (x_t) or layers of the diffusion U-Net is complex and not fully resolved. 2) Applying causal discovery algorithms effectively in this high-dimensional, dynamically changing latent space poses significant theoretical and practical hurdles (e.g., identifiability, optimization stability). 3) Jointly optimizing the diffusion, causal discovery, and control objectives can be challenging. While the overall direction is sound, the proposal relies on assumptions about the feasibility of these integrations that require empirical validation and potentially further theoretical grounding."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges and risks. Training diffusion models is computationally intensive. Integrating causal discovery modules and modifying the U-Net architecture for causal conditioning requires significant engineering effort and expertise in both domains. The joint optimization process is likely difficult to stabilize and tune. Obtaining suitable real-world datasets with ground truth or even reliable proxy causal information is challenging, although the plan to use synthetic and benchmark data is appropriate for initial validation. The core technical risks lie in successfully learning a meaningful causal graph in the diffusion latent space and effectively conditioning the generation process on it. While achievable by a well-resourced team, the path to success involves overcoming substantial technical hurdles, making the overall feasibility satisfactory but not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations of state-of-the-art generative models â€“ their reliance on correlations, lack of fine-grained control, and interpretability issues. Successfully developing CDMs would represent a major advancement, potentially leading to more trustworthy AI for high-stakes applications (healthcare, finance), enhanced creative tools through causal control, new avenues for scientific discovery via counterfactual generation, and fundamental progress in bridging deep learning with causal reasoning. The research directly aligns with the goals of CRL and the potential development of Causal Foundation Models, tackling key challenges identified in the field. The potential impact is substantial and clearly articulated."
