    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for integrating causality into deep generative models like diffusion models, as highlighted in the task description. The research objectives precisely match the core concepts outlined in the research idea (joint optimization, causal discovery in latent space, integration into diffusion, controlled generation). The methodology builds upon and aims to tackle the challenges identified in the provided literature review (latent variable identification, confounder handling - though implicitly, embedding structure, scalability). All sections consistently reinforce the central theme of Causal Diffusion Models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, background, and significance are well-defined. The methodology section outlines the core components (Encoder/Decoder, Causal Discovery, Causal Diffusion) and provides specific mathematical formulations (Eq 1-5) and an optimization strategy. The experimental plan, including datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablations, is clearly laid out. Minor ambiguities exist: the exact mechanism for conditioning the noise predictor \\\\epsilon_\\\\theta on the graph G could be slightly more explicit, and the theoretical justification for the specific form of the causal correction term in Eq (3) could be stronger. However, the overall proposal is readily understandable and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing a specific mechanism to integrate latent causal discovery (via NOTEARS on latent codes) directly into the denoising process of diffusion models. While causal generative models and diffusion models exist independently, and combining them is a known research direction (as per the survey), the proposed method of modifying the reverse diffusion step (Eq 3) based on the concurrently learned SEM (Eq 1, 2) appears to be a novel technical contribution compared to existing works like C2VAE (VAE-based) or DeCaFlow (Flow-based, uses known graph/proxies). It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it combines known components (Diffusion, NOTEARS), but the specific integration strategy is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has potential weaknesses. It relies on established methods like DDPMs and NOTEARS. However, the core methodological choices have limitations: 1) The linear SEM assumption for latent variables (Eq 1) is restrictive for complex real-world data, although acknowledged as a point for future work. 2) The modification to the diffusion reverse process (Eq 3) with the term \\\\kappa\\\\,A^\\\\top z_t is presented heuristically; its theoretical grounding (e.g., ensuring it corresponds to a valid conditional probability or maintains desirable properties of the diffusion process) is not established in the proposal. 3) While NOTEARS addresses acyclicity, its ability to handle latent confounders *within* the latent space z is not explicitly discussed, which is a key challenge mentioned in the literature review. The joint optimization procedure is complex and its convergence properties are not analyzed. Technical formulations appear correct, but the justification for the core causal injection mechanism needs strengthening."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML technology and expertise. Implementing diffusion models, autoencoders, and NOTEARS optimization is achievable using standard frameworks like PyTorch. The proposed datasets are mostly standard benchmarks or accessible real-world data. The evaluation plan uses appropriate metrics and baselines. However, challenges exist: the joint optimization of the encoder, decoder, diffusion model, and causal graph parameters can be complex and computationally expensive, potentially facing convergence issues. The effectiveness of the heuristic causal injection term needs empirical validation. Scaling might be demanding. Overall, it's ambitious but realistic for a well-resourced research project, with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current state-of-the-art generative models (lack of causal reasoning) and aims to bridge the gap between diffusion models and causal representation learning. Success would provide a powerful tool for generating data with controllable causal factors, enhancing interpretability, fairness, and robustness. The potential applications, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare (e.g., controlled generation of medical images for specific disease factors) and science, are substantial. It directly tackles key challenges highlighted in the CRL workshop task description and has the potential to make major advancements in trustworthy AI."
