        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (Causal Representation Learning Workshop). It directly addresses core themes like 'Causal representation learning', specifically mentioning 'multi-modal or multi-environment CRL'. It aims to learn robust representations that go beyond correlations, tackle domain generalization (via multi-environment data), and achieve interpretability (via causal graphs), all central goals outlined in the workshop description. Furthermore, it proposes applications in 'healthcare' and '(medical) imaging', which are explicitly listed as relevant real-world application domains."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (failure under distribution shifts, need for causal disentanglement in multi-modal data) is clearly stated. The main idea outlines a specific framework combining contrastive learning, modality-specific encoders, and differentiable causal discovery to infer shared latent causal variables. The objectives (improved OOD accuracy, interpretable graphs) and target benchmarks are explicitly mentioned. There is minimal ambiguity, making the proposal immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While causal representation learning, multi-modal learning, and multi-environment learning exist as separate areas, the proposed integration specifically focused on discovering *shared* causal structures *across modalities* by aligning them *across environments* using differentiable causal discovery is innovative. It moves beyond standard multi-modal fusion or single-modality CRL by explicitly modeling cross-modal causal dependencies for robustness. The combination of contrastive learning for invariance and differentiable causal discovery for structure alignment in this specific cross-modal, multi-environment setting offers a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The components like modality-specific encoders, contrastive learning, and sparsity constraints are standard. Multi-modal datasets for domains like healthcare exist. However, differentiable causal discovery methods can be computationally intensive, sensitive to hyperparameters, and may struggle with identifiability guarantees, especially in complex latent variable models involving multiple modalities and environments. Integrating these components effectively and ensuring the learned graphs represent meaningful causal relationships requires careful engineering and validation. The reliance on interventional data is correctly noted as optional ('if available'), making the core idea feasible with observational multi-environment data, which is common in CRL."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing robustness to distribution shifts is a critical challenge in modern ML. Applying this to multi-modal data, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare (e.g., combining imaging and clinical notes for diagnosis across different hospitals/settings), has immense potential impact. Successfully learning robust and interpretable causal representations from such data could lead to more reliable, trustworthy, and generalizable AI systems, representing a major advancement for both the CRL field and its practical applications."
