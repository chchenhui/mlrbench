        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core goal of bridging the gap between deep learning theory and practice, specifically focusing on the 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice' topic. It tackles key questions raised in the task description, such as convergence beyond the stable regime, understanding the Edge of Stability (EoS), and using continuous approximations (SDEs) for gradient dynamics, all within the context of large models where theoretical guidance is most needed."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (gap in understanding EoS), the proposed approach (modified gradient flows/SDEs incorporating noise and Hessian properties), the validation plan (experiments on ViTs/LLMs), and the expected outcomes (convergence guarantees, practical guidelines) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The core concepts are immediately understandable, providing a strong foundation for the research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While EoS and the use of SDEs in optimization are existing research areas, the proposal to specifically integrate stochastic gradient noise and Hessian spectral properties within a modified gradient flow/SDE framework to derive convergence conditions *for the EoS regime* offers a fresh perspective. Applying and validating this framework on modern large architectures like ViTs and LLMs adds practical novelty. It builds upon prior work but proposes a distinct theoretical angle and validation strategy."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible, though challenging. The theoretical analysis involving SDEs, stochastic noise, and Hessian spectral properties requires significant mathematical expertise but is conceptually sound. Deriving rigorous convergence guarantees might prove difficult. The experimental validation on large models (ViTs, LLMs) necessitates substantial computational resources and careful implementation (e.g., estimating Hessian properties during training). While demanding, it is achievable within a well-equipped research environment focused on large-scale ML theory and empirics."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the EoS phenomenon is critical for optimizing large, costly models where empirical tuning often pushes optimizers into this regime. Providing a theoretical framework, potential convergence guarantees, and practical guidelines for navigating or even exploiting EoS could lead to major advancements in training efficiency, stability, and principled optimizer design for state-of-the-art models. It addresses a key bottleneck in the 'large model era'."
