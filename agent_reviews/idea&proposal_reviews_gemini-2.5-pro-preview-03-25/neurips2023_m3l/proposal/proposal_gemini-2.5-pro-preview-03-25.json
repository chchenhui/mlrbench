        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task description: bridging the gap between optimization theory and deep learning practice, especially for large models. It focuses specifically on the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon, continuous approximations (SDEs), and adaptive algorithms, all highlighted as key topics. The proposal faithfully translates the research idea into a detailed plan, incorporating the suggested theoretical tools (SDEs, curvature analysis) and the goal of designing an adaptive EoS optimizer aiming for significant speedups. Furthermore, it explicitly references the key papers from the literature review (Cohen et al., Arora et al., etc.) and frames its objectives and methodology around addressing the challenges identified therein (understanding EoS, adaptive algorithm design, curvature estimation, stability/acceleration balance, theory-practice gap). There are no discernible inconsistencies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, motivation, problem statement, and objectives are articulated concisely and logically. The methodology section provides a detailed step-by-step plan for each phase (theoretical characterization, algorithm design, theoretical analysis, empirical validation), including specific techniques (discrete dynamics, SDEs, power iteration for Hessian eigenvalues, HVP) and even a concrete proposal for the learning rate adaptation rule in AdaEoS. The experimental setup (benchmarks, baselines, metrics) is clearly specified. The language is precise, and the structure is easy to follow. While some aspects, like the exact modifications needed for SDEs or the precise assumptions for theoretical proofs, are inherently part of the research to be conducted, the plan to tackle them is clearly laid out."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the EoS phenomenon itself has been identified (Cohen et al.) and analyzed (Arora et al.), and adaptive methods exist (e.g., Adam), the core idea of designing an optimizer (AdaEoS) that *explicitly estimates curvature* (\\lambda_{\\max}) and *dynamically adjusts the learning rate to actively target and maintain the EoS boundary* (\\eta \\lambda_{\\max} \\approx 2) is a novel algorithmic contribution. This differs significantly from existing adaptive methods that typically adapt based on gradient moments. Furthermore, the proposed theoretical investigation aims to deepen the understanding of EoS dynamics using a combination of discrete analysis and potentially modified continuous approximations (SDEs) specifically tailored to capture the oscillatory behavior near instability, which goes beyond existing SDE analyses for standard SGD regimes. The novelty is clearly articulated against the backdrop of the provided literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (optimization theory, stability analysis, dynamical systems, SDEs) and relevant prior work identified in the literature review. The proposed methodology is robust: combining theoretical analysis (discrete dynamics, SDEs) with practical algorithm design (AdaEoS using established techniques like HVP and power iteration for curvature estimation) and rigorous empirical validation (standard large-scale benchmarks, strong baselines, comprehensive metrics). The technical formulations presented (stability condition, HVP formula, adaptation rule) are correct. The proposal realistically acknowledges the challenges, particularly in the theoretical analysis of the adaptive algorithm and the potential noise in curvature estimation, indicating a well-considered approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Implementing the AdaEoS optimizer, including Hessian-vector products and power iteration, is achievable within standard deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. The planned experiments on ImageNet and language models are standard, albeit computationally intensive, requiring access to significant GPU resources. The main feasibility challenge lies in the trade-off between the computational overhead of estimating \\lambda_{\\max} (requiring extra gradient computations) and the potential gains in convergence speed (wall-clock time). The proposal acknowledges this and suggests mitigation strategies (few power iterations, mini-batch approximations), but empirical validation is crucial. Additionally, the theoretical analysis of the adaptive, non-convex system might prove difficult and may require simplifying assumptions. Overall, the plan is realistic, but success hinges on managing the computational overhead effectively and navigating the theoretical complexities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in machine learning: the efficient and principled optimization of large-scale deep learning models, directly tackling the theory-practice gap highlighted in the task description. Understanding and harnessing the Edge of Stability phenomenon could lead to major advancements in optimization theory for deep learning. The proposed AdaEoS algorithm, if successful in delivering the targeted 2-3x speedups, would have substantial practical impact by drastically reducing the computational cost and time for training foundation models. This would benefit the entire field, potentially democratizing access to large models and contributing to more sustainable AI development ('Green AI'). The potential contributions to both theory and practice are substantial and clearly articulated."
