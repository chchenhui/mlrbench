    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of bridging deep learning theory and practice, specifically focusing on the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon, continuous approximations of optimization dynamics, and the development of advanced adaptive algorithms – all key topics mentioned in the task description. The methodology follows the research idea closely, proposing SDEs to model EoS and designing an adaptive algorithm (EAGD) based on these insights. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the provided literature review, such as understanding EoS dynamics, designing adaptive algorithms, and efficient curvature estimation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It presents a logical structure, starting with a strong motivation and clear objectives. The methodology section meticulously outlines the theoretical approach (SDEs for parameters and eigenvalues), the proposed algorithm (EAGD) with its update rules and adaptation mechanisms, implementation considerations, and a comprehensive experimental plan. The evaluation metrics, datasets, models, and ablation studies are explicitly stated. While some specific mathematical forms (e.g., functions in the SDEs) are naturally left for the research phase, the overall plan, rationale, and expected outcomes are articulated with high precision and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing work on EoS (Cohen et al., Arora et al.) and continuous-time approximations, it introduces novel elements. The proposed theoretical framework involving coupled SDEs to model both parameter *and* Hessian eigenvalue dynamics simultaneously appears innovative. The EAGD algorithm, designed to explicitly maintain operation near the EoS boundary (2/\\\\eta) by dynamically adapting the learning rate and incorporating a curvature correction term based on real-time estimates of the top Hessian eigenvalue/eigenvector, represents a novel algorithmic contribution distinct from existing adaptive methods like Adam or Sophia. The integration of this specific theoretical modeling with the targeted algorithm design constitutes a fresh approach."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, grounded in established concepts like SDEs, Hessian analysis, and adaptive optimization. The use of Hessian-vector products and Lanczos for spectral estimation is appropriate. However, the specific formulation of the coupled SDEs (Eqs. 1 & 2) requires rigorous derivation and justification, which is not yet provided. Similarly, the convergence properties of the proposed EAGD algorithm, especially operating near the stability boundary in non-convex settings, need theoretical analysis. The adaptive learning rate rule (Eq. 5) is heuristic, and the adaptation mechanism for the curvature coefficient \\\\beta_t needs further elaboration. While the overall approach is plausible, key theoretical underpinnings require significant development and validation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Developing the theoretical framework (SDE analysis, convergence proofs) is demanding. Implementing efficient, robust, and low-overhead real-time estimation of the top Hessian eigenvalue and eigenvector for large-scale models, potentially in distributed settings, is a major practical hurdle acknowledged by the proposal. Tuning the EAGD hyperparameters might also require considerable effort. The planned scaling experiments necessitate access to substantial computational resources, which the proposal notes requires partnerships. While ambitious, the outlined steps and consideration of efficiency suggest feasibility with the right expertise and resources, though risks related to theoretical tractability and practical performance remain."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and widely recognized problem in deep learning: the gap between optimization theory and practice, particularly the EoS phenomenon. Successfully understanding and leveraging EoS could lead to major advancements in training efficiency for large-scale models, which is a critical need in the field. The potential outcomes – a deeper theoretical understanding, a novel and faster optimization algorithm (EAGD), and practical benefits like reduced computational/environmental costs and democratization of AI – represent substantial contributions with broad impact across AI research and industry."
