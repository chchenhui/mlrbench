        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem of understanding and leveraging the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon in large-scale deep learning, a key topic highlighted in the task description ('Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice', 'Convergence analysis beyond the stable regime', 'Continuous approximations', 'Advanced optimization algorithms'). The objectives (SDE characterization, adaptive algorithm) match the research idea precisely. The methodology incorporates concepts (SDEs, curvature estimation) and addresses challenges identified in the literature review ([1-4]). The proposal explicitly connects its significance to the task's goals (reducing computational waste, bridging theory-practice, scalability) and workshop topics ('Scaling Laws', 'Emergent Phenomena')."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to methodology and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology, including the SDE formulation, the CAEO algorithm pseudocode, curvature estimation techniques, and the experimental plan (datasets, models, baselines, metrics, ablations), is articulated concisely and with minimal ambiguity. The use of mathematical notation is appropriate and clear. While the exact theoretical derivations for the SDE analysis are naturally left for the research itself, the proposed approach is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing work on EoS ([1], [2]), SDE approximations of SGD ([3], [4]), and curvature-aware optimization, it proposes a novel synthesis. Specifically, the theoretical goal of using an SDE/Fokker-Planck framework to derive *stability thresholds* for EoS dynamics appears novel. The proposed CAEO algorithm, which dynamically adapts the learning rate based on estimated curvature to explicitly maintain operation near the EoS boundary ( \\\\eta \\\\lambda_{\\\\text{max}} \\\\approx 2 ) with a stability margin ( \\\\delta ), represents a fresh algorithmic approach distinct from standard adaptive methods (like AdamW) or generic second-order methods. The combination of these theoretical and algorithmic components targeted specifically at EoS is innovative."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established theoretical concepts (SDEs, Fokker-Planck equations, Hessian analysis, EoS observations) and utilizes well-accepted methodologies (Power method, KFAC/Hutchinson for curvature estimation). The proposed CAEO algorithm is mathematically well-defined. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Minor gaps exist primarily in the inherent difficulty of proving the validity of the SDE approximation in the complex EoS regime and guaranteeing convergence for the proposed non-convex optimizer, but these are acknowledged as research challenges to be addressed, not flaws in the proposal's foundation. Technical formulations presented are correct."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The algorithmic component (CAEO) is implementable using standard deep learning frameworks and libraries for Hessian-vector products or approximations (KFAC, Hutchinson). The proposed efficient curvature estimation methods (\\\\\\\\mathcal{O}(d)) make it potentially applicable to large models. The experimental plan uses standard datasets and models, although requiring significant computational resources (GPU/TPU clusters), which is typical for this research area. The main challenges lie in the theoretical analysis (which is ambitious but doesn't block empirical progress) and ensuring that the computational overhead of curvature estimation doesn't negate the convergence speedups in terms of wall-clock time. The plan to measure both FLOPs and wall-clock time addresses this. Overall, the plan is realistic with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the lack of theoretical understanding and principled methods for training large-scale models efficiently, particularly concerning the EoS phenomenon. Success would yield substantial contributions: 1) Theoretical advancements in understanding non-convex optimization dynamics near stability boundaries. 2) A practical, potentially much faster optimization algorithm (CAEO) that could drastically reduce the enormous computational cost (time, energy, carbon footprint) associated with training foundation models. 3) Bridging the gap between optimization theory and deep learning practice, as called for by the task description. The potential 1.5-3.5x speedup and open-source release would have broad impact across research and industry."
