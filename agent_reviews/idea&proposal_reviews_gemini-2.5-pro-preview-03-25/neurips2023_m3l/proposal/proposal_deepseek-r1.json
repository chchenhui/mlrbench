    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the task ('Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice'), focusing specifically on the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon, continuous approximations (SDEs), and adaptive algorithms â€“ all explicitly mentioned as key topics. The proposal faithfully elaborates on the research idea, detailing the SDE modeling, the EoS-Ada algorithm concept, and the goal of accelerating large model training. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature (Cohen et al., Arora et al., Wang & Sirignano, Lugosi & Nualart) and directly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as understanding EoS dynamics, designing adaptive optimizers, efficient curvature estimation, and bridging theory with practice."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives (Theoretical Analysis, Algorithm Design, Empirical Validation), and significance are articulated concisely and without ambiguity. The methodology section is well-structured, presenting the SDE model, curvature estimation technique, and the proposed EoS-Ada algorithm with clear mathematical formulations. The experimental design is detailed and logical. The overall structure flows logically from introduction to expected outcomes. A minor point for potential refinement could be a slightly more detailed theoretical justification for the specific form of the noise modulation function, but overall, the proposal is immediately understandable and leaves little room for misinterpretation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts in a novel way to address the EoS challenge. While EoS, SDE approximations for SGD, adaptive optimization, and randomized curvature estimation are known concepts (as evidenced by the literature review), the proposal's novelty lies in: 1) Specifically modeling EoS dynamics via SDEs that explicitly couple curvature and gradient noise interaction. 2) Designing an adaptive optimizer (EoS-Ada) that *actively targets* the EoS regime (\\eta \\lambda_{\\text{max}} \\approx \\alpha \\approx 2) using efficient curvature feedback. 3) Introducing adaptive *gradient noise modulation* based on curvature as a mechanism to stabilize EoS dynamics, going beyond typical learning rate adaptation. 4) Applying this integrated framework specifically to accelerate large-scale model training. It offers a fresh perspective and a new combination of techniques distinct from prior work like StableAdam, focusing on dynamic control within the EoS regime."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (SDEs, optimization theory, Hessian analysis) and cites relevant, recent literature. The proposed methodology is well-justified: the SDE approach is standard for analyzing discrete dynamics, the randomized Neumann series is a valid technique for approximating dominant eigenvalues, and the adaptive learning rate rule is directly motivated by the EoS condition. The inclusion of theoretical analysis (Phase-Plane, Lyapunov) and the plan for convergence guarantees indicate a commitment to rigor. The experimental design is robust, including multiple baselines, diverse tasks, relevant metrics, and statistical validation. Potential minor weaknesses include the inherent challenges in proving convergence for adaptive methods in non-convex settings under SDE approximations and the need for empirical validation of the specific noise modulation strategy."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. The core algorithmic idea (EoS-Ada) seems implementable within standard deep learning frameworks. The use of randomized methods for curvature estimation is crucial for feasibility with large models, avoiding full Hessian computation. However, challenges remain: 1) The computational overhead of curvature estimation, even if reduced to O(kd), needs to be carefully benchmarked against baselines like Adam to ensure a net wall-clock time improvement. 2) Tuning the new hyperparameters (\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) might require significant effort. 3) Achieving the ambitious 2-3x speedup consistently across different large-scale architectures and datasets requires robust empirical validation. 4) The theoretical analysis (convergence guarantees) might prove difficult to obtain rigorously. Overall, the plan is realistic, but successful execution depends on overcoming these practical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in modern machine learning: the gap between optimization theory and the practice of training large-scale models, specifically focusing on the poorly understood EoS phenomenon. Developing a principled understanding and method to exploit EoS for faster training could lead to substantial reductions in computational cost (time, energy, money), directly impacting the feasibility and accessibility of foundation models. The potential 2-3x speedup claim, if realized, would be a major advancement. Beyond the practical algorithm, the theoretical insights into EoS dynamics, gradient noise, and curvature interaction would be a valuable contribution to non-convex optimization theory and our understanding of deep learning."
