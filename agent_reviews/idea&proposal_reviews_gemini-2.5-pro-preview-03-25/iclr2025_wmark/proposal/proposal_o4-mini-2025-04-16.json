    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (GenAI watermarking workshop themes like robustness, evaluation, industry needs), the research idea (Dynamic Adversarial Training for robustness), and the literature review (citing relevant works like InvisMark, Certifiable Smoothing, VINE, W-Bench, and addressing key challenges like adversarial robustness and generalization). It directly tackles the core problem outlined in the motivation and leverages concepts from the cited literature to build its methodology and evaluation plan. All sections consistently contribute to the central theme of achieving robust watermarking through dynamic adversarial training."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The objectives (O1-O4), methodology overview, architectures, datasets, and evaluation plan are clearly articulated. However, there is a notable ambiguity and potential inconsistency in the formulation of the final minimax objective function in Section 2.4. The definition of L_adv and its role within the combined objective `min_{theta,phi} max_{i} [L_detect + lambda*L_perc] - mu*sum_{i} L_adv` is confusing, especially comparing it to the definition of L_adv in 2.4 and the objective stated in O3 (`min_G max_A L_detect + lambda*L_perc - mu*L_adv(A,G)`). This specific mathematical formulation requires clarification or correction for perfect clarity, slightly hindering the immediate understanding of the precise optimization process."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial training is a known technique, its specific application as a *dynamic* co-training process between a watermark embedder and an *ensemble* of *learned* watermark removal adversaries (in addition to classical distortions) appears novel within the generative AI watermarking domain. It moves beyond static robustness evaluations or defenses against fixed attack types, proposing an adaptive defense mechanism. This distinguishes it from cited works focusing on specific embedding methods or certified robustness against predefined threat models. The novelty lies in the dynamic, game-theoretic training framework tailored for watermark robustness against evolving threats."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, based on established principles of adversarial training and standard deep learning architectures (U-Net, ResNet). The use of relevant loss functions (BCE, MSE, CLIP) and a comprehensive evaluation plan including standard metrics and strong baselines is appropriate. However, the soundness is slightly weakened by the lack of clarity and potential error in the mathematical formulation of the minimax objective in Section 2.4, as mentioned under Clarity. A correct and well-justified objective function is crucial for the rigor of the proposed training. Assuming the intended minimax game is sound, the overall approach is rigorous, but this specific formulation needs refinement."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Using large datasets (FFHQ, ImageNet) and complex models (U-Net, ResNet) for high-resolution images (1024x1024) combined with adversarial training (especially with multiple dynamic adversaries) requires substantial computational resources (GPU time, memory) and careful tuning. Adversarial training is known for potential instability. Achieving the ambitious target metrics (PSNR>=50, Acc>=95% under strong attacks) simultaneously might be difficult. The 12-month timeline is plausible for an expert team with adequate resources but could be tight given the potential for debugging and tuning the complex training dynamics."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Robustness against adversarial removal is a critical bottleneck for the practical deployment and trustworthiness of AI watermarking. By aiming to create watermarks resilient to adaptive and unseen attacks, the research directly addresses a major challenge highlighted in the literature and relevant to industry needs (content provenance, IP protection) and policy discussions. Success would represent a substantial advancement over static watermarking methods, potentially leading to more reliable systems for tracing AI-generated content and impacting standards for watermark robustness. The plan to release code and benchmarks further enhances its potential impact."
