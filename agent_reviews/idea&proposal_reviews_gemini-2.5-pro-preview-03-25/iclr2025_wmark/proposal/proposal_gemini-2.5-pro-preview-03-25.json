        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key topics, including algorithmic advances (DAT), adversarial robustness, evaluation/benchmarks, and industry requirements (via enhanced security). The proposal accurately reflects the core research idea of using dynamic adversarial training for robust watermarking. It effectively integrates insights from the literature review, citing relevant papers (e.g., InvisMark, Jiang et al., Thakkar et al.), acknowledging their contributions, identifying the gap in robustness against adaptive attacks, and positioning the proposed work accordingly. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all logically derived from and consistent with the initial idea and the identified challenges in the literature."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, problem statement, and research objectives are articulated precisely. The methodology section provides a detailed and understandable description of the DAT framework, including its components (Embedder, Detector, Adversary Suite), data requirements, algorithmic steps with mathematical formulations (loss functions, min-max optimization), and a comprehensive experimental design. The evaluation metrics, baselines, and ablation studies are clearly specified. The expected outcomes and potential impact are logically presented and easy to grasp. The overall structure is logical and facilitates understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While adversarial training itself is an established technique, its specific application as a *Dynamic Adversarial Training (DAT)* framework, involving the co-training of an embedder/detector with a *suite* of adaptive adversaries (both fixed and learned) specifically for enhancing the robustness and *generalization* of GenAI *image* watermarks, represents a novel approach in this domain. It distinguishes itself from static robustness methods (like InvisMark) and certified robustness approaches (like Jiang et al.). It also aims to go beyond the work of Thakkar et al. by focusing specifically on GenAI content provenance and generalization against unseen attacks within a dedicated framework. The emphasis on dynamic adaptation against a diverse set of evolving threats is a key innovative aspect."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon the solid theoretical foundation of adversarial machine learning and min-max optimization. The proposed methodology (DAT framework, network architectures like U-Nets/CNNs, loss functions combining perceptual quality and robustness) is well-established and appropriate for the task. The mathematical formulations for the loss functions and the overall optimization objective are correctly presented and clearly explained. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant SOTA baselines, standard datasets, comprehensive evaluation metrics covering imperceptibility, robustness (against seen and unseen attacks), capacity, and computational cost, along with well-chosen ablation studies. The approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard datasets (ImageNet, COCO), readily available pre-trained generative models (Stable Diffusion, StyleGANs), and common deep learning frameworks and architectures. The proposed DAT methodology, while computationally intensive (requiring iterative training of multiple networks), is implementable with standard GPU resources available in research labs. The scope is well-defined (initially focusing on images). Potential challenges like stabilizing the adversarial training process are acknowledged research risks rather than fundamental feasibility blockers. The plan for evaluation is comprehensive but achievable within a typical research project timeline."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the vulnerability of watermarks in AI-generated content to adversarial attacks. Ensuring robust provenance is crucial for combating misinformation, protecting intellectual property, and fostering trust in GenAI technologies, aligning directly with industry needs and policy concerns mentioned in the task description. Successfully developing a DAT framework that enhances robustness, particularly against adaptive and unseen attacks, would represent a major advancement in the field. The potential contributions – a novel robust watermarking technique, insights into robustness trade-offs, and potentially influencing evaluation standards – are substantial."
