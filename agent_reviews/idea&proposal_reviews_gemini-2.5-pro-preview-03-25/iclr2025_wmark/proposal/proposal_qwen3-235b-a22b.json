        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on adversarial robustness and evaluation benchmarks for GenAI watermarking. The methodology clearly implements the core research idea of dynamic adversarial training. It effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, positioning the work within the current research landscape and explicitly tackling the identified key challenges like robustness against diverse attacks and the imperceptibility-robustness trade-off. All sections consistently reinforce the central theme and objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, motivation, and objectives are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a clear overview of the co-training framework, including the roles of the generator, attackers, and detector, along with a precise mathematical formulation. Specific details for image and text modalities, evaluation metrics, and the experimental plan are laid out logically and are easy to understand. There are no significant ambiguities."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While adversarial training is a known technique and has been linked to watermarking (Ref [8]), the specific application of a *dynamic* co-evolutionary adversarial framework involving an embedder and a *suite* of attackers for robust *multi-modal* (image and text) generative AI watermarking is innovative. It distinguishes itself from static methods or those focusing solely on certified robustness against predefined attacks by aiming for adaptability and generalization to *unseen* attacks through the co-training loop. The unified framework for both image and text is also a novel aspect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of adversarial machine learning (mini-max optimization, GANs) and watermarking. The proposed methodology, including the co-training framework, specific architectural choices (U-Net), domain-specific losses/metrics (SSIM, CLIP, BLEU), and the use of WGAN-GP for stability, is technically well-founded. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, incorporating standard benchmarks and relevant baselines. Minor areas for further justification include the precise mechanism for dynamically evolving the attacker suite and the potential challenge of achieving the highly ambitious performance targets simultaneously, but the overall approach is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The required techniques (deep learning, adversarial training) and tools (PyTorch, attack libraries) are available. However, training complex adversarial systems, especially across two modalities, is computationally intensive and requires careful tuning for stability and convergence. Successfully designing an attacker suite that promotes generalization to truly unseen attacks is non-trivial. Achieving the high performance claimed for both robustness and imperceptibility simultaneously might require significant effort and potentially compromises. The scope is ambitious, requiring substantial resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Robust watermarking for generative AI is a critical need for content authentication, provenance tracking, and mitigating misuse, directly relevant to industry needs and policy discussions (e.g., EU AI Act). Developing a method resilient to diverse and evolving adversarial attacks would be a major advancement. Success would have substantial impact on the field, potentially setting new standards for robust watermarking and influencing practical deployments in media and AI platforms. The focus on standardized evaluation also contributes to the field's progress."
