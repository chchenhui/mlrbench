        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core task of improving GenAI watermarking robustness against adversarial attacks, which is a key topic mentioned in the task description. The methodology (dynamic adversarial training) perfectly matches the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges (robustness vs. imperceptibility trade-off, evaluation) highlighted in the provided literature review and the task description's focus areas (algorithmic advances, adversarial robustness, evaluation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly written. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated logically. The core concept of co-training an embedder and attackers is explained well. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the lack of specific mathematical formulations for the loss functions (ùí´ symbols are used conceptually) and precise details on the 'suite' of attack models or the exact iterative adaptation mechanism. However, these details are often elaborated during the research process itself, and the overall proposal remains highly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality. While adversarial training and watermarking are established fields, the specific application of dynamic co-training, framed as a zero-sum game between a watermark embedder and a *suite* of watermark removal attackers to iteratively improve robustness, presents a fresh perspective. The literature review includes related work (e.g., paper [8] on adversarial training and watermarking), but this proposal's focus on a dynamic 'arms race' specifically for watermark robustness against removal attacks appears distinct. It's not groundbreaking in the sense of inventing a completely new paradigm, but it's a novel combination and refinement of existing ideas tailored effectively to the problem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound theoretical foundations, primarily leveraging the well-established concept of adversarial training from machine learning. The proposed methodology, involving co-training with specific objectives for the embedder and attacker, is logical and rigorous. The use of standard evaluation metrics (detection accuracy, SSIM, PSNR, CLIP similarity) is appropriate. While the specific mathematical details of the loss functions are not provided, the conceptual framework is robust and well-justified based on principles of adversarial learning and watermarking requirements."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML technologies, libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch), and computational resources typically available in research labs. Data collection (GAI content, attack implementations) is achievable. However, adversarial co-training is known to be potentially unstable and computationally intensive, requiring careful tuning and significant resources, especially for large models or datasets. Ensuring the framework scales efficiently (Objective 4) might pose a challenge during implementation. Balancing the embedder and the diverse suite of attackers effectively presents a moderate, non-trivial technical risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research addresses a highly significant and timely problem: ensuring the robustness of watermarks in generative AI content against adversarial removal. This is critical for content authenticity, provenance tracking, IP protection, and combating misinformation. A successful outcome would provide a valuable tool for industry and contribute significantly to the field of trustworthy AI and digital media forensics. The potential impact on standardizing evaluation and enhancing security aligns well with the goals outlined in the task description."
