        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key workshop topics like algorithmic advances, adversarial robustness, and evaluation. The methodology thoroughly expands on the core research idea of dynamic adversarial training. Furthermore, it acknowledges the limitations of existing methods cited in the literature review (like InvisMark, Unigram-Watermark) and explicitly aims to tackle the identified challenge of adversarial robustness by proposing a novel training paradigm, positioning itself effectively within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. It follows a logical structure, defining the problem, objectives, methodology, and expected impact. The core concepts of the dynamic adversarial framework, including the generator, attackers, detector, and the minimax objective, are explained well. Mathematical formulations are provided, though some specific loss terms and architectural details (e.g., specifics of multi-scale features Fi, adaptive parameter gamma) remain high-level. The training procedure and evaluation plan are clearly outlined. Overall, the proposal is understandable with only minor areas needing further specification for implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial training is a known technique, its specific application as a dynamic co-evolutionary framework where watermark embedders and a diverse suite of *evolving* attackers compete to enhance watermark robustness appears innovative in the context of generative AI watermarking. This contrasts with static methods or evaluations against fixed attack sets mentioned in the literature. The concept of a meta-attacker learning to combine strategies further adds to the novelty. It builds upon, but significantly extends, prior work like Thakkar et al. (2023) which focused more broadly on model resilience."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established concepts like adversarial training and game theory, using a standard minimax formulation. The proposed methodology, including the multi-component framework (G, D, A, Q), diverse attack strategies, multi-scale/adaptive embedding ideas, and alternating training procedure, is technically well-founded. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and uses appropriate metrics. Potential challenges like training stability and guaranteeing generalization to truly unseen attacks are inherent to adversarial setups but do not undermine the fundamental soundness of the approach. The technical formulations are generally correct, though high-level."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Implementing and stabilizing the dynamic co-evolutionary training loop involving multiple complex models (generator, detector, diverse attackers) requires significant computational resources and ML expertise. Ensuring the attackers genuinely evolve and generalize is non-trivial. While standard datasets and tools can be used, the scope (potentially multiple modalities) and the complexity of the training regime pose moderate implementation hurdles. However, the core ideas are implementable with current technology, especially if initially focused on a single modality. The risks associated with training stability and achieving strong generalization are manageable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the lack of robust watermarking techniques for AI-generated content against adversarial attacks. Successfully developing such a framework would have substantial impact, advancing the state-of-the-art from static to adaptive watermarking. It offers practical solutions for content authentication, IP protection, and misinformation mitigation, aligning with industry needs and potential regulatory requirements. The research contributes to AI safety, trust in digital media, and the scientific understanding of adversarial dynamics in information hiding."
