    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses 'Algorithmic advances' by proposing a new framework (Dynamic Adversarial Training), focuses squarely on 'Adversarial robustness and security-related topics' which is the core of the proposal, mentions 'Evaluation and benchmarks' as part of its methodology, and is motivated by 'Industry requirements' for secure content authentication. It fits perfectly within the scope and key topics of the workshop."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation clearly states the problem (vulnerability of static watermarks) and the goal (robustness). The main idea explains the core mechanism (co-training embedder and adversaries), the objective (resilience to diverse attacks), and the evaluation plan (benchmarks, metrics). Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact nature of the 'suite of adversarial attack models' and the specific dynamics of the 'zero-sum game', but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial training is a known technique, its application as a dynamic co-training framework specifically for *generating* robust watermarks, where the embedder and attackers iteratively adapt *during* training, offers a fresh perspective compared to simply testing static watermarks against known attacks or training against a fixed set of adversarial examples. It combines existing concepts (watermarking, adversarial training) in an innovative way for this specific problem domain."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current ML technology and methods. Implementing watermark embedders and attack models (ranging from simple transformations to neural networks) is standard practice. Setting up an adversarial co-training loop is achievable using existing frameworks. However, challenges typical of adversarial training, such as training stability, balancing the generator/adversaries, defining a comprehensive adversary suite, and requiring significant computational resources, make the implementation non-trivial but manageable within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Ensuring the robustness of watermarks against adversarial removal or distortion is a critical challenge for establishing trust and provenance in generative AI content. Addressing this vulnerability directly tackles a major security concern relevant to media, IP protection, and combating misinformation. A successful outcome could lead to substantially more reliable watermarking techniques, representing a meaningful contribution to the field."
