        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (MINT workshop focus on understanding, interventions, PEFT for controllability/safety), the research idea (causal circuits + targeted interventions), and the literature review (building on causal tracing, LoRA, activation steering while addressing identified challenges). It explicitly references the MINT workshop call and connects its objectives directly to the themes of interventions and understanding inner workings. The methodology leverages concepts from the cited literature (causal tracing [5], LoRA [4], activation steering [6]) and aims to tackle the key challenges outlined in the review (identifying circuits, targeted intervention, maintaining capabilities)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to objectives, detailed methodology, and expected impact. Key concepts like 'Surgical Circuit Interventions', 'LoRA-CB', and 'AO' are introduced and explained. The methodology outlines specific steps for circuit identification, intervention design (including loss functions), and evaluation. Baselines and metrics are clearly specified. Minor areas for potential refinement include a more concrete definition of 'minimal' circuit identification criteria and perhaps slightly more detail on the context-dependent AO mechanism, but overall the proposal is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing techniques like causal tracing (Meng et al. 2022, implicitly cited via [5]), LoRA [4], and activation steering/addition [1, 6], its core novelty lies in the specific *synthesis* and *application*. It proposes using causal tracing specifically to find *minimal* circuits for *harmful behaviors* and then applying interventions (LoRA-based or activation offsets) *only* to these identified components. This 'surgical' precision distinguishes it from standard LoRA/PEFT [2, 3, 4] applied more broadly, or activation steering methods [1, 6] that might target general concepts or entire layers rather than causally identified minimal circuits for specific harms. The LoRA-CB and targeted AO methods represent novel intervention strategies derived from this principle."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established techniques (causal tracing, LoRA, activation modification) from the literature. The proposed methodology is logical and includes a comprehensive evaluation plan with relevant baselines, metrics covering effectiveness, specificity, and efficiency, and planned ablation studies. The mathematical formulations for the intervention learning objectives are provided and appear reasonable. The main assumptions – that causal tracing can effectively identify relevant minimal circuits for specific harms and that highly localized interventions can be effective – are acknowledged as research questions but represent a plausible and well-motivated research direction. The plan to use open models and standard benchmarks adds to the soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Accessing open-source models (Llama, Mistral) and standard datasets is practical. Implementing LoRA-style updates and activation offsets is technically feasible. However, causal tracing at scale can be computationally intensive, requiring significant resources, especially for identifying robust circuits across multiple inputs. Reliably identifying the truly *minimal* causal circuit might be complex and require careful tuning and heuristics. Training the interventions (LoRA-CB, AO) also requires computational resources. While the plan is logical, the complexity and computational cost of the causal tracing step, particularly ensuring its robustness and scalability, introduce moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of mitigating harms (bias, toxicity) in powerful foundation models, a key focus of the MINT workshop. If successful, the proposed 'surgical' intervention approach could offer a more principled, targeted, and efficient method for enhancing AI safety compared to existing techniques, potentially allowing for safer deployment with less impact on general capabilities. Furthermore, it directly connects mechanistic interpretability (identifying circuits) with practical control, advancing both fields. The potential contribution to developing safer and more trustworthy AI systems is substantial."
