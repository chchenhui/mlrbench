        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (MINT workshop focus on interventions, controllability, understanding FMs, mitigating harms using PEFT/activation engineering), the research idea (identifying minimal causal circuits for harm, developing targeted low-rank interventions), and the literature review (building upon causal tracing, LoRA, activation steering like FLORAIN, while aiming for more targeted 'surgical' interventions). It directly addresses the workshop's themes and the core concepts outlined in the idea and literature, including the challenges identified."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology steps, experimental design, and expected outcomes are articulated logically. The motivation and significance are compelling. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise mathematical formulation and interpretation of the 'harmful circuit' C* definition and the 'rho' metric in Section 2.1, which could benefit from further refinement, but the overall approach remains understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While it builds on existing techniques like causal tracing (Doe & Smith, 2023), low-rank adaptation (LoRA - Hu et al., 2021), and activation steering (inspired by FLORAIN - Jiang et al., 2025), its core novelty lies in the synthesis and specific application: identifying *minimal causal circuits* for specific harms and applying *highly targeted* low-rank interventions (steering or weight edits) *only* to these circuits. This 'surgical' approach is distinct from broader methods like FLORAIN (applied to all heads in a layer) or standard PEFT (often for task adaptation), offering a potentially more precise and less disruptive way to mitigate harms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, grounded in established methods (causal tracing, gradient analysis, low-rank matrix factorization, standard evaluation benchmarks). The intervention mechanisms (targeted activation steering, targeted weight edits) are technically plausible extensions of existing work. The experimental design is comprehensive. However, the method for identifying the *minimal* causal circuit (Section 2.1) relies on a formula and ranking metric (rho) that appear somewhat heuristic and may require stronger theoretical justification or empirical validation to ensure they reliably identify the most effective and minimal targets for intervention. The claim of finding the 'minimal' subnetwork based on the provided formula needs more rigorous backing."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing open-source models, datasets, and libraries (HuggingFace PEFT, potentially NeuroScope). The core techniques (gradient computation, low-rank optimization, model evaluation) are standard in the field. Challenges include the computational cost and complexity of robust causal tracing across large models and diverse harms, potentially difficulties in precisely isolating minimal circuits, and the risk that interventions might have unintended side effects despite targeting. The specific performance targets mentioned (e.g., ≥90% toxicity reduction with ≤5% fluency drop) might be ambitious but serve as clear goals. Overall, the plan is realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: mitigating harms like toxicity and bias in powerful foundation models without degrading their general utility, a key challenge for safe AI deployment. By aiming for precise, efficient ('surgical') interventions, the research has the potential to offer substantial improvements over costly full fine-tuning or less targeted methods. Success would advance model controllability, provide deeper mechanistic insights into how harms are encoded, democratize safety techniques through lower computational costs, and potentially inform future AI policy and auditing practices. The alignment with the MINT workshop's goals further underscores its significance."
