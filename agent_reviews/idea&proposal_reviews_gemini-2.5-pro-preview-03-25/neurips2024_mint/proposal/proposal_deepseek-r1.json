        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the MINT workshop's focus on interventions (mechanistic, activation-based), understanding FM internals (causal tracing), PEFT for control, and mitigating harmful content. The proposal faithfully operationalizes the research idea of using causal tracing to find minimal harmful circuits and applying targeted interventions (low-rank breakers, activation offsets). It effectively synthesizes concepts from the literature review, citing relevant papers (causal tracing, LoRA, activation steering, specific debiasing PEFTs) and explicitly aiming to tackle the identified key challenges like causal identification and targeted intervention without performance degradation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology follows a logical structure (Identification, Intervention, Validation). The descriptions of causal tracing, low-rank circuit breakers, and activation offsets are generally understandable, including the mathematical formulations. The evaluation plan is clear. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise method for combining causal tracing and saliency maps to ensure 'minimality' of circuits, and the exact formulation/effectiveness of the preservation regularizer in the low-rank approach could be slightly elaborated. However, these do not significantly hinder overall comprehension."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing existing techniques in a specific way. While causal tracing, activation steering, and low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are known methods (as per the literature review), the core novelty lies in using causal tracing to identify *minimal* circuits specifically responsible for *harm* and then applying highly targeted interventions (low-rank 'circuit breakers' or activation offsets) *only* to these identified components. This 'surgical' approach differs from broader methods like layer-wide low-rank mappings (FLORAIN) or general PEFT-based debiasing (BA-LoRA, PEFTDebias). The novelty stems from this specific combination and targeted application strategy, offering a potentially more precise way to control harms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established theoretical foundations (causal inference, PEFT, activation manipulation) and methods cited in the literature review (causal tracing, LoRA). The proposed methodology for circuit identification and intervention design is logical and technically plausible. The evaluation plan includes standard benchmarks, relevant baselines, and statistical analysis. The mathematical formulations are generally appropriate, although the causal effect definition is high-level and the preservation regularizer's specific form might need empirical validation. The inherent difficulty of perfect causal identification in complex NNs is acknowledged implicitly, but the approach itself is well-grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing techniques (causal tracing, PEFT) and standard datasets/benchmarks. The core intervention methods (low-rank adaptation, activation offsets) are designed for computational efficiency compared to full fine-tuning. Required resources (compute, models, datasets) are typical for contemporary ML research. Key risks involve the practical difficulty of isolating truly minimal causal circuits and ensuring interventions don't cause unforeseen negative impacts on model capabilities, but these are research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility blockers. The overall plan is realistic and implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: mitigating harmful outputs (bias, toxicity) from foundation models, a critical area for AI safety and responsible deployment. If successful, the proposed 'surgical' intervention method could offer a more precise, interpretable, and efficient approach than existing techniques, potentially leading to safer FMs with less degradation of general capabilities. The expected outcomes (causal circuit atlas, intervention framework, empirical validation) would be valuable contributions to the field and align perfectly with the MINT workshop's goals. The potential for both technical advancement and societal impact is substantial."
