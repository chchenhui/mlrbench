        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the MINT workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Interventions' (specifically activation engineering for targeted behavior editing - mitigating toxicity). It tackles the problem of harmful content generation, a key concern mentioned. Furthermore, it emphasizes a 'parameter-efficient' approach (<0.1% added parameters) via a lightweight network, fitting well with the 'Parameter-efficient fine-tuning' topic, even though it's an intervention method. The need to analyze intermediate activations also touches upon 'Understanding of foundation models'. The goal of context-aware control directly relates to improving controllability and disabling misuse."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of static interventions), the core proposal (input-conditioned activation edits via a separate network), the mechanism (activation analysis, sparse low-rank offsets), the training method (contrastive learning for harm reduction vs. utility preservation), and the expected outcomes (parameter efficiency, toxicity reduction, accuracy maintenance) are all clearly stated. The term 'adversarial network' is slightly ambiguous initially, but the description of the contrastive learning objective clarifies its role is more about counteracting harm than a traditional GAN setup. Minor refinements could enhance precision, but the core concept is understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While activation engineering itself is an existing field, the proposed method introduces significant innovation. The key novelty lies in using a separate, lightweight network to predict *dynamic, input-conditioned* activation interventions, moving beyond static edits. Training this modulator network via contrastive learning specifically to balance harm suppression and utility preservation in a context-aware manner is a fresh approach. Combining context-awareness, a dedicated modulator, contrastive training, and parameter efficiency for activation steering represents a novel contribution to the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Accessing intermediate activations is standard. Training a lightweight network is computationally tractable. Contrastive learning is a well-established paradigm. Implementing sparse, low-rank updates is feasible. Evaluation on standard benchmarks like ToxiGen and downstream tasks is practical. Potential challenges include curating appropriate data for the contrastive objective (balancing harmful examples with similar benign ones) and ensuring the learned modulator generalizes well across diverse contexts without negatively impacting unrelated capabilities. However, these challenges seem surmountable within typical ML research workflows."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Mitigating harmful generation from foundation models is a critical safety challenge. Current static intervention methods often lack the necessary nuance, leading to trade-offs between safety and utility. This proposal directly addresses this limitation by introducing context-awareness. A successful parameter-efficient method for dynamic, context-aware control over harmful outputs while preserving general utility would represent a major advancement in model safety and controllability, significantly impacting the responsible deployment of large models."
