        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns perfectly with the MINT workshop task description. It directly addresses the core themes: understanding foundation models (Bias Detection Module using probing), interventions (Adaptive Intervention Engine using activation engineering), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (using low-rank adaptations). The goal of mitigating biases directly relates to controlling undesirable content and promoting safer model behavior, which are central aims of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented very clearly with distinct components (Bias Detection, Intervention Engine, Evaluation Loop). The motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes are well-articulated. The specific techniques mentioned (probing, activation engineering, PEFT, RL) provide a concrete understanding of the proposed approach. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact implementation details of the RL agent and the real-time adaptation mechanism, but the overall concept is exceptionally clear and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "While individual components like bias probing, activation engineering, and PEFT are known areas of research, the novelty lies in their integration into a dynamic, adaptive framework. Specifically, using reinforcement learning to learn optimal, real-time intervention strategies that combine activation engineering and low-rank adaptations for bias mitigation represents a significant innovative step beyond static fine-tuning or predefined intervention rules. The concept of a continuously adapting system based on evaluation and feedback adds further originality."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Bias detection using probing, activation engineering, and PEFT are individually feasible techniques. However, integrating them into a real-time adaptive system controlled by reinforcement learning is complex. Training the RL agent effectively to balance bias mitigation with preserving general capabilities, ensuring the stability and efficiency of real-time interventions, and building the continuous evaluation loop pose considerable technical hurdles that require substantial research and engineering effort."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant problem: bias and harmful content generation in powerful foundation models. Developing effective, adaptive mitigation strategies is crucial for the responsible development and deployment of AI. Success in creating such a framework would represent a major advancement in AI safety and ethics, enhancing model trustworthiness and potentially enabling wider adoption in sensitive domains. The potential impact on the field and society is substantial."
