    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes: PAC-Bayes for interactive learning (specifically RL), deep learning methods, sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, handling distribution shift (non-stationarity), and developing practical algorithms. The proposal elaborates clearly on the initial research idea, outlining a specific methodology. It positions itself well relative to the cited literature (PBAC, PAC-Bayes SAC, time-uniform bounds), aiming to build upon them and address the identified key challenges like sample efficiency, exploration, and non-stationarity. All components are tightly integrated and consistent."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The mathematical formulations for the PAC-Bayes bound, KL divergence, and variational objective are presented clearly. The algorithmic steps provide a good overview of the proposed process. The exploration strategies (Thompson, UCB) are explained. Minor areas, like the precise mechanism for integrating the time-uniform bound into the objective or the exact method for estimating Q-value variance for UCB, could be slightly more detailed, but the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While leveraging existing PAC-Bayesian theory, variational inference, and time-uniform bounds, it proposes a novel synthesis: a unified framework where a PAC-Bayes bound is directly minimized for *policy optimization* in deep RL, and the resulting *posterior uncertainty* is explicitly used to guide exploration. This differs from prior work cited (PBAC focusing on critic error/ensembles, PAC-Bayes SAC on critic stability). The integration of time-uniform bounds specifically for non-stationarity within this policy optimization context also adds to the novelty. It's not entirely groundbreaking in terms of inventing new mathematical tools, but the proposed combination and application to policy optimization and exploration in RL are distinct and innovative."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, based on established theoretical foundations (PAC-Bayes, variational inference, time-uniform bounds). The methodology follows standard practices (variational optimization, reparameterization trick, principled exploration strategies). However, applying PAC-Bayes bounds, especially iteratively during policy optimization in an interactive (non-i.i.d.) setting, requires careful theoretical justification, even when referencing time-uniform bounds. The proposal acknowledges the need for time-uniform bounds for non-stationarity but the exact derivation and guarantees within the RL loop need rigorous proof. Estimating terms like the loss variance `V` or the Q-value variance for UCB can pose practical challenges that aren't fully detailed. The claimed sample complexity requires specific derivation for this setting. Overall, the approach is theoretically plausible but relies on non-trivial theoretical steps and careful implementation for full rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current deep RL techniques and computational resources. Variational inference, policy gradient methods, and exploration strategies like Thompson sampling are implementable. UCB requires variance estimation, adding complexity but feasible (e.g., via sampling). The experimental plan uses standard benchmarks and metrics. The computational cost might be higher than baselines due to posterior sampling/updates, but likely manageable in a research context. The 12-month timeline is ambitious but structured reasonably. Key risks involve the complexity of theoretical derivations and potential difficulties in tuning the algorithm to outperform highly optimized baselines, but the overall research plan is practical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses highly significant challenges in RL: sample inefficiency and the lack of theoretical guarantees, particularly for deep RL methods. By proposing a principled PAC-Bayesian approach to unify policy optimization, uncertainty quantification, and exploration, it has the potential for major impact. Success could lead to more data-efficient RL algorithms suitable for real-world applications (e.g., robotics), provide rigorous theoretical understanding (sample complexity guarantees), and contribute to safer RL through better uncertainty handling. It directly aligns with bridging theory and practice in interactive learning, as targeted by the workshop."
