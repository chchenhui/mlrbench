    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayes for interactive learning (specifically RL), sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation, and distribution shifts. The proposal elaborates clearly on the core research idea, outlining a PAC-Bayesian policy optimization framework with uncertainty-aware exploration. It effectively positions itself within the provided literature, citing relevant works (PBAC, PAC-Bayes SAC, time-uniform bounds) and aiming to extend them by directly optimizing the policy distribution bound and using posterior variance for exploration, rather than just bounding Bellman error or stabilizing the critic. It tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as sample efficiency and non-stationarity."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected impact are articulated logically and are generally easy to understand. The core concepts, such as using a PAC-Bayes bound as an objective and leveraging posterior variance for exploration, are explained well. The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise formulation of the 'PAC-Bayesian TD error' and the exact actor loss function within the algorithmic implementation section, which could benefit from slightly more detail, but overall the proposal is very clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing PAC-Bayesian theory, variational inference, and prior work in PAC-Bayes RL (PBAC, PAC-Bayes SAC), its core contribution is novel. Specifically, the idea of directly optimizing a PAC-Bayes bound over the *policy distribution* (as opposed to bounding Bellman error or stabilizing the critic) combined with using the *posterior variance* from this distribution as an explicit, theoretically motivated exploration bonus represents a fresh approach. Integrating time-uniform bounds (Chugg et al., 2023) into this specific framework to handle non-stationarity further enhances its novelty. It clearly distinguishes itself from the cited literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, grounded in established PAC-Bayesian theory and variational inference methods. The referenced theoretical work (Chugg et al., 2023) is appropriate. The core methodological ideas (optimizing a bound, using uncertainty for exploration) are conceptually sound. However, some aspects lack full rigor or detailed justification. For instance, the practical optimization of the PAC-Bayes objective (especially the KL term) can be challenging. The proposed mechanism for handling non-stationarity (periodically updating the prior) is somewhat heuristic and could benefit from stronger theoretical ties to the time-uniform bounds framework. The exact formulation of the proposed losses ('PAC-Bayesian TD error') needs further specification to fully assess technical correctness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current machine learning techniques and computational resources. Training Bayesian neural networks via variational inference and optimizing objectives via gradient descent are established practices, as is experimentation on Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks. However, potential challenges exist: Bayesian deep learning methods (like SGVI) can be computationally expensive and require careful tuning for stability. Optimizing the PAC-Bayes bound might introduce additional computational overhead or optimization difficulties. Achieving the specific target of 20-30% faster convergence is ambitious. While implementable, these factors introduce moderate risks regarding computational cost and achieving the stated performance gains smoothly."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses highly significant challenges in reinforcement learning: sample inefficiency and principled exploration, particularly crucial for real-world applications like robotics where data collection is costly or safety is paramount. Providing theoretical guarantees (via PAC-Bayes) for exploration and generalization in deep RL would be a major contribution. Developing a practical algorithm that demonstrably improves sample efficiency based on these principles would have substantial impact. The focus on non-stationarity further increases its relevance. Success would advance both the theory and practical application of RL significantly."
