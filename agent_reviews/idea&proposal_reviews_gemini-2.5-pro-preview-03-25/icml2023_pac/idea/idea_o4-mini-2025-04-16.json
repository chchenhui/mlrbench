        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses interactive learning (contextual bandits), uses PAC-Bayesian theory for analysis and algorithm development, and specifically targets PAC-Bayes bounds under distribution shift (non-stationarity). It also falls under the topic of developing practically useful interactive learning algorithms using PAC-Bayesian theory. The motivation and proposed method fit squarely within the workshop's scope and listed topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem (non-stationarity in bandits, lack of guarantees). The main idea outlines the proposed algorithm's components (dynamic priors, VI updates, action selection), the theoretical contribution (time-uniform PAC-Bayes bound for prior shifts), and the empirical validation plan. The concepts are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity, making the proposal immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While PAC-Bayes for bandits exists, the specific focus on non-stationary environments using dynamic, data-dependent priors formed by reweighting past posteriors is innovative. Deriving a time-uniform PAC-Bayes bound that explicitly handles these prior shifts represents a significant theoretical novelty. It offers a fresh perspective on applying PAC-Bayes to adaptivity in interactive learning, going beyond static priors or simpler adaptation mechanisms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. It leverages existing concepts like contextual bandits, PAC-Bayesian analysis, and variational inference. The algorithmic steps described (posterior updates, prior mixing, sampling) are generally implementable, although the variational inference step might require careful design and computational resources. The main challenge likely lies in the theoretical derivation of the novel PAC-Bayes bound, which requires expertise but is a standard type of contribution in the field. Empirical validation is also standard practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Non-stationarity is a pervasive challenge in real-world interactive systems, and developing algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees (like PAC-Bayes bounds) for such settings is crucial. This work could lead to more robust and sample-efficient recommendation systems, adaptive control systems, etc. Providing theoretical insights into how PAC-Bayes can handle distribution drift in interactive settings would be a major advancement for both theory and practice."
