        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayesian theory applied to interactive learning settings, specifically active learning. It proposes the 'Development of practically useful interactive learning algorithms using PAC-Bayesian theory', which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest. It combines deep learning, probabilistic methods (posterior distribution), sample efficiency concerns, and PAC-Bayesian analysis, all central themes mentioned in the workshop scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (limitations of heuristics, need for theoretical grounding) is explicit. The core proposal (PB-AL algorithm using PAC-Bayes bounds for query selection) is clearly articulated, including the mechanism (reducing generalization error bound via empirical error or KL term) and potential implementation details (MC Dropout/ensembles). The objective (sample efficiency, robust performance) is unambiguous. It is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While PAC-Bayes theory and active learning are established fields, and Bayesian methods have been used in active learning, the specific proposal to use the reduction of a PAC-Bayesian generalization error bound *directly* as the acquisition function for *deep* active learning is innovative. It moves beyond common heuristics (like uncertainty) or standard Bayesian active learning criteria (like BALD) by explicitly optimizing a quantity related to generalization guarantees derived from PAC-Bayes theory. This offers a fresh, theoretically grounded perspective on query selection."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some potential challenges. Maintaining posteriors via MC Dropout or ensembles is standard. Calculating or estimating PAC-Bayes bounds for deep models is an active research area but feasible techniques exist. The main challenge lies in the computational cost of evaluating the proposed acquisition function (expected reduction in the PAC-Bayes bound) for potentially many unlabeled data points. This might require approximations or efficient implementation strategies, making it more complex than simple uncertainty sampling, but it appears achievable with current methods and resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Sample efficiency is a critical bottleneck in deep learning, particularly when labeling is expensive. Active learning is a primary approach to mitigate this. Developing a deep active learning algorithm with stronger theoretical grounding based on PAC-Bayes generalization bounds, potentially leading to better sample efficiency and robustness than heuristic methods, would be a meaningful contribution to the field. Success could influence how active learning strategies are designed and analyzed."
