        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop call). It directly addresses the core theme of combining PAC-Bayesian theory with interactive learning (online, continual, RL) to improve sample efficiency, especially for deep learning methods. It explicitly targets key topics mentioned in the call, such as PAC-Bayesian analysis of exploration-exploitation, bounds under distribution shift and adversarial corruptions, and the development of practical algorithms using PAC-Bayesian theory. The motivation and goals resonate strongly with the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main idea, methodology (theory, algorithm design, evaluation), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The core concept of using PAC-Bayes bounds to optimize exploration-exploitation in deep interactive learning is immediately understandable. While the exact mechanisms for incorporating PAC-Bayes principles into deep networks are not fully detailed, this level of abstraction is appropriate for a research idea. It leaves very little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While PAC-Bayes, interactive learning, and deep learning are established fields, the specific combination and application proposed here – developing practical, sample-efficient *deep* interactive learning algorithms guided by PAC-Bayesian principles – is a relatively recent and active research direction. Applying PAC-Bayes beyond standard supervised learning to the complexities of interactive settings (like RL, continual learning) with deep models, particularly focusing on algorithm development alongside theoretical analysis, offers a fresh perspective aligned with the workshop's goal of fostering new ideas."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Developing tight and meaningful PAC-Bayesian bounds for complex interactive learning scenarios, especially under distribution shifts or adversarial corruptions and involving deep neural networks, can be theoretically demanding. Translating these theoretical bounds into practical algorithmic components that effectively guide exploration/exploitation in deep learning models without prohibitive computational overhead is also non-trivial. However, the components (theoretical analysis, deep learning implementation, empirical evaluation) are based on existing methodologies and tools, making the overall project achievable, albeit ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Sample efficiency is a critical bottleneck in many real-world interactive learning applications where data acquisition is expensive or time-consuming. Developing theoretically grounded methods based on PAC-Bayes to improve the sample efficiency of powerful deep interactive learning algorithms addresses a major challenge in the field. Success would lead to more practical and cost-effective learning systems and could provide valuable theoretical insights into the behavior of deep learning in interactive settings, aligning perfectly with the workshop's aims."
