        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's goal of leveraging physics structures (Hamiltonian mechanics, conservation laws) for ML, applicable to both scientific and classical problems. The methodology precisely implements the research idea of using symplectic integrators as network layers. It acknowledges and builds upon the cited literature (HNNs, symplectic methods, GNNs with conservation laws), positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape. The objectives, significance, and methodology all cohere perfectly with the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology is explained logically, with key concepts like Hamiltonian splitting and the Strang integrator clearly articulated, including mathematical formulations. The structure is easy to follow, progressing from background and objectives to detailed methods and evaluation. The language is precise and technical without being overly obscure. Minor details (e.g., specific network architectures for T and V) are omitted for brevity but the overall approach is immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the idea of symplectic neural networks exists in recent literature (as shown in the review), this proposal offers a specific, well-motivated architectural approach using Strang splitting integrators directly as layers. The key novelty lies in the proposed extension to graph-structured data by embedding Hamiltonian splitting within message-passing layers, which appears less explored. Furthermore, the aim to provide a unified framework and systematically evaluate it across diverse physics and classical ML tasks adds value. It's a strong synthesis and extension of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in Hamiltonian mechanics and the well-established theory of symplectic integrators (specifically Strang splitting). The methodology is technically well-founded; the use of splitting methods guarantees symplecticity by construction (up to numerical precision). The parameterization of the Hamiltonian and the gradient calculations for the updates are correctly described for separable systems. The extension to graphs via pairwise potentials is standard practice in physics modeling. The evaluation plan includes appropriate metrics and baselines. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. A minor limitation is the implicit focus on separable Hamiltonians, not explicitly addressing non-separable cases mentioned as a challenge in the literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. The required methods (neural network training, automatic differentiation, symplectic integration steps) are achievable with standard ML frameworks like PyTorch or JAX. The necessary data comes from established benchmarks or simulations that are standard in the field. The architectural components (Hamiltonian parameterization, splitting layers, graph message passing) are complex but well-defined and build on existing concepts. Potential challenges like computational cost and training stability are acknowledged, and mitigation strategies (gradient clipping, evaluating cost) are mentioned. The plan appears realistic within a typical research project scope."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical problem of enforcing physical conservation laws in deep learning models, which is crucial for reliable scientific simulations and potentially beneficial for improving stability and generalization in classical ML tasks involving dynamics. Success would lead to more trustworthy ML models for science, potentially reducing reliance on expensive solvers. It directly contributes to the physics-informed ML field and the workshop's theme by providing a concrete method for embedding physical structure. The potential for cross-disciplinary innovation (applying these ideas beyond physics) is substantial."
