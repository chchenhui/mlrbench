        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of exploiting structures (geometric conservation laws, symmetries from Hamiltonian mechanics) and insights from physics to construct novel machine learning methods (symplectic neural networks). It explicitly aims to embed fundamental laws (conservation laws) into ML systems, aligning with the provided examples (Hamiltonian NNs) and listed topics (Physics-inspired ML, ML with physics-based inductive bias). The idea also considers applications in both physical sciences (molecular dynamics) and classical ML (video prediction), matching the workshop's scope and addressing the question of applying physics perspectives to classical ML problems."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (lack of physical invariants in NNs), the core proposal (symplectic architectures via Hamiltonian splitting), the mechanism (layers as symplectic maps preserving invariants), and potential applications/impact are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The technical concepts (symplectic maps, Hamiltonian splitting) are appropriately contextualized within the neural network framework. It clearly outlines what will be designed and why."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality and innovation. While the fields of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs), and Symplectic Neural Networks (SNNs) exist, this proposal focuses specifically on using Hamiltonian splitting methods as a core architectural principle for designing layers that *inherently* preserve invariants. This structural enforcement contrasts with softer constraints often used in PINNs and offers a specific, structured approach within the broader HNN/SNN research area. It combines established concepts from geometric mechanics (symplectic integration, splitting methods) with deep learning architectures in a fresh way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The theoretical underpinnings (Hamiltonian mechanics, symplectic integrators, splitting methods) are well-established in physics and numerical analysis. Implementing these structures as neural network layers requires careful design, potentially custom layer implementations, and ensuring compatibility with automatic differentiation frameworks. Training networks with such strong architectural constraints might also pose optimization challenges or require specific techniques. However, prior work on HNNs/SNNs demonstrates that such approaches are viable, suggesting feasibility with dedicated effort and expertise in both ML and physics."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the lack of physical consistency in standard NNs is critical for their reliable application in science and engineering (e.g., long-term simulations). Enforcing conservation laws inherently can lead to more robust, data-efficient, and physically plausible models. Beyond scientific applications, leveraging conservation principles as inductive biases could improve stability and generalization in classical ML tasks like time-series or video prediction. Success would represent a major advancement in bridging physics and ML, leading to more trustworthy AI."
