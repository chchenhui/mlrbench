    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of Intrinsically Motivated Open-Ended Learning (IMOL) mentioned in the task description, such as adaptive goal creation, generalization, and lifelong learning. The methodology faithfully implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea (hierarchical structure, contextual goal generation via meta-RL/attention, skill library, few-shot transfer). Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review (Dynamic Goal Adaptation, Exploration/Exploitation, Skill Transfer) and positions itself appropriately relative to the cited works (h-DQN, HIDIO)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, the hierarchical architecture is described logically, and the algorithmic components (lower-level SAC, meta-level PPO with attention, MAML for transfer) are explained with relevant equations. The experimental design (environments, baselines, metrics, protocol) is clearly outlined. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of the environmental statistics (h_i) used for context and the specifics of the skill metadata (\\phi_z) and similarity search, but these do not significantly hinder overall understanding."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several advanced concepts (HRL, IM, meta-RL, attention mechanisms, skill libraries, MAML) in a specific configuration to address contextual goal generation for lifelong learning. While individual components are known, their integration—particularly the use of an attention-based meta-controller analyzing environmental statistics to dynamically adapt intrinsic goals within an HRL framework combined with MAML-based skill transfer—represents a novel approach compared to the cited baselines (h-DQN's fixed goals, HIDIO's entropy focus, flat curiosity). It's not entirely groundbreaking but offers a fresh perspective and combination."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (HRL, IM via prediction error, SAC, PPO, Attention, MAML). The proposed methodology is logical, combining these elements in a coherent way. The mathematical formulations for the core algorithms appear correct. The choice of meta-reward (sum of lower-level intrinsic rewards) is reasonable. The overall approach is well-justified by the literature and the problem statement. Potential minor weaknesses might lie in the practical details of feature engineering for the context vector (h_i) and ensuring stable learning in the complex integrated system, but the core concepts are sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating HRL, meta-RL, attention, a dynamic skill library, and MAML into a single working system is highly complex and computationally demanding. Training such a system, especially in 3D environments, will require substantial computational resources and careful tuning. The proposal acknowledges computational cost and suggests standard mitigations (distributed training, parameter sharing), but the overall complexity remains high. Success requires significant engineering effort and expertise across multiple ML subfields. While conceptually achievable, practical implementation poses considerable hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and challenging problem in AI: enabling autonomous agents to learn continuously and adaptively in open-ended environments. This is central to the IMOL field and crucial for real-world applications like robotics. Successfully developing a system that can dynamically generate contextual goals and transfer skills effectively would be a major advancement. The research has the potential for substantial impact, contributing both algorithmic innovations and a deeper understanding of lifelong learning principles. The plan to provide code and benchmarks further enhances its potential contribution to the research community."
