    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges of Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning (IMOL) outlined in the task description, such as the need for adaptive goal creation, incremental learning, and generalization in dynamic environments. The proposed ACGG framework directly implements the research idea's concepts (contextual goal generation, hierarchy, skill library). Furthermore, the proposal explicitly identifies and aims to tackle the key challenges (dynamic goals, exploration/exploitation, skill retention, scalability) highlighted in the provided literature review, positioning itself as a direct response to these limitations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology, experiments, and impact. Key components like the hierarchical architecture, intrinsic reward, learning progress metric, contextual goal generator, and skill library are explained with supporting equations and an algorithm outline. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of abstract goal descriptors, the specifics of the context encoder architecture, and the exact criteria for adding skills to the library, but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed approach at this stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing concepts like HRL, IM (prediction error), meta-learning, and skill libraries, its novelty lies in the specific integration and mechanisms proposed. The core innovation is the Adaptive Contextual Goal Generation (ACGG), particularly the use of an attention-based context encoder to make goal generation sensitive to recent environmental statistics, and the use of 'learning progress' on intrinsic rewards as a meta-objective to explicitly balance exploration and exploitation. This combination, aimed at dynamic adaptation and lifelong learning, offers a fresh perspective distinct from the cited prior works (h-DQN, HIDIO, Self-play sub-goals)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages well-established foundations in RL, HRL, IM, meta-learning, and deep learning (attention mechanisms, policy gradients). The proposed two-level hierarchy, prediction-error based intrinsic motivation, and PPO for meta-policy training are standard and appropriate. The mathematical formulations for key components like learning progress and skill transfer initialization are provided and appear correct. Potential challenges related to training stability for the complex integrated system and the empirical effectiveness of the learning progress signal are acknowledged implicitly as research questions, but the overall methodological approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and standard deep RL research resources. The required environments (Habitat, MuJoCo) and algorithms (PPO, Actor-Critic, Transformers) are commonly used. However, integrating all components (hierarchy, meta-learning, context encoder, forward model, skill library) presents significant engineering complexity and potential training stability challenges, common in ambitious deep RL projects. The experimental plan is concrete, but achieving robust performance and demonstrating clear advantages over strong baselines will require considerable effort and tuning. The risks are manageable but non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in current AI agents concerning autonomy, adaptability, and lifelong learning in open-ended environments â€“ core goals highlighted in the task description for the IMOL field. By aiming to create agents that can dynamically set their own goals based on context and learning progress, the research has the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous systems, particularly for robotics and AI assistants operating in complex, real-world scenarios. Success would reduce reliance on hand-engineered rewards and contribute valuable insights and tools (code, libraries) to the research community."
