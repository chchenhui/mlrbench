    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of creating autonomous, intrinsically motivated agents capable of open-ended learning in dynamic environments, as outlined in the task description. The ACORN framework is a detailed realization of the research idea, incorporating the hierarchical structure, contextual goal generation via meta-RL and attention, and skill library concepts. Furthermore, it explicitly targets key challenges identified in the literature review, such as Dynamic Goal Adaptation, Exploration/Exploitation Balancing, and Skill Retention/Transfer, while building upon concepts from cited HRL and IMOL works."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, clearly outlining the background, objectives, significance, methodology (ACORN architecture, low/high-level controllers, skill library, experimental design), and expected outcomes. Key concepts like context features, meta-rewards, and the roles of different components are explained well. The technical aspects, including the use of specific algorithms (RND, SAC/PPO, Attention) and mathematical notation for intrinsic reward, are presented clearly. The experimental plan is detailed and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While utilizing existing components like HRL, intrinsic motivation (RND), meta-RL, and attention mechanisms, the core novelty lies in their specific integration to achieve *adaptive contextual goal generation*. The explicit use of diverse environmental statistics (context features) analyzed via an attention mechanism within a meta-RL framework to dynamically modulate intrinsic goal selection appears innovative within the IMOL context. This directly addresses the challenge of static goal-setting mechanisms prevalent in prior work and offers a fresh perspective on dynamic adaptation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations in RL, HRL, intrinsic motivation, and meta-RL. The proposed ACORN architecture is technically plausible, leveraging standard algorithms (SAC/PPO, RND) and techniques (attention). The methodology, including the definition of low-level and high-level controllers, the meta-reward structure (cumulative intrinsic reward), and the skill library concept, is well-reasoned. Potential challenges like defining effective context features and potential meta-RL instability are inherent to the approach but do not undermine the fundamental soundness. The technical formulations presented are appropriate."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It relies on standard ML/RL libraries and simulation environments. However, successfully implementing and integrating the hierarchical structure, context feature extraction, attention mechanism, meta-RL loop, and skill library requires significant engineering effort. Tuning the meta-RL process and identifying robust context features across different environments can be complex and computationally intensive, posing potential risks to achieving optimal performance within a typical project scope. The plan is realistic, but execution requires careful management of these complexities."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical bottleneck in IMOL and autonomous agent development: the inability of agents to dynamically adapt their learning objectives to changing environmental contexts. Success would represent a major advancement towards truly open-ended, lifelong learning agents. The potential impact spans scientific understanding (modeling adaptive exploration, informing cognitive science) and technological applications (more robust robotics, adaptive AI systems). It directly addresses the core aims of the IMOL field as described in the task description."
