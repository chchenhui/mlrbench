    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges of Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning (IMOL) outlined in the task description, such as generalization, adaptive goal creation/switching, and incremental learning. The methodology section provides a detailed implementation plan for the research idea, elaborating on the hierarchical structure, contextual goal generation via meta-RL, skill library, and dynamic switching. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (h-DQN, Sukhbaatar et al., HIDIO) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the literature review (dynamic goal adaptation, exploration/exploitation balance, skill transfer, scalability)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the hierarchical architecture, including the meta-level and low-level components, is described in detail with supporting mathematical formulations. The experimental design is well-articulated, specifying environments, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise implementation details of the attention mechanism and the exact calculation for the 'Progressive Complexity' reward (R_{\\\\text{adapt}}). Additionally, there is a minor typo ('恢复至') in the metrics section. However, these points do not significantly obscure the overall proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it builds upon existing concepts like hierarchical RL (h-DQN), self-play goal generation (Sukhbaatar et al.), intrinsic motivation mechanisms (prediction error, empowerment), and skill libraries, its core novelty lies in the specific integration and application of these ideas. The use of meta-RL to *contextually* generate goals based on *explicitly defined environmental statistics* (predictability, complexity, resource scarcity) via an attention mechanism, coupled with dynamic, context-dependent switching between exploration and exploitation, represents a fresh approach compared to the cited works and standard IMOL methods. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on this adaptive, statistics-driven goal modulation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established RL principles (HRL, meta-RL, policy gradients) and common intrinsic motivation techniques. The proposed hierarchical architecture is appropriate for the problem, and the use of meta-learning for goal adaptation is theoretically justified. The choice of environmental statistics as contextual input is plausible, although their effectiveness requires empirical validation. The intrinsic reward formulation combines standard measures. The experimental design is robust, featuring relevant baselines, metrics, and ablations. Minor weaknesses include the need for more detailed justification or definition for the R_{\\\\text{adapt}} term and the specific attention mechanism used. Overall, the methodology is well-defined and technically coherent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant engineering challenges. Implementing and training a complex system involving hierarchical meta-RL, attention mechanisms, environmental statistics estimation, combined intrinsic rewards, and a skill library requires substantial expertise and computational resources (likely significant GPU time). Tuning the numerous hyperparameters (\\lambda, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, learning rates, network architectures, \\\\tau_{\\\\text{food}}) will be demanding. The procedural generation of environments helps with data, but extensive interaction is still needed. While achievable within a well-equipped research setting, the complexity introduces non-trivial risks related to convergence, stability, and scalability."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in current AI, particularly the inability of agents to learn autonomously, adaptively, and continuously in dynamic, open-ended environments – a core goal highlighted in the task description. By proposing a concrete mechanism for contextual goal adaptation and lifelong skill accumulation within the IMOL framework, it tackles fundamental challenges in RL and autonomous systems. Success would represent a major advancement in creating more versatile and human-like learning agents, with substantial potential impact on robotics, autonomous vehicles, personalized education, and other domains requiring long-term adaptation without constant supervision."
