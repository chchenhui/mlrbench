    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the core themes of Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning (IMOL), focusing on adaptive goal creation/switching, incremental learning, generalization, and lifelong learning without predefined signals, which are explicitly mentioned as key challenges and goals in the task description. The motivation aligns perfectly with the task's emphasis on overcoming the limitations of current IM agents for real-world autonomy."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It defines the problem (limitations of static goals), proposes a specific hierarchical architecture (lower-level skills, meta-level goal generation), outlines the mechanism (contextual adaptation via environmental stats and attention), mentions integration with incremental learning, and suggests a validation strategy. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise nature of the 'environmental statistics' and the specific implementation details of the meta-RL goal generator and few-shot transfer, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like HRL, intrinsic motivation, meta-RL, and skill libraries exist, the proposed synthesis is innovative. Specifically, the concept of a meta-learner *adaptively generating* intrinsic goals based on *contextual environmental statistics* (using attention) to dynamically shift between exploration/exploitation strategies within a lifelong learning framework presents a fresh perspective compared to static goal spaces or simpler goal-conditioning methods. The integration with incremental learning and few-shot transfer further enhances its novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current machine learning techniques. Hierarchical RL, meta-RL, attention mechanisms, and curiosity modules are established research areas. However, implementing and training such a complex, multi-level system presents significant engineering challenges, including sample efficiency, stability, defining and extracting meaningful environmental statistics, and tuning the interplay between the levels. Validation in complex, procedurally generated environments also requires substantial computational resources and careful experimental design. It's ambitious but achievable with state-of-the-art methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it tackles fundamental challenges in creating autonomous, adaptable, and lifelong learning agents â€“ a central goal in AI and robotics, explicitly highlighted in the task description. Overcoming the limitations of static intrinsic motivation could lead to major advancements in agent versatility and robustness in dynamic, open-ended environments. Success would represent a substantial contribution to the fields of reinforcement learning, developmental robotics, and artificial general intelligence, aligning perfectly with the aims of the IMOL community."
