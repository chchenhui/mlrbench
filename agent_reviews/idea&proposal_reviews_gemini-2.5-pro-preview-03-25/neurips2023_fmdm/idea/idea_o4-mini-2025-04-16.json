    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses one of the central challenges highlighted: 'Foundation models are trained on data without actions. How to overcome this limitation from both the dataset and modeling perspectives?'. The proposed 'Sim2Act' method focuses explicitly on generating action-annotated data using simulators to fine-tune foundation models for decision-making. It aligns perfectly with topics like 'Foundation model agents interacting with... simulators', 'Applying foundation models to traditional decision making problems in control, planning...', 'Learning multi-modal, multi-task... policies', and 'New evaluation protocols, benchmarks, datasets... that apply foundation models to solve decision making problems'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (action data gap), the core mechanism (simulation-based generation of (observation, language, action) triplets using an exploratory FM policy), the training objective (fine-tuning a VLM+action head via contrastive learning and behavior cloning), and the iterative improvement loop are well-explained. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specifics of the 'base foundation model' used for initial exploration or the exact implementation details of the iterative bootstrapping, but the overall concept and workflow are clearly presented and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using simulators for data generation (Sim2Real) and fine-tuning large models are established techniques, the specific combination proposed here is innovative. Leveraging foundation models themselves to drive exploration in simulation for generating action-conditioned data, specifically targeting the (observation, language, action) triplet format for multi-modal decision-making models, and incorporating an iterative self-improvement loop for data generation and policy refinement offers a fresh perspective. It's a novel synthesis of existing ideas tailored to address the specific action data gap for foundation models in decision-making contexts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible with current technology and resources. It relies on existing simulation environments, foundation models (VLMs), and standard machine learning training techniques (fine-tuning, BC, contrastive learning). The main requirements are access to diverse simulators and significant computational resources for simulation and model training, which are standard for research in this area. Potential challenges include ensuring the diversity and quality of the generated data, managing the computational cost of large-scale simulation and training, and potentially tuning the iterative process to ensure convergence towards useful behaviors, but there are no obvious fundamental roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Addressing the 'actions gap' is crucial for enabling powerful foundation models to be effectively applied to sequential decision-making tasks like planning, control, and robotics, as highlighted in the task description. Successfully generating large-scale, high-quality, action-conditioned data could dramatically improve the sample efficiency and generalization capabilities of FM-based agents in interactive settings. This could lead to major advancements in robotics, autonomous systems, and other areas requiring embodied intelligence, making it a potentially high-impact contribution."
