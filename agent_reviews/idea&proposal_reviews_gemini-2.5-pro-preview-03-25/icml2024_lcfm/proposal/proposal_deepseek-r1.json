    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop on LCFM efficiency), the research idea (attention-guided dynamic KV cache compression), and the literature review (building upon and differentiating from FastKV, DynamicKV, KV-Distill). It directly addresses the core problem of KV cache memory consumption in LCFMs, a key topic for the workshop, and proposes a method consistent with the provided idea. It acknowledges and aims to improve upon related work identified in the literature review, tackling the challenge of adaptive compression."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, objectives are well-defined, and the core methodology (attention tracking, dynamic pruning/quantization) is explained with formulas. The experimental plan is detailed with datasets, metrics, baselines, and hardware. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact source of attention scores (layer/head averaging?), the specific cache reorganization mechanism, the handling of initial attention scores, and the precise nature and necessity of the 'compression-aware fine-tuning', but these do not significantly obscure the overall research direction."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like KV cache compression, attention scores, pruning, and quantization exist, the specific combination of using a *decaying average of historical attention scores* to dynamically guide *both* token pruning *and* variable-bit quantization during inference appears novel compared to the cited literature. It differs from FastKV's selective propagation, DynamicKV's layer-level adaptation, and KV-Distill's learned approach. It represents a fresh perspective on adaptive compression, though it builds upon existing primitives rather than being entirely groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. The core idea of prioritizing tokens based on historical attention is intuitive and theoretically grounded. The methodology uses standard techniques (moving averages, thresholding, proportional scaling) in a logical way. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. However, the proposal lacks discussion on the potential computational overhead of tracking attention scores for every token, which could impact latency gains. Additionally, the role and specifics of 'compression-aware fine-tuning' are underdeveloped, potentially complicating the method's practical application if extensive fine-tuning becomes necessary for good performance."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Implementing attention tracking and dynamic cache modifications requires significant engineering effort within transformer libraries but is achievable with current expertise. The required hardware (A100 GPUs, Jetson for edge tests) is standard for this type of research. The main risks involve the potential computational overhead negating efficiency gains and the ambitious performance targets (50-80% compression with >90% performance retention). Access to specific proprietary models like GPT-3 might pose a challenge unless open versions are used. Overall, the plan is generally realistic with manageable technical risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses the critical bottleneck of KV cache memory consumption, which severely limits the deployment and scalability of Long-Context Foundation Models. Successfully developing an efficient, attention-guided compression technique would enable LCFM deployment on resource-constrained devices (edge AI), reduce computational costs and energy consumption, and broaden access to powerful AI capabilities. It directly tackles a key challenge in the field with potential for substantial technical and practical impact."
