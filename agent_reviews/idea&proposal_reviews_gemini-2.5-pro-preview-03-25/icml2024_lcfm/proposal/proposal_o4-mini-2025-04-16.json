    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop on LCFM efficiency), the research idea (attention-guided dynamic KV cache compression), and the literature review (situating the idea among existing compression techniques like FastKV, DynamicKV, KV-Distill). It directly addresses the core challenge of KV cache memory consumption in LCFMs, a key topic for the workshop, and elaborates comprehensively on the proposed idea, referencing relevant prior work identified in the literature review as baselines."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology is broken down into logical, understandable components (attention aggregation, scoring, adaptive compression, techniques) with mathematical formulation and pseudocode provided. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, metrics, and validation strategy, is detailed and unambiguous. Expected outcomes are quantified. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like KV cache compression, quantization, pruning, and using attention scores exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the specific approach of using *historical cumulative attention* scores across layers to dynamically guide a *combination* of compression techniques (quantization bits, pruning probability, eviction schedule) at a fine-grained token/block level appears novel. It distinguishes itself from layer-budget methods (DynamicKV), selective propagation (FastKV), and learned static compressors (KV-Distill) by its adaptive, attention-history-driven, multi-faceted compression strategy during inference."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on the reasonable theoretical foundation that attention history correlates with token importance. The methodology is well-structured, combining established techniques (quantization, pruning) in a novel adaptive framework. The mathematical formulation for attention aggregation is provided, and the evaluation plan is comprehensive and rigorous, including baselines, ablations, and statistical testing. Minor weaknesses include the need for more detail on the fallback mechanism for pruned tokens and the specifics of learning/setting thresholds, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Implementation within standard frameworks (PyTorch, HuggingFace) is practical. The required datasets are standard benchmarks. While evaluating on very long contexts requires significant compute resources, this is standard for the field. The overhead of tracking attention scores is acknowledged and seems manageable (O(T) memory). The main challenges lie in careful implementation and hyperparameter tuning (tiers, thresholds, compression configs), which are typical research tasks. The risks are manageable, making the project practical to execute."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the field: the prohibitive memory and latency costs associated with the KV cache in long-context foundation models. Successfully reducing the KV cache footprint by 50-75% with minimal performance loss, as targeted, would be a major advancement. It could enable LCFM deployment on resource-constrained devices, extend practical context lengths, and reduce operational costs. The potential impact on both research and practical application of LCFMs is substantial."
