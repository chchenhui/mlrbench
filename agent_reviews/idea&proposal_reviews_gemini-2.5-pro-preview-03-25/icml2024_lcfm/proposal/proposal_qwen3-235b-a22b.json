    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (focusing on efficiency techniques for Long-Context Foundation Models), the research idea (implementing attention-guided dynamic KV cache compression), and the literature review (building upon and differentiating from existing methods like FastKV, DynamicKV, etc.). It directly addresses the KV cache bottleneck identified as a key challenge and fits perfectly within the workshop's scope."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology (including equations and pseudocode), and experimental plan are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow, and there is minimal ambiguity regarding the core concepts and evaluation strategy. The problem definition and proposed solution are immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While dynamic KV cache compression and using attention scores for importance are known concepts (as evidenced by the literature review), the specific approach of using *aggregated historical attention scores with exponential decay* to dynamically guide *both* quantization bitwidth *and* probabilistic pruning per token/block appears distinct. It's a novel combination and refinement of existing ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept, but it clearly differentiates itself from the cited baselines like FastKV (selective propagation) and DynamicKV (layer budgeting)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. The core idea of leveraging attention history as a proxy for token importance is well-founded in attention mechanism literature. The proposed methodology uses standard techniques (quantization, pruning) guided by a clearly defined metric (aggregated attention score). The mathematical formulations are presented, and the experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Minor points like the determination of the layer weight w_l could be further specified, but the overall approach is technically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Implementing attention tracking, dynamic quantization, and pruning is achievable with current deep learning frameworks. The plan acknowledges potential overhead and proposes mitigation (block-wise processing). Required resources (LCFMs, GPUs, datasets) are standard for this research area. While engineering effort will be needed to optimize the implementation for minimal latency impact, the core research plan is realistic and implementable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the KV cache memory bottleneck, which is a major impediment to scaling LCFMs to longer contexts and deploying them on resource-constrained hardware. If successful in achieving the claimed 3-5x compression with minimal performance loss, the research would have a substantial practical impact, enabling new applications and wider accessibility of LCFMs. The potential contributions to efficiency benchmarks and understanding attention dynamics are also significant."
