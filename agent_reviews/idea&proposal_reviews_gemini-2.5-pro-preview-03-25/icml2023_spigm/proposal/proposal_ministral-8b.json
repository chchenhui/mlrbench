    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for structured data (graphs) using probabilistic methods (Bayesian GNNs). It logically expands on the research idea, detailing the proposed architecture and methodology. Furthermore, it clearly positions itself within the context of the provided literature review, acknowledging existing methods (ensembles, post-hoc, conformal, SDEs) and aiming to tackle key challenges identified, such as integrating UQ directly into the GNN architecture and distinguishing uncertainty types."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, significance, and overall methodology are presented logically. The algorithmic steps and experimental design are understandable at a high level. However, some technical details lack precision. For instance, the exact mechanism for how uncertainty parameters 'propagate and transform' alongside features needs more elaboration. The mathematical formulation for the uncertainty-aware attention mechanism (A_u = \\\\text{softmax}(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{u}_i \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u}_j}{\\\\sqrt{d}})) seems overly simplistic or potentially requires clarification on what \\\\mathbf{u}_i represents and how this interaction captures uncertainty weighting. While generally well-structured, these specific areas could benefit from refinement for complete clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Bayesian GNNs and UQ techniques exist (as shown in the literature review), the core idea of integrating learnable uncertainty parameters directly into the message-passing mechanism, having them propagate layer-wise, maintaining distributions over features throughout, and using specialized uncertainty-aware attention appears to be a novel combination. It distinguishes itself from ensemble methods, post-hoc approaches, SDEs, and conformal prediction methods discussed in the literature. The specific architectural integration and propagation mechanism for uncertainty seems to be the main innovative aspect, offering a potentially fresh perspective on Bayesian GNNs for UQ."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, grounded in established principles like Bayesian inference, variational inference (VI), and GNNs. However, it has some weaknesses in the details provided. Using VI and maintaining distributions is theoretically sound but computationally demanding. The proposal lacks specifics on how the learnable uncertainty parameters (\\theta_u, \\theta_a, \\theta_e) are parameterized and learned effectively to achieve the desired separation and propagation. The mathematical formulation for the attention mechanism is questionable as presented and needs significant clarification or revision to be technically convincing. While the overall direction is plausible, the lack of technical depth and potential flaws in specific formulations reduce the score for soundness and rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Bayesian methods, particularly VI for deep models like GNNs involving maintaining and propagating distributions, are computationally intensive. Implementing custom Bayesian layers with these features requires substantial engineering effort and expertise. Scalability to large graphs (e.g., social networks) is a major concern, despite being listed as an expected outcome, as the proposal doesn't detail how this will be achieved given the likely overhead. Training stability and convergence of the complex VI scheme are also potential risks. While possible with current tools, the practical hurdles related to computation, complexity, and scalability are considerable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of reliable uncertainty quantification in GNNs, which hinders their adoption in high-stakes decision-making domains (e.g., medicine, finance, critical infrastructure). Developing a method that integrates UQ deeply into the GNN architecture and provides well-calibrated, interpretable (aleatoric vs. epistemic) uncertainty estimates would be a major contribution. Success would significantly enhance the trustworthiness, robustness, and applicability of GNNs, aligning perfectly with the need for reliable AI systems highlighted in the task description."
