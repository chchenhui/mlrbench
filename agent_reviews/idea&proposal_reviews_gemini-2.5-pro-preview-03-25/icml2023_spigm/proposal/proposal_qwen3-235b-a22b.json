    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (focusing on probabilistic inference, UQ, structured data like graphs, scalability, applications, and empirical analysis), the research idea (Bayesian GNNs, integrated UQ, uncertainty separation, attention, validation), and the literature review (addressing key challenges like integration, separation, scalability, OOD handling). It directly tackles the core themes and uses the provided context effectively to motivate the research objectives and methodology."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, significance, and overall framework are well-defined. The methodology section provides specific formulations and a detailed experimental plan. Minor ambiguities exist in the exact derivation/justification of the covariance update formula and the precise mechanism for separating aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty using the proposed learnable parameters (\\\\\\\\sigma_{\\\\\\\\text{act}}, \\\\\\\\tau), which could benefit from slight refinement for full reproducibility."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Bayesian GNNs and variational inference are established concepts, the specific approach of integrating uncertainty propagation directly into the message-passing mechanism with layer-wise mean/covariance updates, combined with uncertainty-aware attention tailored to this framework, offers a fresh perspective. It distinguishes itself from recent post-hoc methods, ensemble techniques, and SDE-based approaches highlighted in the literature review. The novelty lies more in the specific integrated formulation rather than introducing entirely new concepts."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, based on established principles of Bayesian inference and GNNs. However, there are weaknesses in the technical rigor of the methodology description. The covariance propagation formula requires stronger justification or derivation. The proposed mechanism for separating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty by parameterizing \\\\\\\\sigma_{\\\\\\\\text{act}} and \\\\\\\\tau seems potentially conflated with prior/activation noise and needs clearer theoretical grounding regarding how it distinctly captures aleatoric vs. epistemic sources compared to standard approaches (e.g., likelihood variance for aleatoric, weight posterior for epistemic). The evaluation plan is rigorous, but the core methodological formulation has some unclear aspects."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents implementation challenges. Implementing variational inference with mean/covariance propagation in GNNs requires significant expertise and careful engineering. Training can be computationally intensive and potentially unstable, although the proposal acknowledges this by specifying adequate hardware (A100 GPUs) and optimization strategies (AdamW, local reparameterization). Standard datasets and baselines are used. The main risks involve implementation complexity, training stability, and achieving the claimed efficiency gains over ensembles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of reliable uncertainty quantification in GNNs, which hinders their adoption in high-stakes domains. Developing GNNs that provide well-calibrated and interpretable uncertainty estimates, especially for OOD detection, would be a major advancement. The potential impact on applications like drug discovery, traffic forecasting, and social network analysis is substantial and clearly articulated. The research directly tackles critical limitations identified in the field."
