        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses generative modeling for structured data (graphs, time series implied via examples like molecules and trajectories), which is a core topic. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the challenge of encoding domain knowledge (constraints) into these models, a key emphasis mentioned in the task description. The goal of enhancing utility in scientific discovery also aligns perfectly with the scope item 'Applications and practical implementations of existing methods to areas in science'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation (generating valid structured data) and the core technical proposal (modifying the reverse diffusion step via projection or score modification based on constraints) are clearly explained. Examples like chemically valid molecules and physically possible trajectories effectively illustrate the concept. While the exact mathematical formulation or implementation details of the projection/constraint term are not fully specified, the overall concept and approach are understandable with only minor ambiguities inherent in a concise research idea description."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While incorporating constraints into generative models isn't entirely new, applying this specifically within the score-based/diffusion model framework by modifying the reverse sampling process (via manifold projection or score adjustment) is a relatively fresh approach. Score-based models for structured data are an active area, and integrating domain constraints directly into the sampling dynamics, rather than just post-hoc filtering or simple conditioning, offers a notable contribution. It combines existing concepts (score models, constraint satisfaction) in an innovative way for this specific problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Score-based models are computationally intensive but well-established. The main challenge lies in implementing the constraint incorporation: defining the constraint manifold and performing efficient projection, or formulating differentiable constraint terms. Gradient projection is a feasible approximation. Differentiable representations of domain rules exist for some scientific domains (e.g., physics-based energy functions) but might be difficult to formulate or computationally expensive for complex constraints. Success likely depends on the specific domain and the nature of its constraints, but the proposed approaches (approximation, differentiable terms) suggest viable paths forward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Generating structured data that adheres to domain-specific rules (physical laws, chemical valency, etc.) is a critical bottleneck limiting the practical application of generative models in many scientific and engineering fields (e.g., drug discovery, materials science, robotics). Successfully encoding these constraints directly into the generative process, as proposed, could drastically improve the validity and utility of generated samples, potentially leading to major advancements and accelerating scientific discovery by providing more reliable generative tools."
