    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the workshop scope: 'Inference and generating methods for graphs', 'Uncertainty quantification in AI systems', and 'Applications and practical implementations... to areas in science' (e.g., drug discovery). The focus on Bayesian GNNs fits squarely within 'Structured Probabilistic Inference' for graph data."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation for uncertainty quantification in GNNs is well-established, and the proposed approach (Bayesian GNN framework, variational inference, propagating uncertainty parameters, distinguishing uncertainty types, uncertainty-aware attention) is described with sufficient detail to understand the core concepts. While specific implementation details (e.g., exact parameterization, VI objective) are not fully elaborated, the overall research direction and methodology are clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While Bayesian GNNs and uncertainty quantification for GNNs are existing research areas, the proposed method of integrating learnable uncertainty parameters directly into the message-passing layers, propagating them alongside features, and using uncertainty-aware attention offers a potentially innovative approach. It builds upon existing concepts but proposes a specific, integrated mechanism for uncertainty propagation and utilization within the GNN architecture, distinguishing it from methods that treat UQ as a post-hoc step or only apply Bayesian principles to weights."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It leverages established techniques like Graph Neural Networks and Variational Inference. Implementing VI within GNN layers is challenging and likely computationally intensive, requiring careful engineering and potentially significant resources for training and inference. However, it is within the realm of current ML research capabilities. The proposed experimental validation on standard graph datasets (molecular, traffic, social) is practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Providing reliable and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for GNN predictions is crucial for deploying these models in high-stakes, safety-critical domains like drug discovery, finance, and infrastructure management, as mentioned in the motivation. Distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty adds further value for interpretability and decision-making. Success could lead to more trustworthy and robust GNN applications."
