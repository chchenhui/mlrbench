        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of computational efficiency, scalability, resource optimization, efficient data loading/preprocessing, scheduling, and resource allocation. The proposal meticulously elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the DRADP system. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as resource imbalance, dynamic adaptation, adaptive compression, prefetching, and framework integration. The objectives and methodology are directly derived from and consistent with the motivating problem and the identified gaps."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, significance, methodology, and experimental design are articulated concisely and logically. The breakdown of the DRADP system into four distinct modules with specific functions enhances clarity. The RL formulation (MDP, state, action, reward, PPO algorithm) is clearly presented, as are the concepts for adaptive compression and predictive prefetching. The pseudocode provides a helpful overview of the end-to-end process. The experimental plan is detailed and unambiguous. While minor implementation details (e.g., exact mapping of action ratios to resources, specifics of learned codec training) could be further elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. The core novelty lies in the application of reinforcement learning to dynamically schedule fine-grained data preprocessing tasks across heterogeneous resources (CPU/GPU) based on real-time telemetry. While RL and dynamic scheduling exist, their combination for this specific, critical bottleneck in DL training pipelines is innovative. Integrating this with adaptive compression (specifically mentioning *learned* codecs adapting to runtime conditions) and predictive prefetching (using LSTM for batch index prediction) creates a unique, multi-faceted system (DRADP). It clearly distinguishes itself from existing static (PyTorch/TF defaults, DALI) or simple heuristic approaches mentioned as baselines. The literature review provided focuses on RL applications but not directly on this specific scheduling problem, further supporting the novelty claim within that context."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid foundations: MDP for the scheduling problem, PPO as a suitable RL algorithm, standard telemetry collection methods, LSTM for sequence prediction, and established concepts like adaptive compression and prefetching. The technical formulations provided (state vector, reward function, PPO objective, LSTM equations) are appropriate and correctly presented. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant datasets, diverse hardware, strong baselines, comprehensive metrics, ablation studies, and statistical validation. Minor weaknesses include the lack of detail on how the 'learned codecs' are trained and managed, which slightly impacts the rigor of that specific component, and the inherent complexity of tuning the RL system in practice. However, the overall methodological approach is well-justified and robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Collecting telemetry, implementing PPO (using existing libraries), and training an LSTM are standard practices. However, integrating these components into a cohesive system (DRADP) that dynamically controls data loading workers or GPU streams in real-time requires significant systems engineering expertise. The 'learned codecs' aspect could add substantial complexity depending on whether existing ones are adapted or new ones need development. Creating a truly 'plug-and-play' library compatible with major frameworks across diverse user setups is ambitious. While the core ideas are implementable with current technology, the integration, tuning of the RL agent, and ensuring robustness across different environments pose manageable risks and require considerable effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and worsening bottleneck—data preprocessing and I/O—in modern large-scale deep learning. Successfully reducing data loading latency (projected 30-50%) and improving GPU utilization would lead to substantial reductions in training time and computational cost. This has major implications for accelerating research and development, particularly for large models. The goal of democratizing efficient training by improving performance on resource-constrained hardware is highly valuable. Furthermore, the focus on energy efficiency aligns with important Green AI initiatives. The planned open-source library and benchmarks would be a significant contribution to the ML community, potentially impacting a wide range of applications in science, healthcare, and industry."
