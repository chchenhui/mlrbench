        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (WANT workshop). It directly addresses core topics like 'Energy-efficient training', 'Efficient computations: low-precision computations', and the general theme of optimizing training for 'large scale models' to enhance 'computational efficiency' and 'resource optimization'. The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of tackling the energy and resource challenges of training large models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (energy consumption), the core mechanism (dynamic precision scaling based on real-time monitoring of gradients, sensitivity, and power), the control method (rule-based or RL), and the objective (minimize energy under accuracy constraints). The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While static low-precision training is established, the proposed dynamic adaptation based on a combination of real-time gradient statistics, layer sensitivity, *and* hardware power draw is innovative. Using an RL agent as a potential controller adds another layer of novelty. It offers a fresh perspective on optimizing precision beyond static or simpler dynamic schemes, though it builds upon existing concepts in mixed-precision training."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents implementation challenges. Monitoring gradients and power is achievable. Estimating layer sensitivity efficiently requires careful design (lightweight probing is mentioned, acknowledging this). The main challenge lies in efficiently implementing the dynamic precision switching mechanism within existing deep learning frameworks (potential overhead) and ensuring training stability. Developing and tuning the controller (especially RL) also requires significant effort. It's feasible with current technology but requires considerable engineering."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Energy consumption is a critical bottleneck for training large models, impacting cost, accessibility, and the environment. Successfully developing a method to substantially reduce energy use during training without compromising accuracy would be a major advancement. It directly addresses a key pain point in the field and could enable wider adoption and development of large models."
