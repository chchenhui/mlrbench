        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple core topics of the WANT workshop, including 'Training for large scale models', 'Model/tensor/data and other types of parallelisms', 'Communication optimization', 'Energy-efficient training', 'Network-aware resource allocation', 'Architecture-aware resource allocation', and 'Scheduling for AI'. The focus on computational efficiency, scalability, and resource optimization for large models like LLMs/Transformers using a novel parallelism strategy fits perfectly within the workshop's scope and aims."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (limitations of static parallelism), the core concept (Adaptive Dimensional Parallelism - ADP), its key components (runtime profiling, dynamic partitioning via RL, hybrid coordination, hardware-aware rewrites), and expected outcomes/impact are well-defined. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact implementation details of the RL agent or the dynamic kernel fusion mechanism, but the overall research direction is understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While dynamic adjustments in distributed training exist (e.g., dynamic batch sizing, pipeline stage adjustments), the proposed approach of fine-grained, *dynamic dimensional tensor partitioning* (splitting attention heads, MLP dimensions adaptively per layer) driven by runtime profiling and reinforcement learning appears innovative. Combining this with dynamic, hardware-aware kernel fusion adds another layer of novelty compared to static tensor parallelism or coarser dynamic strategies."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating runtime profiling, an RL control system, dynamic tensor decomposition/reshaping (which impacts communication patterns), and on-the-fly hardware-aware kernel modifications within complex distributed training frameworks (like PyTorch FSDP, Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed) is highly complex. The overhead of the profiling and RL decision-making needs to be minimal to avoid negating the performance gains. Ensuring stability and convergence of the RL agent for optimal partitioning strategies is non-trivial. Requires substantial engineering effort and expertise in distributed systems, compilers, and ML/RL."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Training large-scale models efficiently is a critical bottleneck in AI research and deployment. Achieving the expected outcomes (2-5x speedup, 30-50% energy reduction) would represent a major advancement. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of optimizing training to accelerate innovation and democratize access to large-scale AI, potentially enabling smaller teams to train larger models and reducing the environmental footprint of AI."
