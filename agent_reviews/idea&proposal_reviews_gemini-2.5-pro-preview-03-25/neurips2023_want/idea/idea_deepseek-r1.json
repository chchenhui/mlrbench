        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on 'Computational Efficiency, Scalability, and Resource Optimization' in neural network training. The research idea directly targets these aspects by proposing a dynamic system for 'Efficient data loading and preprocessing', leveraging 'Architecture-aware resource allocation' (CPU/GPU based on telemetry) and 'Scheduling for AI' (using an RL agent). It explicitly addresses the bottleneck of data pipelines in large-scale training and aims to democratize efficient training, which resonates strongly with the workshop's motivation and listed topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (dynamic resource-aware preprocessing), key components (RL scheduler, telemetry, adaptive compression, prefetching), and expected outcomes (latency reduction, library) are well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific RL formulation, the exact telemetry signals used, and the implementation details of adaptive compression, but the overall proposal is understandable and precise enough for evaluation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While optimizing data loading pipelines is an existing research area, the proposed approach of using a reinforcement learning agent to dynamically schedule preprocessing tasks across heterogeneous resources (CPU/GPU) based on real-time hardware telemetry is innovative. Combining this dynamic scheduling with adaptive data compression and prioritized prefetching within a unified system offers a fresh perspective compared to static pipelines or simpler optimization techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. Accessing hardware telemetry is possible, and RL for scheduling is a known technique. However, integrating these components into a robust, low-overhead system that works seamlessly with major ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow) requires significant engineering effort. Training the RL agent effectively and ensuring the adaptive compression component is efficient might require careful design and experimentation. The preliminary simulation results add confidence, but real-world deployment across diverse hardware could pose challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Data loading and preprocessing are well-recognized bottlenecks, especially for large datasets and models common in CV and NLP. A system achieving the claimed 30-50% latency reduction would represent a major advancement, significantly speeding up training and reducing computational costs. Furthermore, by aiming to create an open-source, plug-and-play library, the work could democratize efficient large-scale training, directly addressing the workshop's goal of aiding under-resourced teams and accelerating research."
