    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop call for papers). It explicitly adopts the 'bidirectional human-AI alignment' framework central to the workshop, addressing both the 'AI-centered perspective' (aligning AI with humans) and the 'Human-centered perspective' (aligning humans with AI) using the exact terminology and concepts outlined in the task. It directly tackles the workshop's core challenge regarding the inadequacy of unidirectional alignment and aligns with the goals of broadening understanding and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. The proposed topics (RLHF, interaction mechanisms, user studies) fall squarely within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. It clearly states the motivation, the main idea with its two core components, the methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact. The breakdown into AI-centered and Human-centered perspectives provides excellent structure. The specific methods mentioned (RLHF, user-centered design, surveys, prototyping) are concrete and understandable. There are no significant ambiguities, making the proposal easy to grasp."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by proposing a specific framework for 'dynamic human-AI interaction models' focused on 'adaptive alignment' within the bidirectional paradigm highlighted by the workshop. While the individual components (RLHF, user-centered design, feedback loops) are existing concepts, the novelty lies in their synthesis and integration into a cohesive, dynamic framework explicitly designed for bidirectional adaptation. It offers a fresh perspective on operationalizing the workshop's core theme, moving beyond discussing the concept to proposing a concrete research plan to build models based on it."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly practical and implementable. The proposed methodology relies on established research techniques in both Machine Learning (RLHF) and Human-Computer Interaction (surveys, interviews, prototyping, user studies, iterative refinement). These methods are standard practice and achievable with typical research resources (personnel, time, compute). There are no obvious dependencies on unproven technologies or unavailable data. Building and evaluating prototypes within the proposed framework seems entirely feasible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of AI alignment, specifically focusing on the limitations of static, unidirectional approaches. By aiming to develop models for dynamic, adaptive, and bidirectional alignment, it tackles a key challenge for creating AI systems that are safe, trustworthy, and effectively collaborate with humans. Success would contribute directly to more ethical AI development, enhance human agency in interacting with AI, and provide a valuable framework for future research, aligning perfectly with the stated importance in the workshop description."
