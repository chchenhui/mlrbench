    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment by proposing a method for 'Aligning AI with Humans' (customizing AI based on user specifications) and implicitly supporting 'Aligning Humans with AI' (empowering users with control). The motivation explicitly critiques the 'unidirectional' approach mentioned in the task description. Furthermore, 'Customizable Alignment' is listed as a specific topic of interest under the 'Deployment' scope in the Call For Papers, making this idea highly relevant."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the core concept of 'Alignment Profiles' with a three-layer structure (Core Safety, Contextual, Personal) is understandable. The mention of interactive preference elicitation (explicit/implicit) adds detail. However, the exact mechanisms for preference elicitation and evolution, and particularly the specific role and necessity of the blockchain component for 'verification' and 'privacy', could be elaborated further for perfect clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While personalized AI and preference learning are existing fields, framing user customization explicitly as a multi-layered 'alignment' problem with distinct safety, contextual, and personal tiers is a fresh perspective. Proposing an open-source framework to 'democratize' this process adds to the novelty. It combines existing concepts (preference learning, user profiles, safety layers) in a novel configuration tailored to the bidirectional alignment challenge. The blockchain aspect is less novel and its application here needs stronger justification."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Defining and implementing the 'Core Safety Layer' with 'immutable ethical boundaries' that are universally applicable is a major, unresolved challenge in AI ethics and alignment research. While the Contextual and Personal layers are more technically achievable using preference learning techniques, reliably eliciting and integrating both explicit and implicit preferences, especially as they evolve, is complex. The proposed blockchain system adds substantial technical overhead and potential scalability issues, and its benefits over more traditional secure databases are not clearly articulated, potentially representing over-engineering. Significant research and engineering effort would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical limitation of 'one-size-fits-all' AI alignment, which is increasingly problematic as AI becomes pervasive across diverse cultures and contexts. Enabling customization while maintaining safety boundaries could drastically improve user acceptance, trust, and the utility of AI systems. It directly contributes to the 'AI-to-Human' alignment goal and empowers users ('Human-to-AI' alignment). Successfully implementing such a framework could lead to major advancements in personalized AI and provide valuable insights into representing and respecting diverse human values."
