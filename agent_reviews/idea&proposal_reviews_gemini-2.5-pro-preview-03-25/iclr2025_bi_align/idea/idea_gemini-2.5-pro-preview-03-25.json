        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of bidirectional human-AI alignment, emphasizing the inadequacy of static, unidirectional approaches and proposing a dynamic, interactive solution. It tackles both 'Aligning AI with Humans' (steering AI via nuanced feedback) and touches upon 'Aligning Humans with AI' (enhancing user agency and understanding through negotiation). The proposed methods (interactive UI, online RLHF variants) and focus areas (steerability, user control, value negotiation) fit squarely within the workshop's scope, particularly under 'Methods', 'Deployment', and 'Specification'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation highlighting the limitations of static alignment is concise. The core concept of 'Co-Steer' as an interactive system for real-time negotiation is explained effectively. The proposed UI features (sliders, NL critiques, editing) and the underlying mechanism (dynamic updates via online learning) are described concretely, making the proposal easy to understand. The evaluation plan and expected outcomes are also clearly stated, leaving little room for ambiguity about the research direction."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While interactive alignment and online RLHF are emerging areas, the specific proposal of a multi-modal UI focused explicitly on *negotiating* competing values in real-time using mechanisms like sliders, combined with NL critiques and editing, offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond simple preference feedback towards a more nuanced, continuous steering mechanism. The integration of these specific UI elements for dynamic value alignment represents a significant innovative step in interaction design for AI alignment."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Designing and implementing the interactive UI is standard practice. Conducting user studies for evaluation is also well-established. The primary technical challenge lies in the real-time dynamic updating of the AI's alignment model based on continuous, multi-modal feedback. While online RLHF and related techniques are computationally intensive and require careful implementation to ensure stability and responsiveness, they are active areas of research with promising results, making this aspect challenging but achievable within a research context. Access to models amenable to such fine-tuning is also increasingly available."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized limitation of static AI alignment, proposing a solution for dynamic adaptation during human-AI interaction. Enabling users to negotiate and steer AI behavior based on evolving contexts and competing values could lead to major advancements in AI usability, trustworthiness, and safety. Improved user control and agency are crucial for effective human-AI collaboration. Success in this research could provide a valuable paradigm and practical tools for developing more contextually appropriate and aligned AI systems across various domains."
