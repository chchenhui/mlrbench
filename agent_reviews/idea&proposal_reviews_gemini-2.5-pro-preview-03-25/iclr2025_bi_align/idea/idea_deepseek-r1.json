    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme of 'Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment'. It explicitly addresses the limitations of unidirectional alignment (AI adapting to humans, e.g., RLHF) and proposes a framework that incorporates both AI adaptation to humans (dynamic feedback) and human adaptation to AI (explainable guidance). This directly aligns with the workshop's definition involving both 'Aligning AI with Humans' and 'Aligning Humans with AI'. The idea touches upon relevant topics mentioned in the call, such as methods (RLHF, interaction mechanisms), evaluation (metrics for alignment), deployment (interpretability), and societal impact, fitting perfectly within the workshop's scope and goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is clearly articulated and well-defined. The motivation highlights the problem with current approaches, and the main idea presents a coherent solution involving co-adaptation through feedback and explanations. Key components like RLHF, adaptive explanations, user tracking, and dual metrics are mentioned, providing a good understanding of the proposed framework. The integration of NLP, HCI, and ML is explicitly stated. While specific algorithmic details are omitted (as expected in a concise proposal), the overall concept and its components are presented with good clarity and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like RLHF and XAI exist, the core novelty lies in their integration into a *co-adaptive* framework explicitly designed for *bidirectional* alignment. The concept of dynamically tailoring explanations based on tracked user understanding and using this to inform both the explanation strategy and the AI's learning process (potentially influencing RLHF rewards) is innovative. Furthermore, proposing 'human alignment maturity' as a key evaluation metric alongside AI performance offers a fresh perspective compared to traditional AI-centric evaluations. It pushes beyond static alignment towards a dynamic, mutually adaptive human-AI system."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant research and engineering challenges. Implementing RLHF, generating various explanation types (saliency, counterfactuals), and designing user interfaces are achievable with current technologies. However, integrating these into a real-time, dynamically co-adaptive system is complex. Accurately tracking user comprehension and confusion signals in real-time, ensuring explanations effectively guide human adaptation without being overwhelming, and balancing the adaptation rates of both human and AI require careful design and experimentation. Defining and reliably measuring 'human alignment maturity' also poses a challenge. It's ambitious but feasible as a research project with appropriate resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance and impact potential. It addresses a critical limitation in current AI alignment research â€“ the lack of focus on the human side of the adaptation process. By promoting mutual understanding and adaptation, the proposed framework could lead to safer, more effective, and more trustworthy human-AI collaboration, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and education mentioned in the proposal. Successfully developing and validating such a framework would be a major advancement towards achieving robust bidirectional alignment and could significantly influence future research directions in both ML and HCI."
