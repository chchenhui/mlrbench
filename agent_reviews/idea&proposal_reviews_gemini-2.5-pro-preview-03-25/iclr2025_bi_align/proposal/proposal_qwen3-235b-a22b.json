    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of 'bidirectional human-AI alignment' emphasized in the task description, focusing on the dynamic and evolving nature of interactions. The research objectives align perfectly with the research idea's motivation and main concepts (real-time feedback, online RL, interpretability). Furthermore, the methodology and significance sections explicitly reference and build upon the challenges and techniques identified in the literature review (e.g., limitations of static RLHF, RLAIF, KTO, PPO, strategyproofness concerns, interpretability needs, SHARPIE framework)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented logically. The algorithmic design includes specific equations (Hybrid RL-IL loss, PPO loss, IL loss, counterfactual explanation), and the experimental plan details domains, baselines, metrics, and protocol. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for fusing multimodal feedback or the specifics of the Bayesian optimization for the weighting factor alpha, but these do not significantly detract from the overall understanding. The proposal is well-articulated and largely unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like online RL (PPO), imitation learning, multimodal feedback, and counterfactual explanations exist, their specific integration into a unified framework for *real-time, dynamic, bidirectional* human-AI alignment is innovative. The hybrid RL-IL objective tailored for balancing adaptation and stability in this context, combined with real-time generation of counterfactual explanations linked directly to feedback-driven policy updates, represents a fresh approach compared to static RLHF, RLAIF, or standard online RL methods. The emphasis on co-adaptation and longitudinal evaluation further enhances its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established methods like PPO and imitation learning. The hybrid loss function is a plausible approach to address non-stationarity and stability. The proposed counterfactual explanation method is technically reasonable. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse metrics (technical and human-centric), and both simulation and user studies. The proposal acknowledges potential issues like reward hacking (implicitly via PPO and stability metrics) and references relevant literature on strategyproofness and over-optimization. A minor point of concern is the claim of 'theoretical guarantees on convergence under non-stationary feedback' citing a paper on strategyproofness, which might require further clarification or stronger theoretical backing specific to the proposed hybrid method."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The core algorithmic components (PPO, IL, LLM processing) rely on existing technologies. The use of frameworks like SHARPIE could streamline implementation. However, integrating all components into a robust real-time system, especially handling multimodal feedback reliably, is complex. The planned longitudinal user study (100 participants over 4 weeks) is ambitious and requires significant resources for recruitment, management, and data analysis. While technically achievable, the scale and complexity introduce moderate risks regarding execution within typical research constraints."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current AI alignment methods â€“ their inability to handle dynamic, evolving human preferences in real-time. By focusing on bidirectional co-adaptation and integrating interpretability, it directly contributes to the development of more trustworthy, adaptable, and human-centered AI systems. Success would represent a major advancement in human-AI interaction and alignment research, with substantial potential impact in high-stakes domains like healthcare and education, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals and addressing key ethical considerations."
