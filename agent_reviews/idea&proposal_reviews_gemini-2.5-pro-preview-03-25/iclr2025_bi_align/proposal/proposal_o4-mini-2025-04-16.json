    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core concept of 'bidirectional human-AI alignment' emphasized in the task description by proposing mechanisms for both AI adaptation (AI-centered) and human understanding/steering via explanations (human-centered). It tackles the key challenges highlighted, such as dynamic preferences, non-stationarity, and interpretability. The methodology builds logically upon the research idea, elaborating on the hybrid RL-IL approach, multimodal feedback, and explanation generation. Furthermore, it incorporates and cites relevant work from the literature review (e.g., PPO, online RL, RLAIF as a baseline) and positions itself to address the identified gaps, particularly regarding continuous adaptation and interpretable feedback loops in dynamic settings."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a good level of detail on the system architecture, algorithms (PPO, IL), feedback integration, and explanation mechanism, including mathematical formulations and pseudocode. The experimental design is clearly outlined. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement, such as the precise nature of the implicit feedback model and the exact implementation details of the template-based explanation generation, but overall the proposal is well-articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the individual components (Online RL, PPO, IL, multimodal feedback, explanation generation) exist, the novelty lies in their specific synthesis and application to address the problem of real-time, bidirectional human-AI co-adaptation under non-stationary preferences. The proposed hybrid RL-IL architecture tailored for balancing adaptation and retention in this specific context, combined with the integrated multimodal feedback mechanism and the feedback-driven explanation loop, represents a fresh approach compared to static RLHF or simpler online methods discussed in the literature. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work like offline RLHF or RLAIF by focusing on continuous human feedback integration and bidirectional interaction."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in well-established methods like PPO for RL and behavioral cloning for IL. The rationale for combining RL and IL to handle non-stationarity (balancing adaptation and retention) is logical. The feedback integration approach using weighted sums of encoded signals is standard. The technical formulations for the losses and reward shaping appear correct. The experimental design is rigorous, including relevant baselines, appropriate metrics, a within-subject design, and a plan for statistical analysis. Minor weaknesses include the somewhat underspecified implicit feedback model and the potentially simplistic template-based explanation mechanism, but the core methodology is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core components (RL algorithms, NL processing, simulation environments) rely on standard tools. However, integrating these into a cohesive real-time system, developing the hybrid learning loop, and implementing the feedback and explanation modules requires significant engineering effort. Conducting longitudinal human studies with 60 participants per domain is resource-intensive but standard for HCI/ML research. Key risks include ensuring the stability of the online learning process with potentially noisy human feedback and effectively tuning the various hyperparameters (\\lambda, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma). Overall, the plan is realistic but ambitious, requiring careful execution and potentially refinement."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: aligning AI systems dynamically with evolving human preferences and contexts, which is crucial for safety, trust, and effectiveness in real-world applications. By aiming to create a framework for bidirectional co-adaptation, it tackles limitations of static alignment methods. Success would lead to major advancements in personalized AI, collaborative robotics, and other areas requiring continuous human-AI interaction. The focus on both AI adaptation and human empowerment through explanations has substantial potential impact, bridging ML, HCI, and social sciences, and informing responsible AI development."
