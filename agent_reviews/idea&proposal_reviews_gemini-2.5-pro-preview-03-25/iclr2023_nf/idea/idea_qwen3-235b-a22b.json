    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly asks 'What representation can we use for neural fields in order to extract high level information from them and solve downstream tasks? What novel architectures do we need to extract such information from these representations?'. The proposed idea directly addresses this question by suggesting a self-supervised framework using hypernetworks and contrastive learning to extract features from neural fields for downstream tasks. It also aligns with the goal of expanding neural field applications beyond vision by proposing evaluation on diverse modalities like medical images and climate data."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (gap between neural field representation and downstream task utility) is explicitly stated. The proposed method (self-supervised contrastive learning on neural field embeddings generated by a hypernetwork using spatial transformations) is clearly articulated. The objective (learning disentangled, task-agnostic features) and evaluation plan are well-described. Minor details about the specific hypernetwork architecture or loss variants could be added, but the core concept is immediately understandable and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While neural fields and self-supervised learning (SSL) are known concepts, applying SSL, specifically contrastive learning with spatial transformations, directly to features derived *from* a neural field via a hypernetwork to learn task-agnostic representations is innovative. Most work focuses on using SSL to train the neural field itself or applying standard feature extractors post-rendering. This approach explores learning features from the implicit representation structure itself, offering a fresh perspective on leveraging neural fields beyond reconstruction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Neural fields, hypernetworks, and contrastive learning frameworks are well-established. Implementing the proposed architecture and training pipeline is achievable. However, potential challenges exist: training complexity (jointly optimizing or sequentially training the field, hypernetwork, and SSL objective), computational cost (especially with large fields or datasets), and ensuring the effectiveness of spatial transformations as a self-supervision signal across diverse data types represented by neural fields. Moderate refinement and optimization might be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current neural fields â€“ their primary use for representation/reconstruction rather than direct analysis or downstream tasks. If successful, this research could unlock the potential of neural fields for a wide range of applications requiring semantic understanding (e.g., scientific discovery in medical imaging, climate science pattern analysis, anomaly detection in 3D scans). Providing a general method to extract meaningful features directly from neural fields would be a major advancement, significantly broadening their utility and impact across various scientific and engineering disciplines, aligning perfectly with the workshop's cross-disciplinary goals."
