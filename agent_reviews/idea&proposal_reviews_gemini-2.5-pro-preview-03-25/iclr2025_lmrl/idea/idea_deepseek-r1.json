    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the LMRL workshop task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on multiscale representation learning, new evaluation metrics, benchmarks, standardization, and modeling biological perturbations, all of which are central components of this proposal. It directly addresses the workshop's key questions regarding how to evaluate the quality and utility of learned representations, particularly their ability to capture information across different biological scales (molecular, cellular, tissue), which is highlighted as essential for building towards 'virtual cell' models."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (lack of cross-scale evaluation), outlines the main components of the proposed benchmark framework (consistency tasks, latent space analysis, downstream generalization), specifies the types of data and methods involved, and lists expected outcomes. The concept of 'cross-scale consistency' is well-explained through examples (predicting perturbation effects across scales). It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While benchmarking foundation models is an active area, this proposal's specific focus on rigorously evaluating *cross-scale consistency* using integrated datasets and dedicated consistency tasks (like predicting perturbation effects across scales via contrastive learning) is innovative. It moves beyond standard downstream task performance metrics to propose biologically grounded, scale-aware evaluations. The combination of specific evaluation techniques tailored for cross-scale biological hierarchy represents a fresh perspective compared to existing benchmarks."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The proposed evaluation methods (contrastive learning, graph metrics, downstream task evaluation) are established ML techniques. The main challenge lies in obtaining or curating sufficiently large and well-integrated multi-scale datasets (linking e.g., protein structures, single-cell data, and imaging). However, the proposal aims to develop datasets as an outcome, suggesting an awareness of this challenge, and leveraging existing public datasets (like those mentioned in the workshop description) for integration is a viable, though potentially complex, path. Computational requirements are high but standard for foundation model research."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Evaluating and ensuring cross-scale consistency is a critical bottleneck for developing foundation models that can genuinely simulate complex biological systems, such as the 'virtual cell' concept mentioned in the workshop description. A standardized benchmark framework addressing this gap would be a major contribution, guiding model development and enabling more meaningful comparisons. It directly addresses a fundamental challenge in biological representation learning with the potential to accelerate progress significantly."
