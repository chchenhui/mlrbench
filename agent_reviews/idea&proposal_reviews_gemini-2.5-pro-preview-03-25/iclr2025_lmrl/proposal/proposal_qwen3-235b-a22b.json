    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the LMRL workshop's core themes: multimodal/multiscale representation learning, causality, generalization to perturbations, and the development of evaluation metrics towards 'virtual cell' models. It faithfully elaborates on the provided research idea, detailing the Causal Graph-Contrast framework. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the context of the literature review, citing relevant prior work (e.g., MOGCL, HyperGCL, causal representation learning papers) as baselines or related concepts and explicitly tackling the identified challenges like data integration, causality, and generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology follows a logical structure, detailing data integration, pretraining tasks (with mathematical formulations for MNE, XMC, CIM), and a comprehensive experimental design. The rationale and significance are well-explained. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for constructing inter-scale graph links and the exact definition of the 'GNN Loss' within the Causal Intervention Modeling objective. However, these points do not significantly obscure the overall proposal, which is generally easy to understand."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts (graph neural networks, multimodal contrastive learning, causal inference principles, multiscale modeling) into a unified framework specifically tailored for cross-scale biological representation learning. While individual components like GCL or MCL exist (as shown in the literature review), the key novelty lies in the specific combination: using a hierarchical graph structure spanning atomic to cellular scales, and jointly optimizing contrastive alignment with an explicit causal intervention modeling objective (L_{CIM}) designed to predict cellular responses to molecular perturbations. This synthesis, aimed at disentangling causal effects across biological scales, offers a fresh perspective compared to existing methods cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established methods like GNNs (GATs), contrastive learning (InfoNCE), and masked modeling. The proposed methodology, including the hierarchical graph structure and the three pretraining objectives, is technically plausible and well-justified for the stated goals. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant datasets, strong baselines, appropriate metrics (including OOD generalization and causal validity via SHD), and ablation studies. The causal modeling component, while framed using intervention concepts, is implemented pragmatically as a predictive task, which is a sound approach for the goal of predicting effects, although strong claims about identifying deep causal mechanisms would require further justification. The technical formulations are mostly correct, with only minor lack of specificity (e.g., 'GNN Loss')."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. It leverages existing public datasets (ChEMBL, AlphaFoldDB, JUMP-CP, RxRx3, LINCS) and standard ML techniques (GATs, contrastive learning). The specified computational resources (8xA100 GPUs, DDP) are appropriate for the potential scale. However, constructing the complex hierarchical graph, especially integrating diverse data modalities and defining robust inter-scale links and cellular graph representations from imaging, will require significant data engineering effort and potentially domain expertise. Training potentially large GNNs also poses scalability challenges. While achievable within a well-resourced project, these complexities lower the feasibility score slightly from excellent."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical limitations in current biological foundation models: the inability to capture cross-scale causal mechanisms and poor generalization to unseen perturbations. These are major bottlenecks in computational biology, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. By aiming to create representations that link molecular events to cellular phenotypes causally, the work directly contributes to the 'virtual cell' concept mentioned in the LMRL task description. Success would enable more reliable *in silico* simulation, potentially accelerating therapeutic development and providing deeper biological insights. The focus on OOD generalization and causal validity also contributes valuable evaluation perspectives to the field."
