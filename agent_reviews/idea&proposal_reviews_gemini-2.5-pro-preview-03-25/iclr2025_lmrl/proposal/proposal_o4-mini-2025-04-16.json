        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (LMRL workshop themes: multimodal/multiscale learning, causality, generalization, evaluation, virtual cells), the research idea (Causal Graph-Contrast framework), and the literature review (building upon multimodal contrastive learning and causal representation learning while addressing identified challenges). It directly tackles the workshop's key questions by proposing a method for meaningful cross-scale representations that incorporate causality and aim for better generalization, evaluated through specific downstream tasks and OOD scenarios. The methodology clearly elaborates on the core concepts outlined in the research idea and positions the work effectively within the context of the cited literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (data, graph construction, encoders, pretraining tasks, algorithm, experimental design), and expected outcomes are presented logically. Mathematical notations are used, and the overall approach is understandable. However, the precise mechanism and interpretation of the causal loss term (L_{\\\\rm causal}), particularly the minimization of distance between z^{\\\\rm int} and z^{\\\\rm cell} alongside the HSIC penalty, could benefit from slightly more detailed explanation or justification to remove minor ambiguity regarding how it enforces causal disentanglement."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While components like multimodal contrastive learning, graph neural networks, and causal representation learning exist individually (as shown in the literature review), the specific contribution lies in their synergistic integration: a self-supervised framework combining (1) cross-scale (atom-to-cell) multimodal (molecule-cell) graph representation learning, (2) contrastive objectives across these modalities, and (3) explicit causal intervention modeling using perturbation metadata directly within the pretraining loop. This combination, aimed at improving OOD generalization for biological perturbations, represents a fresh perspective distinct from prior work cited, which typically focuses on only one or two of these aspects or applies them in different contexts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous, built upon established methods like GNNs, InfoNCE contrastive loss, and masked modeling. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics, and ablations. The use of HSIC for penalizing non-causal dependencies is appropriate. However, the formulation of the primary term in the causal loss (L_{\\\\rm causal} = \\\\sum \\\\|z_i^{\\\\rm int} - z_i^{\\\\rm cell}\\\\|_2^2) requires further clarification or justification regarding its intended effect (e.g., is z^{\\\\rm int} meant to be intervention-invariant, or represent the causal effect?). While conceptually plausible, this specific part slightly weakens the overall rigor without more detailed theoretical backing or explanation in the proposal. The rest of the methodology is well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages large, publicly available datasets (JUMP-CP, RxRx3, ChEMBL, PDB) and standard machine learning techniques (GNNs, contrastive learning). Implementation is possible with existing libraries. However, pretraining on ~1M complex graph pairs is computationally intensive, requiring significant resources. Integrating the different components (heterogeneous graphs, multiple loss functions including the custom causal loss) presents engineering challenges. Tuning the hyperparameters (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, \\tau) will require careful experimentation. The risks are manageable, but successful execution requires substantial computational resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical challenges in biological AI: integrating multiscale information (molecular to cellular) and learning representations robust to unseen perturbations by incorporating causality. Success would lead to more reliable models for drug activity prediction, phenotype classification, and understanding cellular mechanisms. The aim to contribute towards AI-powered virtual cell simulators positions the work at the forefront of the field. Providing open-source code and benchmarks would further amplify its impact on the AIxBio community."
