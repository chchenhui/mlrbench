        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's theme of modeling interactions between humans, algorithmic decision-making, and society. It directly addresses several key topics listed in the call for papers, including 'Feedback loops between human and algorithmic decisions, and their long-term impacts', 'Strategic behavior', 'Modeling societal outcomes', and 'Fairness and algorithmic approaches to mitigate disparate impact'. The focus on dynamic modeling, long-term effects, and equity fits precisely within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation clearly states the problem of harmful feedback loops. The main idea outlines the proposed approach (dynamic causal modeling, SCMs, RL, equilibrium analysis) and its goals (simulation, mitigation, equity). The expected outcomes are specific (toolkit, training schemes, benchmarks). Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact implementation details of the 'intervention modules' or the specific structure of the SCMs, but the overall concept and research direction are well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While research exists on feedback loops and algorithmic fairness separately, the proposed integration of dynamic causal modeling (specifically SCMs), reinforcement learning, and equilibrium analysis to explicitly model and mitigate *equitable* long-term societal outcomes arising from these loops is innovative. The focus on dynamic causal structures for these complex interactions, combined with intervention design for equity, offers a fresh perspective compared to static fairness analyses or simpler feedback models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building and validating dynamic structural causal models for complex socio-technical systems is inherently difficult, requiring strong assumptions and substantial data, especially longitudinal data which is often scarce. Integrating RL and equilibrium analysis adds further complexity. While validation on synthetic data is achievable, robust real-world validation and deployment of 'intervention modules' would require considerable effort, data access, and methodological refinement. The ambition level makes practical implementation challenging, though the core techniques are established."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical and increasingly urgent problem of unintended negative consequences arising from algorithm-human feedback loops, such as exacerbated inequality and polarization. Developing a framework to understand, predict, and mitigate these dynamics, particularly with a focus on long-term equity, could lead to major advancements in responsible AI development and deployment. The potential outcomes (auditing tools, fairer algorithms) could have substantial positive societal impact."
