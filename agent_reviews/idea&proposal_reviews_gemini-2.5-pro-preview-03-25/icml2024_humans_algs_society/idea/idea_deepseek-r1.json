        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed, including 'Feedback loops between human and algorithmic decisions, and their long-term impacts', 'Models for human utility/preferences in the presence of non-rational behavior' (via bounded rationality and heuristics), 'Modeling societal outcomes through multi-agent models' (using MARL), and 'Fairness and algorithmic approaches to mitigate disparate impact' (through regularization). The focus on modeling bidirectional interactions and mitigating harmful societal outcomes like polarization fits perfectly within the workshop's scope of understanding and shaping the interplay between humans, algorithms, and society."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. It defines the problem (feedback loops), the proposed method (MARL with specific agent types), the mitigation strategy (hybrid optimization), and the validation approach (synthetic/real-world data). The core concepts like MARL, bounded rationality, and regularization are understandable within the ML context. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise mathematical formulation of the bounded rationality model or the specific heuristic rules for user adaptation, but the overall research direction and methodology are clearly presented."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using MARL for agent interactions or studying feedback loops isn't entirely new, the specific combination proposed here is innovative. Modeling *bidirectional* adaptation between users (with bounded rationality/heuristics) and algorithms within a MARL framework specifically to study *long-term societal outcomes* like polarization, coupled with a *hybrid mitigation strategy* (regularizing the algorithm while modeling user adaptation), offers a fresh perspective. It builds upon existing work but combines elements in a way that promises new insights into diagnosing and mitigating these complex feedback dynamics."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Implementing MARL simulations, especially for long-term dynamics and potentially complex agent models, can be computationally intensive. Accurately modeling human bounded rationality and specific heuristics like confirmation bias in a computationally tractable way is non-trivial. Validation on real-world recommendation data might face hurdles related to data access and the complexity of isolating the specific feedback loops. However, the core methodology (MARL, regularization) is established, and validation on synthetic data is certainly achievable. Real-world validation is plausible with appropriate simplifications or specific datasets."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Feedback loops in human-algorithmic systems are a major driver of societal issues like polarization, misinformation, and inequality, making this a critical area of research. Developing frameworks to model, understand, and mitigate these loops could lead to major advancements in designing more ethical and socially responsible AI systems, particularly in areas like recommendation and content moderation. The potential outcomes – diagnostic tools and mitigation strategies – directly address pressing real-world problems."
