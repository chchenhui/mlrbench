    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop task (feedback loops, long-term impacts, strategic behavior, fairness, societal outcomes). It meticulously elaborates on the research idea, detailing the proposed dynamic causal framework, mitigation strategies, and expected outcomes. Furthermore, it explicitly builds upon and synthesizes the concepts presented in the provided literature review (SCMs, RL for fairness, equilibrium analysis, interventions, auditing, benchmarks), positioning itself perfectly within the current research landscape described."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and logically presented. The objectives, methodology (framework, identification, intervention, validation), and expected outcomes are articulated well. Mathematical notations are introduced to define key concepts. However, some technical details, particularly regarding the specific functional forms in the SCM, the precise definition of the counterfactual for feedback strength, the implementation details of causal regularization, and the exact nature of the strategic adaptation space, could benefit from further elaboration for complete clarity. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and understandable, with only minor ambiguities."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality and innovation. While individual components draw from existing literature (SCMs, RL, causal inference, dynamical systems), the novelty lies in the ambitious synthesis and integration of these techniques into a coherent, dynamic causal framework specifically designed to analyze and mitigate long-term fairness issues arising from algorithm-human feedback loops. The development of practical tools like the 'Feedback Audit Toolkit' and 'Intervention Module Library' based on this integrated framework, along with specific intervention mechanisms like causal regularization and temporal equity constraints within this dynamic context, represents a fresh and valuable contribution beyond examining these elements in isolation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon solid theoretical foundations in structural causal modeling, dynamical systems theory, reinforcement learning, and game theory. The proposed methodology, including the SCM formulation, feedback identification techniques (Jacobian analysis), intervention designs, and the multi-stage validation plan, is generally well-justified and appropriate for the problem. Technical formulations are mostly correct and clearly presented, though some aspects (e.g., precise derivative calculations, assumptions for SCMs in social contexts, practical implementation of constraints) would require further detailed justification and careful handling during execution. The reliance on recent, relevant literature supports its soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The integration of multiple complex methodologies (SCMs, dynamical systems, RL, game theory) is technically demanding. While synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments are achievable, the real-world validation stage poses considerable hurdles, requiring extensive longitudinal data, strong partnerships with platform providers willing to run complex, long-term A/B tests, and access to potentially sensitive information. Developing the proposed software tools (audit toolkit, intervention library) is also a substantial undertaking. The overall scope is broad, requiring significant resources, time, and cross-disciplinary expertise, making full execution challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem â€“ the potential for algorithmic systems to exacerbate societal inequities through dynamic feedback loops. This is a central challenge in responsible AI. The potential contributions, including a formal dynamic fairness framework, causal analysis methods, practical auditing/intervention tools, and benchmarks for long-term fairness, could lead to major advancements in both research and industry practice. Successfully mitigating harmful feedback loops would have substantial positive societal impact across various domains (recommendations, credit, hiring)."
