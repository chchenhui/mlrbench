        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes of modeling human-algorithm interactions, feedback loops, long-term impacts, and fairness. The methodology (SCM, RL, interventions) precisely matches the research idea. It explicitly builds upon and cites relevant papers from the literature review (e.g., arXiv:2306.67890, arXiv:2301.12345) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified therein, such as dynamic modeling and long-term fairness. The objectives and expected outcomes are fully consistent with the stated goals and prior work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to methodology and expected outcomes. Key concepts like the SCM structure, C-MDP formulation, and fairness constraints are defined mathematically. The intervention modules are described conceptually. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of the causal debiaser (do-operation specifics) and the equilibrium stabilizer (thresholds, noise injection mechanism), and how the different regularization terms interact within the optimization. However, these are acceptable levels of abstraction for a proposal, and the overall research direction and approach are clearly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing concepts from structural causal models, constrained reinforcement learning, equilibrium analysis, and specific intervention strategies into a unified framework for dynamic fairness in algorithm-human feedback loops. While individual components draw on existing literature (acknowledged by citations), their integration to explicitly model and mitigate long-term inequities arising from recursive interactions appears novel. The combination of causal debiasing, utility regularization, and equilibrium stabilization within a C-MDP framework offers a fresh perspective compared to prior work focusing on subsets of these elements. The development of specific benchmarks and open-source tools for this dynamic causal fairness problem also adds to the novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations in SCMs, RL (C-MDPs), and causal inference. The mathematical formulation of the problem using an SCM and C-MDP with a Lagrangian approach is appropriate and technically correct. The proposed intervention modules are conceptually well-grounded in causal principles and fairness considerations. The methodology is generally well-defined. Potential weaknesses lie in the practical challenges of identifying and estimating the SCM parameters (especially latent states) from real-world data and ensuring the correctness of the assumed causal graph, which are common but significant challenges in applied causal inference. The convergence of the proposed complex primal-dual optimization scheme is assumed but not proven."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The required expertise (causal inference, RL, simulation) and computational resources are standard for ML research. Using synthetic data provides a controlled environment for validation. Adapting existing static datasets (MovieLens, UCI Credit) for dynamic simulation is a practical approach, although modeling realistic dynamics requires care. Key challenges include the complexity of implementing and tuning the constrained RL algorithm, integrating the various modules (SCM simulator, RL agent, interventions), and potentially the difficulty of accurately learning or specifying the SCM for the real-world case studies. The plan is generally realistic, with manageable risks typical of ambitious research projects."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of harmful feedback loops in socio-technical systems, which have profound implications for societal equity, polarization, and fairness. By aiming to provide both theoretical understanding and practical tools (algorithms, benchmarks, auditing protocols) for mitigating these issues dynamically, the research has the potential to make substantial contributions to responsible AI development and deployment. Success would advance the state-of-the-art in dynamic fairness, causal ML, and algorithm auditing, potentially influencing practice and policy in high-stakes domains. The topic is central to the themes of the workshop."
