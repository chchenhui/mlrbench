    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of modeling interactions between humans, algorithms, and society, focusing on feedback loops, long-term impacts, and fairness. It systematically elaborates on the research idea, detailing the proposed dynamic causal framework, integration of SCMs and RL, intervention modules, and validation strategy. Furthermore, it is well-grounded in the provided literature, citing relevant papers for its core components (causal inference, RL, equilibrium analysis, interventions, benchmarks) and explicitly aiming to tackle the challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology is presented in logical phases with clear descriptions of the SCM formulation, RL integration, intervention design, and validation plan. Technical formulations (equations for SCM, RL objective, gradient update) are included and easy to understand in the context of the proposal. The structure is logical, making it easy to follow the proposed research plan. While specific functional forms or equilibrium analysis techniques are not fully detailed, the level of clarity is excellent for a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the individual components (SCMs, RL for fairness, equilibrium analysis) exist in the literature (as evidenced by the review), the novelty lies in their proposed synthesis into a unified 'Dynamic Causal Model' (DCM) framework specifically designed to analyze and mitigate harmful feedback loops for long-term societal equity. This integration, focusing on the dynamic interplay and causal pathways over time, offers a fresh perspective compared to static or short-term approaches. The emphasis on bridging causal inference, RL, and equilibrium analysis for this specific problem is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in causal inference (SCMs) and reinforcement learning, referencing established methods and relevant recent literature. The proposed methodology, including the SCM structure, RL objective with fairness regularization, and gradient-based intervention, is conceptually robust and well-justified. The technical formulations provided are clear and appear correct for a proposal-level description. While practical implementation will involve assumptions (e.g., about modeling human behavior and societal dynamics) and require further technical specification, the overall approach is theoretically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating SCMs, multi-agent RL, and equilibrium analysis is technically complex. Accurately modeling complex human strategic behavior and societal dynamics (g_\\\\phi, h) is inherently difficult. The data requirements for robust real-world validation (longitudinal data on algorithms, behavior, and societal outcomes with sufficient granularity) are demanding and may be hard to meet. While validation on synthetic data is achievable, extending it convincingly to real-world systems poses considerable risks and may require strong assumptions or simplifications. The project's ambition requires substantial expertise and computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the potential for algorithmic feedback loops to amplify societal harms like polarization and discrimination. By focusing on dynamic interactions and long-term equity using a causal lens, it tackles a major gap in current research, moving beyond static fairness metrics. The potential contributions – a unified modeling framework, practical auditing tools, policy-aware training methods, and benchmarks – could lead to major advancements in responsible AI development and provide actionable insights for practitioners and policymakers concerned with the societal impact of AI."
