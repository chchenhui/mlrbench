    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the task (role and limitations of synthetic data, new algorithms, evaluation, mixing data, privacy/fairness) by proposing a specific method ('Active Synthesis') outlined in the research idea. The methodology builds logically upon the concepts presented in the literature review (uncertainty guidance, active learning integration, generative models) and explicitly acknowledges the challenges identified therein (quality, overfitting, ethics). The proposal's focus on targeted synthesis guided by model weaknesses fits perfectly within the scope of exploring strategic uses of synthetic data beyond bulk generation."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides significant detail on data, uncertainty estimation (including formulas), specific generative models for different modalities, the active synthesis loop, evaluation metrics, experimental design (baselines, ablations), and ethical considerations. The language is precise and technical, suitable for the target audience. While minor details like the exact conditioning mechanism for diffusion models could be slightly expanded, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, primarily in its synthesis of existing concepts into a unified, systematic framework ('Active Synthesis') applied across multiple data modalities (vision, NLP, tabular) using modern generative models (SD, LLaMA, CTGAN). While the core idea of uncertainty-guided synthetic data generation is present in the cited literature (e.g., papers [2, 4, 5, 7, 9]), and paper [6] even uses the term 'Active Synthesis', this proposal distinguishes itself through its specific, comprehensive implementation plan, the integration of active learning principles in a closed loop, and the breadth of its planned evaluation. The novelty lies more in the specific architecture, cross-modal application, and rigorous evaluation plan rather than a completely groundbreaking core concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations (active learning, Bayesian uncertainty, generative modeling) and employs well-established methods (MC Dropout, Ensembles, SD, LLaMA, CTGAN, standard evaluation metrics). The methodology is robust, detailed, and well-justified. Technical formulations for uncertainty estimation are correct and clearly presented. The proposed active synthesis loop is logical. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, covering performance, generalization, synthetic quality, and efficiency. Mitigation strategies for potential issues like overfitting and bias are included. The only minor point is the lack of explicit definition for the KL regularization term mentioned in the retraining loss, but this doesn't significantly detract from the overall soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges and resource requirements. Implementing and fine-tuning large generative models (SD, LLaMA) conditioned on uncertainty metrics across multiple domains, integrated within an active learning loop, requires substantial expertise and computational resources (acknowledged by mentioning A100/H100 GPU hours). However, the plan uses standard datasets and established techniques, making it achievable within a well-equipped research environment. The step-by-step methodology and clear experimental design suggest a realistic plan, although the ambitious scope might require careful project management. Risks related to implementation complexity and achieving high-quality conditional generation exist but seem manageable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of data access limitations in ML and the inefficiency of current synthetic data approaches. By proposing a method to generate targeted synthetic data based on model weaknesses, it has the potential to significantly improve data efficiency, model robustness, and generalization, particularly in data-scarce or sensitive domains like healthcare. The integration of privacy-preserving techniques (DP) and fairness considerations further enhances its significance. If successful, the 'Active Synthesis' framework could offer a new paradigm for leveraging synthetic data strategically, making substantial contributions to both practical applications and theoretical understanding of data generation in ML."
