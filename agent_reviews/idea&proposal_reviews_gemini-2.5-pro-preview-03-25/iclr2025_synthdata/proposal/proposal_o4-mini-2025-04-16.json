    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core theme of using synthetic data to solve data access problems, focusing on algorithms, evaluation, mixing data, privacy, fairness, and proposing a new paradigm ('Active Synthesis'). The methodology clearly implements the research idea of using uncertainty to guide targeted generation in an active loop. It explicitly references and aims to fill gaps identified in the literature review (or similar works), such as the need for unified frameworks combining uncertainty, conditional generation, and iterative retraining, and evaluation on real-world tasks beyond toy datasets. All sections consistently build towards the central theme."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and easy to understand. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step description of the 'Active Synthesis Loop,' including notation, specific techniques for uncertainty estimation (ensemble variance, entropy), prompt construction examples, generation, filtering, and retraining. The experimental design is thorough, outlining datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The language is precise, and the structure is logical, making the proposal easy to follow and comprehend with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good originality. While the components (active learning, uncertainty estimation, conditional generative models) exist individually, the proposed 'Active Synthesis Loop' integrates them into a specific, unified framework aimed at targeted data generation guided by model weaknesses. The literature review acknowledges related work but highlights the gap this proposal aims to fill: an end-to-end iterative loop using precise uncertainty for conditional generation evaluated at scale. The novelty lies in this specific combination and the focus on actively synthesizing data to fill *identified* knowledge gaps, rather than just augmenting under-represented classes or using uncertainty solely for selecting real data."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established concepts like ensemble uncertainty, predictive entropy, conditional generation (LLMs, diffusion models), and iterative training. The proposed methodology is logical and technically coherent. The experimental design is comprehensive and rigorous, including multiple datasets (CV, NLP, real-world), strong baselines, relevant metrics (covering performance, robustness, fairness, privacy, efficiency), ablation studies, and considerations for statistical significance. Minor uncertainties exist regarding the practical effectiveness of translating uncertainty into optimal generative prompts/conditions and the complexity of the filtering step, but the overall approach is well-justified and technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. It requires significant computational resources (GPUs for training ensembles and large generative models), access to potentially restricted datasets (medical, clinical), and considerable engineering effort to integrate the different components (uncertainty estimation, generative model APIs, retraining loop, filtering). Expertise in both discriminative and generative modeling is needed. While the core technologies exist, successfully implementing and tuning the entire loop, especially the uncertainty-to-conditioning step and the filtering mechanism, requires careful execution. The scope is ambitious, suggesting it's suitable for a well-resourced project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of data access limitations in machine learning, a central theme of the task description. By proposing a method to generate targeted synthetic data efficiently, it has the potential to reduce reliance on large, expensive, or sensitive real datasets. Success could lead to improvements in model robustness, fairness (by addressing underperforming subgroups), and privacy preservation. The 'Active Synthesis' concept could represent a valuable new paradigm for data generation and model training, applicable across various important domains like healthcare, vision, and NLP."
