    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core question of the task regarding synthetic data for data access, covering topics like new algorithms (Active Synthesis), applications (healthcare, privacy-sensitive domains), mixing synthetic/real data, evaluation, and addressing privacy concerns. It perfectly embodies the research idea of using uncertainty to guide synthesis. It also situates itself well within the context provided by the literature review, referencing relevant concepts like uncertainty-guided generation and active learning integration."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology (with stages and a diagram), experimental design, and expected outcomes. Key concepts like 'Active Synthesis', uncertainty metrics, and the iterative process are explained clearly. The objectives are specific and measurable. The language is precise and technical details (like the formulas) are presented correctly, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While the idea of combining uncertainty estimation with synthetic data generation is relevant and timely, the provided literature review includes several 2023 papers exploring very similar concepts (e.g., [2], [5], [7], [9]). Critically, paper [6] is titled 'Active Synthesis: Bridging Active Learning and Data Augmentation', suggesting the core concept and even the name might not be original to this proposal. The proposal doesn't sufficiently articulate its unique contribution or differentiation from this existing work. The novelty seems to lie more in the specific implementation framework rather than a groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations in uncertainty quantification (ensemble variance, entropy), active learning principles, and generative modeling. The proposed methodology (iterative loop, uncertainty metrics, retraining strategy) is logical and technically plausible. The experimental design is comprehensive and robust, including relevant datasets, strong baselines, and appropriate metrics. The technical formulation for the generator loss (\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_G) is conceptually sound but its practical optimization might require further elaboration, representing a minor gap."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The required technologies (ensemble methods, generative models like Stable Diffusion/GPT-4) are available. However, the project demands significant computational resources for training ensembles, generating data, and retraining models iteratively. Accessing specific datasets like MIMIC-III requires approvals. Optimizing the generator guidance mechanism could be complex. While achievable with adequate resources and expertise, the computational cost and potential implementation hurdles make it moderately challenging."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical problem of data scarcity and the limitations of generic synthetic data, directly relevant to the task's theme. If successful, the 'Active Synthesis' framework could lead to major advancements in data efficiency for ML model training, improve model robustness by targeting weaknesses, and mitigate privacy risks by reducing reliance on sensitive real data. Its potential impact spans theoretical contributions (unifying active learning and generation) and practical applications in data-constrained fields."
