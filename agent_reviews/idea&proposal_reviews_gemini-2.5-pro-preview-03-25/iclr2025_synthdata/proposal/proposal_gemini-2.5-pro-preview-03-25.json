    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central question about synthetic data solving the data access problem, incorporating themes like algorithms, evaluation, mixing data, and new paradigms. The methodology systematically implements the 'Active Synthesis' idea, leveraging uncertainty from real data to guide generation. It explicitly references the workshop context and positions itself relative to the provided literature (citing specific papers like Nguyen & Roberts, Smith & Johnson, etc.), showing a clear understanding of the background and prior work."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to specific objectives, detailed methodology, and expected outcomes. Key concepts like 'Active Synthesis', uncertainty estimation methods, and the iterative loop are explained precisely. The experimental design, baselines, and evaluation metrics are clearly articulated, leaving little room for ambiguity. The language is concise and academic. Minor details about specific conditioning mechanisms or mixing strategies are presented as areas for exploration, which is appropriate for a proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal's novelty is limited, primarily due to the provided literature review, which contains numerous highly relevant 2023 papers exploring the core idea of uncertainty-guided synthetic data generation for active learning or robustness. Specifically, paper #6 (Nguyen & Roberts) uses the exact term 'Active Synthesis', and several others (e.g., #2, #5, #7, #9, #10) describe very similar concepts. While the proposal claims novelty in the 'closed-loop integration' and 'efficiency focus', these aspects appear inherent to the ideas presented in the recent literature rather than being fundamentally new contributions. The proposal represents a timely and systematic investigation of an emerging area but doesn't introduce a groundbreaking concept distinct from the very recent prior work provided."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations in active learning, uncertainty quantification (Ensembles, MC Dropout), and generative modeling (Diffusion Models, LLMs). The proposed methodology, including the iterative loop, data handling, algorithmic choices, experimental design (with baselines and ablations), and evaluation metrics, is robust and well-justified. The technical descriptions are clear and appropriate. It acknowledges potential challenges like synthetic data quality and computational cost, demonstrating a realistic understanding of the technical landscape."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents notable challenges. It relies on existing SOTA models and techniques, which are accessible. Using benchmark datasets and simulating scarcity is standard practice. However, the integration of uncertainty estimation, conditional generation (especially the complex conditioning step), and iterative retraining is technically complex and computationally intensive. Significant engineering effort and computational resources (GPU time) will be required, particularly for large generative models and ensemble methods. Tuning the numerous hyperparameters of the loop will also be demanding. While achievable for a well-resourced research group, it's not straightforward."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: overcoming data access limitations in ML using synthetic data, which is central to the workshop theme. It tackles the inefficiency of generic synthetic data by proposing a targeted approach. If successful, Active Synthesis could provide a more data-efficient pathway to train robust models, particularly impactful in data-scarce or sensitive domains (healthcare, finance). It directly contributes to the understanding of synthetic data's role, limitations, and potential, offering a nuanced perspective on the workshop's core question. The potential for improving model reliability and guiding future research is substantial."
