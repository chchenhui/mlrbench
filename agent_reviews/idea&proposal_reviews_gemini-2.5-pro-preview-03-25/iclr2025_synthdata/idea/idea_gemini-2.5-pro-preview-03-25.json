    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed, including 'New algorithms for synthetic data generation' (the active synthesis loop), 'Synthetic data for model training and evaluation', 'Conditional synthetic data generation' (guided by uncertainty), 'Fine-grained control of synthetic data generation' (targeting weaknesses), and 'Mixing synthetic and natural data'. It explores an opportunity for synthetic data to improve model training efficiency, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's theme of discussing the limitations and opportunities of synthetic data in addressing data access problems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation is explicitly stated, contrasting targeted synthesis with generic synthetic data. The main idea outlines a specific, step-by-step process (train, identify uncertainty, prompt generator, synthesize, retrain). Key components like uncertainty estimation methods (ensemble variance, Bayesian) and generator types (LLMs, diffusion models) are mentioned. The concept of 'active synthesis' is intuitive and immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While active learning and synthetic data generation exist independently, the proposed combination – using model uncertainty identified via an active learning-like process to *guide* the *generation* of new synthetic data – is innovative. It moves beyond simply generating data matching a distribution or random augmentation, proposing a targeted approach based on model-specific weaknesses. This 'active synthesis' loop offers a fresh perspective on optimizing the use of synthetic data."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology. Training models, estimating uncertainty (using established methods like ensembles or MC dropout), and using conditional generative models are all achievable. The primary challenge lies in effectively translating identified model uncertainty into specific, actionable prompts for the generative model to synthesize the *right* kind of data to address that uncertainty. This mapping requires careful design and experimentation but seems plausible, making the overall idea feasible, albeit with moderate implementation complexity."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. If successful, it could lead to more data-efficient training protocols, allowing models to achieve higher performance or robustness with less reliance on large amounts of potentially sensitive real data or computationally expensive generic synthetic data. By focusing generation efforts on specific model weaknesses or edge cases, it addresses a key limitation of current synthetic data approaches and could lead to meaningful contributions in fields where targeted robustness is crucial (e.g., autonomous systems, healthcare)."
