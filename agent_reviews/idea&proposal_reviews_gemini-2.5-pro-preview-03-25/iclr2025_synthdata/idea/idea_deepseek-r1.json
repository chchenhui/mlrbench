        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (workshop call for papers). It directly addresses several key topics of interest, including: 'New applications of using synthetic data (e.g., in education)', 'Synthetic data for model training and evaluation', 'Synthetic data for improving specific model capabilities (e.g., reasoning, math)', 'Evaluation of synthetic data quality and models trained on synthetic data', 'Fine-grained control of synthetic data generation', and implicitly touches upon 'Synthetic data to address privacy, fairness, safety and other data concerns' by aiming to reduce reliance on sensitive real-world datasets. The core theme of using synthetic data to overcome data access limitations for improving LLM math reasoning fits perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation (data scarcity for LLM math reasoning), the main proposal (teacher-verifier-student framework for guided synthetic data generation), and the expected outcomes are easy to understand. The core components like guided generation, verification, and iterative training are defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details of the guidance mechanism, the verification module's complexity (symbolic solvers + diversity metrics), and the exact nature of the iterative feedback loop, but the overall concept is precise enough for evaluation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using synthetic data for LLM training, including for math/reasoning tasks, is an active research area, this proposal combines several elements in a structured way. The specific framework involving a 'teacher' LLM for generation, guided by explicit constraints (difficulty, type, pedagogy), a dedicated 'verification' module using both symbolic methods and diversity metrics, and an iterative refinement loop based on 'student' model performance offers a fresh perspective. It builds upon existing concepts but integrates them into a potentially more effective system for targeted capability enhancement, moving beyond simple data augmentation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current resources and technology. It leverages existing LLMs (accessible via APIs or open-source models) for the teacher and student roles. Implementing guided generation through prompting or fine-tuning is standard practice. While integrating symbolic solvers into the verification module requires specific expertise and engineering effort, it is technically achievable. Training LLMs and evaluating them on standard benchmarks like MATH and GSM8K are common procedures. The iterative loop adds complexity but is conceptually sound. Overall, the project is ambitious but practical to implement for a well-equipped research team."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Improving mathematical reasoning is a major frontier for LLMs, and addressing the bottleneck of high-quality training data is crucial. Success could lead to more capable AI systems for education, scientific discovery, and complex problem-solving. By focusing on synthetic data, it also contributes to mitigating reliance on potentially restricted or biased real-world datasets. The proposed methodology, if effective, could be generalized to other reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., coding, logic), broadening its impact. The potential to democratize access to high-quality training data is also a significant contribution."
