        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description for the R2-FM workshop. It directly addresses fundamental questions outlined, such as identifying unreliable behaviors (spurious features, hallucinations), understanding their causes (learned weights/features), and proposing interventions (fine-tuning) to enhance reliability and responsibility. The focus on spurious correlations, factuality, and fairness fits squarely within the workshop's core themes and listed topics like 'Empirical investigations', 'Interventions in fine-tuning', and 'Issues of reliability and responsibility'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is compelling, and the proposed two-stage pipeline (causal attribution via interventions, followed by intervention-guided pruning/reweighting) provides a good conceptual framework. The use of 'do-calculations' and contrastive training is mentioned. However, specifics regarding the exact nature and scale of interventions ('individual hidden activations'), the precise method for quantifying causal effect, and the exact mechanism for pruning/reweighting could be more detailed for full clarity, but the overall concept is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While causal analysis and interventions in neural networks exist, applying targeted interventions ('do-calculations' on activations) specifically to identify spurious features in large foundation models and then using these causal insights to guide pruning/reweighting via contrastive fine-tuning represents a novel approach. It moves beyond correlational methods or simple magnitude pruning, offering a potentially more principled way to remove harmful features based on their causal impact on model behavior."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning the scalability of the causal attribution stage. Systematically intervening on 'individual hidden activations' across 'diverse inputs' for massive foundation models could be computationally prohibitive. The feasibility heavily depends on the granularity of 'features' (neurons, heads, layers?) and the efficiency of the intervention and measurement process. While fine-tuning (Stage 2) is standard, the practicality of Stage 1 at the scale of modern FMs requires further justification or approximation techniques not detailed here. The claimed results suggest some implementation, but the description raises scalability questions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing spurious correlations, hallucinations, bias, and poor generalization in foundation models is a critical challenge for reliable and responsible AI. A successful method for causally identifying and removing such features would represent a major advancement, enhancing model trustworthiness, fairness, and alignment with human values. The potential to reduce hallucinations by ~20% and improve fairness, as claimed, underscores the high potential impact on the field and practical applications."
