    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on reliable and responsible foundation models by proposing interventions during pre-training to mitigate unreliable behaviors like susceptibility to spurious features and bias amplification. This aligns perfectly with the listed topic 'Interventions during pre-training to enhance the reliability and responsibility of FMs' and tackles fundamental questions about understanding and preventing sources of FM unreliability rooted in training data and objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem of spurious correlations and their consequences. The main idea is well-defined, proposing the integration of causal inference into pre-training. The proposed methodology is broken down into three specific, understandable steps (counterfactual augmentation, modified objectives, bias-detection module). The evaluation plan and expected outcomes are also clearly stated, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While causal inference and methods to combat spurious correlations exist in ML, applying them systematically and deeply within the *pre-training* phase of large foundation models is innovative. Most current approaches focus on fine-tuning or post-hoc alignment. The specific combination of counterfactual data augmentation tailored for pre-training, causal-aware objective modification (potentially via adversarial learning), and a dynamic bias-detection module integrated into the pre-training loop offers a fresh perspective on building inherently more reliable FMs from the ground up."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating causal interventions into large-scale pre-training is computationally demanding. Generating meaningful counterfactual data augmentations at the scale required for FMs is non-trivial and potentially expensive. Modifying training objectives with adversarial components or complex regularization adds complexity and cost to an already resource-intensive process. The 'dynamic bias-detection module' also requires careful design and integration. While the individual components are based on known techniques, their combined application in FM pre-training requires substantial engineering effort, computational resources, and potentially further research to scale effectively."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Addressing spurious correlations and biases at the pre-training stage, rather than relying solely on post-hoc fixes, could lead to fundamentally more reliable, robust, and fair foundation models. Success in this area could yield systemic improvements in generalization, reduce harmful biases, enhance factual consistency, and increase trustworthiness for critical applications. Establishing a framework for 'causally aware pre-training' would represent a major advancement in developing responsible AI."
