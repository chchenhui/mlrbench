    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Interventions during pre-training to enhance the reliability and responsibility of FMs' and 'pinpoint and understand the causes behind known or emerging sources of FM unreliability', particularly mentioning training data. The idea directly addresses this by proposing a method to analyze pre-training data causally to mitigate unreliability (like hallucinations) proactively, aligning perfectly with the workshop's scope and key questions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (proactive vs. reactive) and the core steps (segment data, use probes/attribution, causal analysis, map creation, data curation) are understandable. However, some technical details lack precision. Specifically, how 'attribution techniques scaled to large models' would work in this context and the exact methods for performing 'causal analysis' (beyond correlation) between data segments and downstream failures need further elaboration for complete clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While analyzing pre-training data, using probe models, and applying attribution methods are existing techniques, the proposed synthesis is innovative. The core novelty lies in the specific focus on establishing *causal* links between pre-training data characteristics and downstream reliability issues, and using this causal understanding to *proactively* shape the pre-training dataset *before* full model training. This proactive, causal-driven approach to data curation for reliability offers a fresh perspective compared to standard data filtering or reactive fine-tuning."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Segmenting data and training smaller 'probe' models are achievable. However, scaling attribution techniques effectively to trace effects back to specific pre-training data segments in massive datasets and models is computationally demanding and technically complex. Furthermore, performing rigorous causal inference (as opposed to identifying correlations) in such a high-dimensional setting is notoriously difficult and may require strong assumptions or methodological breakthroughs. The resource requirements for experiments (multiple probe models or large-scale attribution) are substantial."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Foundation model reliability is a critical challenge, and pre-training data is a known root cause of many issues like bias and hallucination. Developing methods to proactively identify and mitigate these risks *before* the costly pre-training phase would be a major advancement. A causal understanding of data-induced failures would enable more targeted and effective interventions than current approaches, potentially leading to fundamentally more trustworthy and reliable FMs."
