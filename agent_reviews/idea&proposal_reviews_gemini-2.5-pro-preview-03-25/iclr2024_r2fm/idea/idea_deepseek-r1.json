        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on FM reliability, specifically tackling 'nonfactuality or \"hallucinations\"'. Furthermore, it explicitly proposes 'leveraging domain-specific knowledge to guide FMs towards improved reliability' in areas like drug discovery, which is listed as a key question and topic of interest ('Innovations in fine-tuning processes', 'Issues of reliability and responsibility of FMs in broad applications'). The motivation aligns precisely with the workshop's goal of ensuring trustworthy FMs in critical domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main idea (domain-guided fine-tuning framework), methodology components (knowledge integration, validation loops, adaptive regularization), and expected outcomes (reduced hallucinations, improved domain alignment) are articulated concisely and logically. The inclusion of a specific example (drug discovery) enhances understanding. While the exact technical implementation details of 'differentiable constraints' or 'knowledge-aware loss functions' could be further specified, the current level of detail is excellent for a research idea summary, leaving no major ambiguities about the core proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While fine-tuning FMs and incorporating domain knowledge are established concepts, the proposed approach of embedding domain rules *directly* as differentiable constraints or attention biases within the fine-tuning optimization process, specifically targeting factuality and hallucination reduction in FMs, offers a novel perspective. The combination of constrained optimization, knowledge-aware losses, iterative validation against domain databases, and adaptive regularization into a cohesive framework for this specific purpose represents a fresh approach compared to standard fine-tuning or post-hoc filtering methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Fine-tuning FMs requires significant compute resources, which is standard. Accessing and formalizing domain knowledge (databases, rules) is crucial and may require substantial effort depending on the domain. The core technical challenge lies in encoding potentially complex domain rules into differentiable constraints or effective attention biases; this might require approximations or sophisticated techniques. The validation loops are feasible but could be computationally intensive. Overall, implementation is plausible with current ML techniques but requires careful design and potentially significant engineering effort, particularly for the constraint encoding."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing factual inaccuracies and hallucinations in FMs is a critical challenge, especially for their deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and scientific discovery where reliability is paramount. Success in this research could lead to substantially safer and more trustworthy AI systems, facilitating their adoption in critical applications. It directly tackles a major bottleneck limiting the real-world utility of FMs and contributes to the broader goal of responsible AI development."
