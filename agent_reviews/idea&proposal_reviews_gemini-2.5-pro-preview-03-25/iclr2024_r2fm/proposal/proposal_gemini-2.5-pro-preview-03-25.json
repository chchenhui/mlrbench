    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the R2-FM workshop, such as identifying unreliable behaviors (spurious correlations, hallucinations), understanding their causes within the model, and proposing interventions during fine-tuning to enhance reliability and responsibility. The proposed ICP method is a direct elaboration of the research idea, detailing the two-stage process of causal attribution via interventions and guided pruning/regularization. It effectively positions itself against the cited literature, acknowledging existing approaches (CCR, SEraser, Wang et al.) and challenges (feature identification, intervention design, scalability) while proposing a distinct, activation-level intervention strategy."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Key concepts like 'feature', 'intervention set', 'causal effect', and 'spuriousness score' are explicitly defined. The two stages of the ICP framework are explained with sufficient detail, including mathematical formulations for causal effect and spuriousness score, and descriptions of the pruning and regularization techniques. The experimental design, including baselines, evaluation tasks, and metrics, is comprehensive and easy to understand. The objectives are specific and measurable. There are minor areas where more detail could be added (e.g., specifics of intervention implementation across layers, definition of weighting function w(x,I)), but overall, the proposal is exceptionally clear and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. The core novelty lies in applying targeted causal interventions directly to the *internal hidden activations* of large foundation models to quantify the 'spuriousness' of specific features (neurons, attention components) and then using this causal attribution to guide *targeted model modification* (pruning or regularization). This contrasts with methods focusing on input-level counterfactuals (like CCR), test-time prompt tuning (like SEraser), or regularization based on *manually* identified features (like Wang et al.). While causal inference and model pruning/regularization are established fields, their combination in this specific manner – using activation-level interventions for automated spurious feature identification and mitigation in FMs – represents a fresh and promising approach. The proposal clearly articulates this distinction from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in causal inference principles (interventions) and standard machine learning techniques (pruning, regularization, contrastive learning). The methodology for causal attribution via interventions on activations and calculating a spuriousness score is logically constructed. The proposed mitigation strategies (direct pruning, causal invariance regularization) are technically sound and directly linked to the attribution stage. The mathematical formulations are appropriate. The proposal implicitly acknowledges potential challenges like feature entanglement and the difficulty of perfectly isolating causal effects with atomic interventions, which is realistic. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and ablation studies, indicating methodological rigor. Minor gaps exist, such as the precise handling of complex interactions between features during intervention, but the overall approach is well-justified and theoretically solid."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning computational cost and complexity. Stage 1 (Causal Attribution) requires numerous forward passes with interventions for potentially many features across a probing dataset, which could be extremely computationally expensive for large FMs. Implementing interventions precisely within complex architectures like Transformers requires careful engineering (e.g., using hooks). Designing a comprehensive probing dataset (D_{probe}) that effectively triggers diverse spurious correlations is non-trivial. While the proposal acknowledges scalability issues and suggests mitigation strategies (sampling features, focusing on specific layers), the practicality of executing Stage 1 at scale remains a concern. Stage 2 (Pruning/Regularization) is more standard but depends heavily on the quality of the results from Stage 1. Significant computational resources and specialized expertise are required. The risks associated with scalability and the effectiveness of interventions are substantial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It directly addresses critical issues of reliability (hallucinations, OOD robustness) and responsibility (fairness, bias) in foundation models, which are central concerns for the AI community and the R2-FM workshop. Mitigating spurious correlations is fundamental to building trustworthy AI. If successful, the proposed ICP framework could offer a principled, automated method to enhance FM safety and alignment, potentially leading to more dependable deployment in high-stakes domains. The research could yield valuable insights into how FMs internalize spurious patterns and provide practical tools for developers. It pushes the boundaries of applying causal inference to understand and improve large neural networks, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals."
