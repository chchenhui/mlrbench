        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the R2-FM workshop task, such as identifying unreliable behaviors (spurious features, hallucinations), understanding their causes, and proposing interventions (fine-tuning/pruning) to enhance reliability and responsibility. The methodology closely follows the outlined research idea, detailing the two-stage process of causal attribution via interventions and guided pruning/reweighting. Furthermore, it acknowledges and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself within the context of existing work on causal methods for spurious correlations while highlighting its specific contributions and addressing key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the research objectives. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the Intervention-Based Causal Pruning (ICP) framework, including specific intervention types, mathematical formulations for causal effect and spuriousness score, and the pruning/fine-tuning mechanisms. The experimental design is comprehensive and logically structured, outlining specific tasks, datasets, models, metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. Expected outcomes are quantified, and potential limitations are discussed transparently. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While causal inference and model pruning are established fields, the specific application of systematic interventions (masking, scaling, swapping) directly on the internal activations of large foundation models for causal attribution, followed by targeted structural pruning and intervention-guided contrastive fine-tuning, represents a novel combination of techniques. It distinguishes itself from prior work (cited in the literature review) which might focus on test-time adaptation, regularization based on manual feature identification, or interventions in different contexts (like RL). The proposed model-agnostic, post-hoc approach to causally identifying and mitigating spurious features within FMs offers a fresh perspective."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, grounded in established principles of causal inference (Pearl's do-calculus) and deep learning techniques (pruning, contrastive learning). The methodology for causal attribution through interventions is logical, although the practical implementation and justification for weighting factors (w_I, w_m) might require further refinement. The pruning and contrastive fine-tuning steps are standard techniques applied in a novel context. The experimental design is rigorous, including multiple relevant tasks, strong baselines, comprehensive metrics, and ablation studies. A potential weakness lies in the reliance on an 'approximate inverse' model (M^{-1}) for generating counterfactuals, the feasibility and accuracy of which could impact the contrastive fine-tuning step. Overall, the technical foundations are solid."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal faces significant feasibility challenges, primarily concerning computational cost. Performing systematic interventions (masking, scaling, swapping) on potentially millions or billions of activations across multiple layers for numerous inputs, intervention types, and metrics would require immense computational resources, likely exceeding practical limits for large FMs. While the proposal acknowledges this and suggests sampling/sparsity, the effectiveness of these mitigations without compromising the integrity of the causal attribution is uncertain. Additionally, implementing the approximate inverse model (M^{-1}) for contrastive fine-tuning presents a non-trivial technical challenge. The ambitious scope across multiple models and tasks further strains feasibility within a typical project timeframe."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: enhancing the reliability and responsibility of foundation models. Mitigating issues like hallucinations, bias, and poor generalization caused by spurious correlations is critical for the safe and effective deployment of FMs in real-world applications, especially high-stakes domains. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in AI safety, alignment, and trustworthiness. The proposed causal approach offers potential for deeper interpretability and more robust solutions compared to purely correlational methods. The potential impact on model evaluation standards and responsible AI practices is substantial."
