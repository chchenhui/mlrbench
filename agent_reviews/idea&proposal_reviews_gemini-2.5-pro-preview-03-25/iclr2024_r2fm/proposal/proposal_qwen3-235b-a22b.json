        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the R2-FM workshop's core themes by focusing on identifying and mitigating unreliable FM behaviors like spurious correlations and hallucinations through causal interventions. The methodology clearly operationalizes the research idea's two-stage pipeline (attribution via intervention, pruning/reweighting). Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to build upon the cited literature (CCR, SEraser) while acknowledging and proposing solutions to the key challenges identified (feature identification, intervention design, scalability, generalization, fairness balance)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. It presents a logical structure with distinct sections for introduction, methodology, experiments, and outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated. The two-stage methodology is broken down into algorithmic steps, including specific intervention types (masking, swapping, scaling) and quantification metrics (SSS, IDS). Experimental details (datasets, baselines, metrics) are provided. However, minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism of 'path-based merging' and the specifics of the 'adapter layer' used in the contrastive learning stage, which could benefit from slight refinement for perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While causal interventions and model pruning/fine-tuning are known concepts, the specific combination of using mechanistic interventions (targeting hidden activations) for fine-grained causal *attribution* at scale, and then using these quantitative scores to guide *structural pruning* and *contrastive reweighting* appears novel. It distinguishes itself from cited works like CCR (different methodology) and SEraser (train-time adaptation vs. test-time prompting). The approach offers a fresh perspective on integrating causality directly into model architecture modification for robustness."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established concepts like causal inference (interventions), mechanistic interpretability, model pruning, and contrastive learning. The proposed methodology, including intervention types and quantification metrics (SSS, IDS based on KL divergence and L2 norm), is logical. However, the assumption that interventions on individual activations/clusters perfectly isolate causal effects is an approximation inherent to mechanistic interpretability. The formulation for 'path-based merging' (W_{new} = W_{upstream}^T \\cdot W_{downstream}) might require further justification or refinement depending on architectural specifics (e.g., handling non-linearities, biases). Overall, the technical foundations are solid, but some aspects rely on strong assumptions or need slightly more detail."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant computational and implementation challenges. Stage 1 (Causal Attribution) requires numerous interventions across many inputs, layers, and units, which will be computationally expensive, especially for large models like LLaMA-300M. Implementing targeted interventions and path-based merging requires careful engineering within complex FM architectures. Generating diverse and appropriate counterfactual pairs for interventions is also non-trivial. While the proposed datasets and base models are standard, the overall resource requirement (compute, time, engineering effort) is high. It's feasible in a well-resourced research setting but scaling poses challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles critical and pervasive issues in foundation models: spurious correlations, lack of robustness, hallucinations, and bias, which are central to the R2-FM workshop's goals. Successfully developing a method to causally identify and remove spurious features would represent a major advancement in building more reliable, trustworthy, and fair AI systems. The potential impact spans improved OOD generalization, reduced harmful biases, and increased transparency, with clear benefits for high-stakes applications mentioned (healthcare, finance)."
