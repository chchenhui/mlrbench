    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea (RSM-NM) is highly consistent with the task description ('Unifying Representations in Neural Models'). It directly addresses the 'When' (developing methods to measure similarity) and 'What for' (applications in model merging) aspects highlighted in the task. The focus on representation similarity metrics aligns perfectly with the workshop's core theme and listed topics like 'Representation similarity analysis', 'Similarity measures in NNs', and 'Model merging'. It aims to provide tools for unifying representations, a central goal of the task. While it focuses more on the ML perspective, the problem it tackles is relevant to the cross-disciplinary goals mentioned."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation explicitly states the problem (lack of predictive metrics for merging). The main idea clearly outlines the proposed solution: a framework with specific, named metrics (FSI, GAS, SCM), a method for combining them (meta-learning), a validation strategy (cross-modality/architecture), and an application beyond prediction (guiding interventions). The objectives are unambiguous and the overall concept is immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While representation similarity analysis itself is not new (e.g., CKA, RSA), the specific focus on creating *predictive* metrics to assess mergeability *before* attempting the merge is innovative. The proposed combination of metrics, particularly the Gradient Alignment Score (GAS) applied in this context, and the use of meta-learning to create a predictive score, offers fresh perspectives. Furthermore, using these metrics to guide interventions for improving compatibility adds another layer of novelty beyond simple prediction."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible. Calculating the proposed metrics (FSI based on activations, GAS based on gradients, SCM based on geometric/subspace analysis) relies on standard operations in deep learning. While potentially computationally intensive, especially GAS and generating the meta-learning dataset (requiring multiple merge experiments), these steps are achievable with current technology and standard ML resources. The validation strategy across different data types and architectures is also standard practice. No fundamental technical barriers seem to prevent implementation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and impact potential. Model merging is an increasingly important technique for efficiency, knowledge consolidation, and improving robustness, yet it often lacks principled guidance. Developing reliable metrics to predict merging success *a priori* would be a major advancement, saving computational resources and enabling more systematic model fusion. Success would not only provide practical tools but could also yield deeper insights into the nature of representation similarity and the conditions under which independently trained models converge to compatible solutions, directly contributing to the workshop's goal of understanding and unifying representations."
