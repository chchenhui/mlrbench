        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the 'What for' aspect by focusing on practical applications like model merging, stitching, reuse, and cross-modal transfer through representational alignment. It explicitly targets key topics listed in the task description, such as 'Model merging, stitching and reuse', 'Representational alignment', and potentially 'Multimodal learning' and 'Similarity measures in NNs'. The motivation aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of unifying representations for practical benefits. While it doesn't deeply explore the 'Why' (underlying causes) or theoretical 'When' (emergence patterns), its strong focus on the application dimension makes it exceptionally relevant."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (Meta-Procrustes learner), mechanism (Procrustes alignment with linear + nonlinear components), meta-training strategy, and expected outcomes are explained logically. The steps involved in aligning a new pair of models are outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise architecture or capacity constraints of the 'low-capacity nonlinear residual' and the specifics of the meta-learning objective function, but these are details that can be elaborated upon. Overall, the research direction and proposed method are readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While representational alignment and Procrustes analysis are existing concepts in ML, the core novelty lies in the proposed 'Meta-Procrustes learner'. Applying meta-learning to train general-purpose, lightweight alignment modules that can quickly adapt to new model pairs using a small calibration set is innovative. This approach aims to learn *how* to align diverse models efficiently, rather than just aligning specific pairs. The combination of an orthonormal linear map with a learned nonlinear residual within this meta-learning framework further distinguishes it from purely linear alignment methods. The vision of enabling an interoperable 'model marketplace' is also a novel framing."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The core techniques (Procrustes analysis, meta-learning) are established. Accessing diverse pretrained models and tasks for meta-training is possible (e.g., via model hubs). Solving the Procrustes problem for alignment on small calibration sets should be computationally efficient. However, the meta-training phase itself could be computationally intensive, requiring significant resources to cover diverse architectures and tasks effectively. Ensuring the meta-learned alignment module generalizes well to unseen models/tasks and designing the 'low-capacity nonlinear residual' to be effective yet simple are key technical challenges. Overall, it's feasible with careful engineering and potentially substantial compute resources for the meta-learning stage."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance and impact potential. It addresses the critical challenge of representational misalignment, which currently hinders modularity, reuse, and efficient transfer learning in deep learning. A successful framework for generic, efficient alignment could unlock substantial practical benefits: enabling seamless model merging/stitching, accelerating multi-task and cross-modal learning, reducing redundant training, and fostering a more composable AI ecosystem (the 'model marketplace' concept). Solving this problem would represent a major advancement in making pretrained models more interoperable and useful."
