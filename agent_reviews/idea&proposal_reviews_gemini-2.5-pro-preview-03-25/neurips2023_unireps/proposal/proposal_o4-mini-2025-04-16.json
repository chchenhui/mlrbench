        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of unifying representations across models, specifically focusing on model merging and representational alignment in a multimodal context, which are key topics mentioned in the task description. The methodology using Optimal Transport (OT) and invertible mappings directly follows the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal effectively situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant works (AlignMamba, Sung et al., DecAlign, CMOT, Smith et al., Martinez et al.) and clearly articulating how it addresses identified gaps, particularly the combination of precise OT coupling, provably invertible mappings, and lightweight fusion without full model retraining."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated and logically structured. The methodology section provides a detailed and unambiguous description of the proposed techniques, including the OT formulation (entropic regularization, Sinkhorn algorithm), the parameterization and training objective for the invertible mapping (RealNVP), the identifiability analysis, the fusion mechanism (cross-attention), and the composite loss function. The experimental design is thorough, specifying datasets, backbones, baselines, metrics, and implementation details. The mathematical notation is precise and well-explained, contributing to the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While individual components like Optimal Transport for alignment, invertible neural networks (INNs), and model merging exist in the literature (as acknowledged), the specific combination proposed appears innovative. The core novelty lies in using OT to find a coupling between latent distributions and then explicitly training a *provably invertible* neural network (like RealNVP) to realize this alignment, aiming to preserve individual model functionality. This contrasts with prior OT works that might lack guaranteed invertibility or focus on token-level alignment, and empirical merging studies that may not use principled OT alignment. The emphasis on lightweight fusion post-alignment without retraining the backbones further adds to the novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations, namely Optimal Transport theory and the principles of Invertible Neural Networks. The choice of entropic-regularized OT with the Sinkhorn algorithm is appropriate for computational efficiency. Parameterizing the mapping with RealNVP/Glow guarantees invertibility by construction. The objective function for training the mapping logically connects it to the OT plan. The proposed fusion mechanism (cross-attention) is standard and effective. The identifiability analysis, referencing Brenier's theorem and its extensions, provides theoretical backing, even if the proof sketch is brief. Technical formulations are correct and clearly presented."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible. The core technical components – entropic OT (computable via Sinkhorn, with available libraries), Invertible Neural Networks (standard architectures), and cross-attention modules – are well-established and implementable using standard deep learning frameworks and hardware (GPUs). The requirement for paired cross-modal datasets (MS-COCO, VQA v2) is met by publicly available benchmarks. Freezing the pre-trained backbones significantly reduces the computational burden compared to end-to-end training, making the approach practical for typical research settings. Potential challenges like OT scaling or balancing the loss terms appear manageable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in machine learning: the efficient merging and reuse of powerful pre-trained models, particularly across modalities. Success would have substantial impact by potentially democratizing the creation of complex multimodal systems (reducing compute costs), enabling more modular and flexible AI architectures (e.g., for robotics), and reducing the environmental footprint of AI training. Furthermore, it promises valuable theoretical insights into representation alignment, identifiability, and the geometric structure of latent spaces, bridging OT theory with practical deep learning challenges. The potential contributions are substantial and clearly articulated."
