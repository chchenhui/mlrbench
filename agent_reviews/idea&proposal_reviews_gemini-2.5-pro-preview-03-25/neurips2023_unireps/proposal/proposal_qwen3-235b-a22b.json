    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core theme of unifying representations across modalities, focusing on model merging ('What for') and using OT to bridge modality gaps ('When/Why'). It elaborates precisely on the research idea, detailing the OT methodology, fusion mechanism, and evaluation plan. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as modality heterogeneity, semantic consistency, and identifiability, positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section details the data, OT formulation, fusion architecture, and experimental design logically. The significance and expected outcomes are clearly stated. A minor ambiguity exists in the description of the invertible mapping: parameterizing the transport plan T as PDP^T to ensure bijectivity between feature spaces needs more precise explanation, as T is typically a coupling, not a transformation matrix itself. Despite this specific point needing refinement, the overall proposal is easy to understand."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates satisfactory originality. While using Optimal Transport for cross-modal alignment is not entirely new (as evidenced by several papers in the literature review, e.g., AlignMamba, DecAlign, CMOT), the proposal's novelty lies in the specific combination of elements: 1) Applying OT to align pre-trained models for merging without full retraining, 2) A strong emphasis on achieving invertibility to preserve individual model functionality (though the proposed mechanism needs clarification), and 3) The goal of seamless merging using fixed cross-attention layers post-alignment. The theoretical investigation into OT's preservation of invariances also adds a novel aspect. It builds upon existing work but offers a distinct focus on invertibility and retraining-free fusion."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has a notable weakness in the methodology. The use of OT and the Sinkhorn algorithm is well-founded. The experimental design with baselines and metrics is appropriate. However, the proposed method for ensuring invertibility by parameterizing the transport plan T as PDP^T is technically questionable or at least poorly explained. The transport plan T represents mass flow between distributions, not typically a linear transformation itself. This specific technical formulation regarding invertibility lacks rigor and needs significant clarification or correction. If this mechanism is flawed, it undermines Objective 3 (Preserve Functionality). The rest of the methodology (OT for alignment, cross-attention for fusion) is generally sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Required datasets and pre-trained models are accessible. Implementing OT alignment (Sinkhorn) and cross-attention is standard, although OT can be computationally intensive for very large N, requiring efficient implementations or approximations. The main uncertainty lies in the proposed invertibility mechanism; if it requires significant revision, it could add complexity. Evaluating the proposed metrics is straightforward. Achieving high performance with completely fixed fusion layers might be optimistic and require some light tuning, but the core goal of avoiding full retraining seems achievable. Overall, the project is practical with manageable risks, assuming the invertibility aspect can be soundly addressed."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of efficiently merging pre-trained models across different modalities, which is a major bottleneck in building complex, reusable AI systems. Success would lead to substantial benefits, including significant reductions in computational costs for training multimodal models, democratization of model reuse, and advancements in applications requiring cross-modal reasoning (robotics, VQA, embodied AI). The focus on preserving individual model functionality and the potential theoretical insights into representation alignment further enhance its significance, aligning well with the broader goals outlined in the task description."
