        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on AI for cell and gene therapies using Foundation Models (FMs), incorporating multi-modal data (perturbations, transcriptomics, proteomics, networks, phenotypes), active learning fine-tuning, and interpretability, all mentioned in the task/idea. It positions itself clearly against relevant models (MAMMAL, scMMGPT, BioMedGPT) cited in the literature review and tackles key challenges identified therein, such as data integration and generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. Objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides substantial detail on data sources, preprocessing, model architecture (including specific components like transformers, GNNs, cross-attention with equations), pre-training objectives, active learning strategy, and a comprehensive evaluation plan. The structure is logical, making it easy to understand the proposed research from motivation to expected impact."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While multi-modal foundation models and the constituent architectures (Transformers, GNNs) exist (as shown in the literature review), the specific application to predict therapeutic outcomes (efficacy, safety, delivery) in cell/gene therapies by integrating genetic perturbations, multi-omic readouts, molecular networks, *and* phenotypic data within a single hybrid FM framework is innovative. The combination with active learning fine-tuning using lab-generated data for this specific problem adds to the novelty. It's not proposing entirely new ML techniques but rather a novel and sophisticated integration tailored to a complex biological problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon well-established ML techniques (Transformers, GNNs, attention mechanisms, standard pre-training objectives, active learning). The proposed methodology is detailed, technically coherent, and well-justified for the problem domain. The inclusion of specific equations, clear descriptions of model components, a robust evaluation plan (baselines, metrics, cross-validation, ablations, interpretability), and consideration of computational resources demonstrates technical depth and rigor. The technical formulations appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. Accessing public data and implementing the model architecture with specified computational resources (A100/V100 GPUs) are standard for FM research. The main challenge lies in generating the proposed 10,000 lab-based perturbation-response pairs with multi-omic readouts, which is resource-intensive (time, cost). The active learning loop, requiring tight integration between computation and wet-lab experiments, adds logistical complexity. However, the plan is detailed, acknowledges resource needs, and the active learning component aims to mitigate experimental cost, making it challenging but plausibly achievable within a well-resourced project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical bottlenecks in cell and gene therapy development â€“ predicting efficacy, safety (off-target effects), and delivery efficiency. Success would accelerate the translation of these transformative therapies, potentially reducing R&D costs and improving patient outcomes. The integration of diverse biological modalities addresses a key scientific challenge, and the focus on interpretability and open-sourcing enhances its potential contribution to both basic science and translational medicine."
