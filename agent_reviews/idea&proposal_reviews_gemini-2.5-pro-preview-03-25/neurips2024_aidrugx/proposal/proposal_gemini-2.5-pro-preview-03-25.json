        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with all provided materials. It directly addresses the task description's focus on AI for new drug modalities (specifically cell and gene therapies) and the ML track's interest in multi-modal foundation models integrating perturbation/readout data, fine-tuning, and interpretability. The proposal meticulously expands on the research idea, detailing the multi-modal architecture, data integration, pre-training, and active learning fine-tuning strategy. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and references the literature review, citing relevant papers (e.g., MAMMAL, perturbation prediction, GNNs, active learning) and explicitly addressing key challenges identified (data integration, interpretability, limited data)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear, well-defined, and logically structured. The background, research gap, proposed solution (IntegraGene), objectives, and significance are articulated precisely in the introduction. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step description of data collection/preprocessing, model architecture (including specific components like encoders, cross-modal attention, and prediction heads), pre-training strategy, active learning loop, validation plan (tasks, datasets, baselines, metrics), and interpretability methods. The language is unambiguous, and the overall presentation makes the research plan easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While leveraging existing components like foundation models, transformers, GNNs, cross-modal attention, and active learning (referenced in the literature review), its novelty lies in the specific synthesis and application. It proposes a dedicated foundation model (IntegraGene) explicitly designed to integrate *causal* perturbation data (characteristic of C&G therapies like CRISPR) with *multi-modal* downstream biological readouts (transcriptomic, proteomic, phenotypic). This focus distinguishes it from existing FMs often aimed at descriptive tasks or small molecule perturbations (as suggested by Lit Review #2). The combination of this specific FM architecture with an active learning strategy for fine-tuning using scarce C&G experimental data further enhances its originality in addressing the specific challenges of this domain."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is well-grounded in the challenges of C&G therapy and leverages established, state-of-the-art ML techniques appropriate for the data types and tasks involved (transformers for sequences, GNNs for interactions - Lit Review #7, cross-modal attention for integration, self-supervised learning for pre-training, standard active learning strategies - Lit Review #10). The proposed architecture is logical, the data sources are relevant, and the validation plan is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines and metrics. The inclusion of interpretability methods addresses a key challenge (Lit Review Key Challenges #2). The technical approach is well-justified and aligns with best practices in multi-modal ML and bioinformatics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but faces significant practical challenges. Strengths include the use of public data for pre-training and active learning to optimize the use of lab data. However, major hurdles exist: 1) Acquiring sufficient high-quality, multi-modal perturbation-response data specifically for C&G therapies (for fine-tuning and validation) is notoriously difficult and expensive, even with active learning. Collaboration or access to proprietary data is crucial but not guaranteed. 2) Training large-scale multi-modal foundation models and performing iterative active learning retraining demands substantial computational resources (Lit Review Key Challenges #5). 3) The active learning loop requires potentially complex integration with experimental workflows, which could introduce delays. While technically plausible, these resource and data constraints lower the feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and addresses a critical need in modern medicine. Cell and gene therapies hold immense promise but face major development bottlenecks related to predicting efficacy, safety (off-target effects), and cellular responses. By aiming to create a predictive tool that integrates the complex interplay between therapeutic perturbations and multi-modal biological outcomes, IntegraGene directly tackles these bottlenecks. Success would have a substantial impact by accelerating the design-test cycle, reducing costs, improving the safety/efficacy profiles of C&G therapies, and ultimately facilitating their clinical translation. It also contributes significantly to the field of biological foundation models by addressing causal inference in a multi-modal setting, aligning perfectly with the task description's goals."
