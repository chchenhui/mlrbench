        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on AI for cell/gene therapies (Application Track) and foundational models using multi-modal data and perturbations (ML Track). The methodology closely follows the research idea, proposing a hybrid transformer-GNN architecture for integrating genetic perturbations and multi-omics readouts. It effectively incorporates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as leveraging FMs (MAMMAL, scMMGPT), integrating multi-modal data, predicting CRISPR effects, and using active learning to mitigate limited annotated data (Challenge 3). The objectives and expected outcomes directly map to the goals outlined in the task and idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to methodology and expected impact. The core concepts, such as the hybrid architecture (transformer + GNN), cross-modal attention, and the active learning loop, are explained well, including relevant equations for the encoders. The data sources, preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics are clearly listed. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature and integration method for 'phenotypic' and 'imaging' data, the lack of detail on the LNP diffusion model, and the simplicity of the example off-target score formula. However, these do not significantly obscure the overall research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While leveraging existing components like transformers, GNNs, multi-modal FMs (cited in literature), and active learning, its novelty lies in their specific combination and application. The development of a *unified* FM specifically designed to model the complex chain from genetic/molecular perturbation through multi-omics responses to predict *therapeutic outcomes* (efficacy, safety, delivery) in the CGT context is a novel contribution. The proposed hybrid architecture tailored for this task and the integration of an active learning loop to refine predictions using lab feedback specifically for CGT optimization distinguishes it from prior work like MAMMAL (general bio-modalities) or scMMGPT (single-cell + text)."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established ML techniques (transformers, GAT, cross-modal attention, contrastive learning, active learning) and relevant biological data sources. The methodology outlines a plausible approach for data integration, model training, and evaluation. However, some aspects could be strengthened: 1) Integrating the highly diverse data modalities presents significant technical challenges not fully elaborated upon. 2) The claim of modeling 'causal' relationships might be too strong without explicit causal inference methods. 3) The provided off-target score formula is simplistic and likely requires more sophisticated biological features. 4) Details on the LNP generation (diffusion model) are missing. 5) The assumption that cross-modal attention will effectively capture the complex perturbation-response dynamics needs empirical validation. Despite these points, the overall technical foundation is solid."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Accessing public datasets is possible, but curating, cleaning, and harmonizing such diverse multi-modal data at scale is a major undertaking. Training the proposed large-scale hybrid FM will demand significant computational resources (Challenge 5 in literature). The active learning component requires a robust and potentially costly/time-consuming wet-lab validation pipeline (e.g., CRISPR screens, Guide-seq), demanding close collaboration and resources beyond computation. While technically achievable with sufficient funding, expertise, and time, the complexity of data integration and the reliance on an experimental feedback loop introduce significant risks and hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical bottlenecks in the development of cell and gene therapies â€“ a rapidly advancing field with transformative potential. Improving the prediction of therapeutic efficacy, off-target effects (safety), and delivery efficiency could dramatically accelerate the translation of CGTs to the clinic. Success would represent a major advancement in applying AI to complex biological problems, potentially reducing experimental costs and timelines significantly (as claimed). The release of a curated dataset and model would also be a valuable contribution to the research community, aligning perfectly with the workshop's aims."
