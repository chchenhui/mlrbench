    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal perfectly aligns with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on Foundational Models (FMs) for new drug modalities, specifically cell and gene therapies, by proposing a multi-modal FM integrating perturbation-response data. It elaborates precisely on the research idea, detailing the hybrid architecture, cross-modal attention, and active learning. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and builds upon the cited literature (MAMMAL, BioMedGPT, single-cell FMs, GNNs, Transformers, active learning, CRISPR prediction), positioning the work within the current research landscape and acknowledging relevant challenges."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology (including data sources, model architecture with mathematical formulations, training pipeline, active learning strategy, and experimental design), and expected impact are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. Minor points like the absence of the mentioned Figure 1 in the text and the high-level description of the GNN architecture prevent a perfect score, but overall clarity is excellent."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components (Transformers, GNNs, cross-modal attention, active learning, FMs) exist, their specific combination and application to predict multiple key therapeutic outcomes (efficacy, off-target, delivery) simultaneously for cell and gene therapies using perturbation-response dynamics within a unified FM framework is novel. It distinguishes itself from cited FMs like MAMMAL or BioMedGPT by its specific focus on perturbation-response, the hybrid sequence/graph architecture tailored for this, and the integration of active learning for fine-tuning in this context. The novelty lies in the synthesis and application rather than entirely new techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages well-established methods (Transformers, GNNs, attention, active learning) and grounds its approach in relevant literature. The hybrid architecture is plausible, the multi-task learning objective is appropriate, and the experimental design includes necessary baselines and ablations. The mathematical formulations presented are standard and correct. Minor weaknesses include the generic description of the GNN component and the inherent complexity of ensuring effective cross-modal alignment between diverse data types, which could benefit from further justification or preliminary evidence."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but faces practical challenges. Access to sufficient high-quality, multi-modal lab-generated perturbation-response data is a significant potential bottleneck, although the proposed active learning strategy aims to mitigate this. Training such a large-scale multi-modal FM requires substantial computational resources and specialized expertise in both ML and biology. While technically achievable, the resource requirements and data dependency introduce moderate risks to successful implementation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical bottlenecks (efficacy prediction, off-target effects, delivery efficiency) in the development of cell and gene therapies, a transformative area of medicine. Success would likely accelerate therapeutic development, improve safety, reduce costs, and potentially yield new biological insights through model interpretability (e.g., attention maps). The potential contributions to both clinical translation and fundamental understanding are substantial."
