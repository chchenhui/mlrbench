        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (improving ASO stability/efficacy), the main approach (generative models trained on sequence/property data, refined via RL with simulation/experimental feedback), and the expected outcomes (optimized ASO library, accelerated development). The components are logically connected and easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using AI for molecular design, including ASOs, is an active research area, the proposed combination of generative models specifically for ASOs coupled with an RL-driven refinement loop incorporating feedback from molecular simulations and *in vitro* experiments offers a notable advancement over simpler predictive or generative approaches. It integrates multiple advanced AI techniques in a specific, challenging application."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Key hurdles include: 1) Acquiring a sufficiently large, high-quality dataset linking ASO sequences to reliable stability and *in vitro* efficacy data. 2) The computational cost of training large generative models and RL agents. 3) The practical integration of potentially slow and expensive molecular simulations and *in vitro* experiments into an efficient RL feedback loop. Success depends heavily on data availability and efficient experimental validation cycles."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. ASOs represent a crucial class of emerging therapeutics, but their design remains challenging. Successfully developing an AI system that optimizes ASO stability and efficacy could dramatically accelerate the development pipeline for RNA-targeted therapies, potentially leading to breakthroughs for various genetic, infectious, and other diseases. It addresses a critical bottleneck in drug discovery."
