        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. It directly addresses 'AI for therapeutic RNAs (e.g., optimizing UTR/codons to enhance translational efficiency for mRNA vaccines)' mentioned in the Application Track. Furthermore, it incorporates multiple elements highlighted in the ML Track, including being a large-scale generative model ('Foundation Model'), using a 'new diffusion model', modeling 'multimodal aspects' (sequence, structure, function), employing a 'long-range neural network architecture' (transformer), and proposing 'Fine-tuning foundational models from lab feedback' via RL. It hits nearly every relevant keyword and concept mentioned in the task description for both tracks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is very clearly articulated. The motivation (slow mRNA design), the proposed solution (DiffuRNAS), its core components (diffusion model, multimodal data, transformer, RL fine-tuning), and the expected outcomes (optimized library, toolkit, faster design) are well-defined and easy to understand. The technical approach is described concisely. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact nature of the 'functional annotations' or the specifics of the RL implementation, but the overall concept is crystal clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models are increasingly used for biological sequences and transformers are standard, the proposed combination for *multimodal* mRNA optimization (jointly considering sequence, predicted structure, and functional properties like expression/immunogenicity) is innovative. Furthermore, integrating score-based diffusion with reinforcement learning specifically tuned by *wet-lab feedback* for therapeutic mRNA design represents a fresh and sophisticated approach compared to simpler optimization heuristics or models focusing only on sequence."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant challenges. The core ML components (diffusion models, transformers, RL) are computationally intensive but implementable. However, the primary hurdles are: 1) Data Availability: Requires large-scale, high-quality datasets linking mRNA sequences (UTR-ORF variants) to reliable measurements of translation efficiency and immunogenicity, which are expensive and difficult to generate. 2) Wet-Lab Integration: Implementing the RL fine-tuning loop with wet-lab feedback requires tight, potentially slow, and costly integration between computational modeling and experimental validation. While conceptually sound, the practical execution of this loop presents logistical and resource challenges. 3) Structure Prediction Accuracy: Relies on predicted secondary structures, which may introduce noise or inaccuracies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. mRNA technology is a forefront area in vaccine development and therapeutics. Optimizing mRNA design to maximize efficacy (protein expression) and minimize side effects (immunogenicity) is a critical bottleneck. Successfully developing DiffuRNAS could dramatically accelerate the design-build-test cycle for mRNA therapeutics, potentially leading to faster development of life-saving vaccines and treatments. The proposed open-source toolkit could broadly benefit the field."
