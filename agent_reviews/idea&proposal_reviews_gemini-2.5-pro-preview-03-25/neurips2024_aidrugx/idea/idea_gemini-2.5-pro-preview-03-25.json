        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. It directly addresses 'AI for cell and gene therapies (e.g., ... AI-based CRISPR design)' mentioned in the Application Track. Furthermore, it explicitly proposes using a Foundational Model (FM), integrating multi-modal data (genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics), leveraging biological knowledge (cellular context), using long-range sequence models (transformers), and fine-tuning from experimental data, all of which are key themes highlighted in the ML track (Foundational Models for Drug Discovery)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (improving gRNA specificity), the problem (neglect of cellular context), the proposed solution (context-aware FM using multi-modal data), the model architecture (transformer-based), the inputs/outputs (genomic locus + context -> efficiency/specificity), and the potential impact (safer therapies). The specific data modalities (ATAC-seq, methylation, transcriptomics) are mentioned, making the proposal concrete and immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While foundational models are increasingly used in genomics, the specific application to CRISPR gRNA design that explicitly incorporates *cell-type-specific* multi-modal data (epigenetics, transcriptomics) as context is innovative. Most current tools are context-agnostic or use simpler models. Integrating these diverse data types into a large transformer model to predict context-dependent outcomes represents a fresh and advanced approach compared to existing methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Pre-training on genomic data and building large transformer models are technically feasible with sufficient computational resources. However, acquiring comprehensive, high-quality, cell-type-specific multi-modal datasets (ATAC-seq, methylation, transcriptomics) linked to reliable experimental gRNA on-target/off-target data across diverse cell types for fine-tuning is a major hurdle. Data availability, heterogeneity, and the cost of generating new experimental validation data pose considerable challenges, requiring significant effort and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Off-target effects and achieving cell-type specificity are critical challenges limiting the safety and efficacy of CRISPR-based therapies. Developing a tool that accurately predicts gRNA performance within specific cellular contexts would be a major advancement. Success could dramatically improve the design process for gene editing tools, leading to safer, more effective cell and gene therapies tailored to specific tissues, thus having a substantial impact on translational medicine."
