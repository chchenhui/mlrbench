    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on information-theoretic principles (specifically IB) applied to cognitive systems, particularly human-AI communication and cooperation. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the IB formulation, variational methods, and RL approach. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the provided literature, citing key papers like Tucker et al. (2022) and positioning the work as an extension towards human-AI interaction, explicitly addressing challenges mentioned in the review like balancing information/complexity and considering human limits."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, objectives, theoretical framework (IB formulation), high-level methodology (VIB, RL, human-in-the-loop), and experimental plan are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. Key terms are defined. However, minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of 'task-relevant information Y' and the exact integration mechanism of the 'Human Understanding Model' within the overall optimization loop (its role relative to the VIB objective vs. the RL reward could be slightly more explicit). The adaptive beta mechanism is clear conceptually but lacks specifics on the 'Performance_t' measure. These minor points slightly detract from perfect clarity but do not obscure the core proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While applying IB to communication or representation learning isn't entirely new (as shown in the literature review, e.g., Wang et al. 2020, Tucker et al. 2022, Islam et al. 2023), the specific focus on optimizing *human*-AI communication in cooperative tasks using IB, combined with human-in-the-loop RL refinement and an adaptive complexity mechanism based on performance, represents a novel synthesis and extension. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior agent-agent communication work by centering the human cognitive aspect. The novelty lies in this specific application, integration of methods, and focus on the human element, rather than a completely groundbreaking theoretical concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the established Information Bottleneck theory and utilizes standard, appropriate techniques like variational inference (VIB/VQ-VIB) and reinforcement learning (policy gradients). The proposed architecture and two-phase training approach (simulation + human-in-the-loop) are logical. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse tasks, and multi-faceted evaluation metrics (performance, efficiency, human factors, IT measures). Potential challenges like MI estimation and human modeling are acknowledged implicitly through the choice of methods and evaluation. The technical formulations presented are correct and standard within the VIB literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. It requires expertise across deep learning, RL, information theory, and human-computer interaction, along with substantial computational resources and human subject recruitment/experimentation infrastructure. Integrating VIB, RL, human modeling, and human-in-the-loop training is complex and likely requires significant engineering effort and tuning. While the individual components are based on existing technologies and methods, their combination poses practical hurdles. The human studies component (60 participants, 3 domains, 4 conditions) is ambitious but standard for the field. Overall, it's a challenging but achievable research plan given adequate resources and time."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the inefficiency of communication in human-AI collaboration, which is a major barrier to the effectiveness and adoption of AI systems in complex, real-world tasks. By leveraging the principled IB framework to create AI communication strategies that are both informative and mindful of human cognitive limits, the research has the potential for substantial impact. Success could lead to more effective human-AI teams, more intuitive AI interfaces, and advances in understanding both artificial and human cognitive systems, aligning well with the goals of human-aligned AI."
