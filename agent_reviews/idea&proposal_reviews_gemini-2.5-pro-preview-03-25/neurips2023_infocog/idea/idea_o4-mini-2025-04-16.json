        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea aligns excellently with the task description (InfoCog workshop). It directly addresses one of the explicitly listed topics: 'Application of information theory to training human-aligned artificial agents'. It leverages information-theoretic principles (Information Bottleneck, Mutual Information) for artificial cognition (agent representations). Furthermore, it mentions using neural mutual information estimators (MINE, variational bounds), connecting to the workshop's special emphasis on computation/estimation of IT quantities. The goal of improving human-AI communication and cooperation also touches upon cognitive functions like social reasoning. The proposed validation aligns with the topic of 'validation of information-theoretic formalism in... artificial cognition'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core method (HVIB with its objective function), the role of human feedback (Y_h), and the validation plan are explained. The hierarchical structure (coarse-to-fine) is described. While the core concept is understandable, minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise architecture, the exact nature and collection method for human feedback (Y_h), and the specifics of the MI estimators used. However, the overall proposal is well-defined and communicates the central idea effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While the core components (Information Bottleneck, Variational IB, Hierarchical VIB, MI estimators) are existing concepts, the specific application and formulation are innovative. Applying a hierarchical bottleneck specifically optimized layer-by-layer for predicting human feedback (Y_h), conditioned on previous layers (I(zᵢ;Y_h∣z_{<i})), to generate interpretable representations for human-aligned agents offers a fresh perspective. It's a novel combination and refinement of existing techniques tailored to the specific challenge of human-AI alignment through representation learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It relies on established techniques like Variational Information Bottleneck and neural mutual information estimation (MINE, variational bounds), which have existing implementations. The proposed validation tasks (cooperative navigation, dialogue) are common research environments. However, practical challenges exist: neural MI estimation can be unstable and require careful tuning; defining, collecting, and integrating human feedback (Y_h) effectively requires careful experimental design and potentially significant effort. While implementable, successful execution requires addressing these non-trivial technical aspects."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Improving human-AI alignment, communication, and trust is a critical research direction as AI systems become more pervasive. Developing interpretable representations that capture human-relevant aspects is key to this goal. This work proposes a principled, information-theoretic approach to this problem. If successful, the HVIB framework could provide a valuable tool for building AI agents that collaborate more effectively and transparently with humans, contributing meaningfully to AI safety and human-AI interaction research."
