        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. The task calls for submissions on novel methods for computation/estimation of information-theoretic quantities and their application to human and artificial cognition, emphasizing interdisciplinary work and connections between estimation methods and cognitive systems. The proposed idea directly addresses this by developing a novel neural-variational framework, guided by cognitive priors, specifically for estimating information dynamics in high-dimensional cognitive systems (both human and artificial). It explicitly mentions bridging ML and cognitive science, targeting applications like AI interpretability and modeling human decision-making, and aims to produce a toolkit â€“ all fitting squarely within the workshop's scope and special emphasis."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (challenges in estimating information dynamics), the core technical approach (hybrid neural-variational framework with cognitive priors), the validation strategy (benchmarks, real data), and the expected outcomes (toolkit, applications). The concepts like 'cognitive priors' (attention sparsity, hierarchical processing) and 'structured variational bounds' are mentioned, giving a good sense of the direction. While the exact mathematical formulation isn't detailed (which is expected for an idea summary), the overall concept, goals, and methodology are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While neural estimation of information quantities and variational methods exist, the core novelty lies in the proposed *integration* of cognitive priors (like attention sparsity, hierarchical processing, resource efficiency) directly into the neural-variational estimation framework for *high-dimensional, time-varying* systems. This cognitively-guided approach to regularizing or structuring the estimator, aiming to improve accuracy and scalability by leveraging domain knowledge about cognitive processes, represents a fresh perspective compared to purely data-driven or generic physics-inspired priors often used in ML."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The components (neural networks, variational methods, high-dimensional datasets) are available. However, the key challenge lies in effectively formalizing and implementing the 'cognitive priors' as constraints or regularizers within the optimization framework. Translating concepts like 'attention sparsity' or 'resource efficiency' into mathematically sound and computationally tractable forms that genuinely improve estimation requires careful theoretical work and empirical validation. While achievable with current ML expertise, it requires significant research effort beyond standard off-the-shelf techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Accurately estimating information dynamics in high-dimensional systems like the brain or complex AI agents is a fundamental bottleneck in cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI interpretability. Success would provide powerful tools for analyzing neural data, understanding cognitive mechanisms (e.g., decision-making), and explaining the behavior of AI systems. The potential to bridge ML scalability with cognitive plausibility addresses a critical gap, and the development of an open-source toolkit would broadly disseminate the impact across multiple fields."
