    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions on the 'Application of information theory to training human-aligned artificial agents, i.e., agents that can better communicate and cooperate with humans'. The proposed idea directly addresses this by using mutual information (MI) to enhance human-agent communication and alignment. It also aligns with the workshop's interdisciplinary nature (ML, CogSci, Info Theory) and its focus on information-theoretic approaches to cognitive functions (communication) and potentially the computation/estimation of IT quantities (MI estimation component)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is satisfactorily clear at a high level. The motivation, overall goal (using MI for better communication), and the three main components (estimation, optimization, co-evolution) are stated. However, the proposal lacks detail on the specific methodologies. How will MI be estimated in the complex context of human-agent interaction? What optimization techniques will be used? How will the co-evolutionary process be implemented practically? These crucial details are ambiguous, requiring further elaboration for a complete understanding of the proposed approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using information theory, including MI, in cognitive science and AI is not entirely new, the specific application proposed here has notable original aspects. Framing human-agent communication enhancement explicitly around MI estimation, using MI directly as an objective for optimizing AI responses, and proposing a co-evolutionary adaptation mechanism based on MI appears to be a fresh combination and application of these concepts in the context of human-aligned AI. It integrates existing ideas in a novel framework focused on communication dynamics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is satisfactory but presents significant challenges. Estimating mutual information accurately and efficiently, especially between complex systems like a human and an AI agent interacting through potentially high-dimensional modalities (e.g., language), is notoriously difficult. It requires robust estimators and potentially large amounts of data. Optimizing communication strategies based on these estimates in real-time or near real-time adds computational complexity. Furthermore, implementing a stable and effective co-evolutionary dynamic based on potentially noisy MI signals is non-trivial. Significant technical hurdles exist, particularly concerning the MI estimation component."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant and has clear potential impact. Improving the quality, naturalness, and effectiveness of human-agent communication is a critical challenge in AI development. Success in this research could lead to more trustworthy, intuitive, and user-friendly AI systems (e.g., assistants, collaborators). Grounding communication quality in a fundamental concept like mutual information offers a principled approach that could advance both AI engineering and the theoretical understanding of communication in cognitive systems. It directly addresses the important goal of creating human-aligned AI."
