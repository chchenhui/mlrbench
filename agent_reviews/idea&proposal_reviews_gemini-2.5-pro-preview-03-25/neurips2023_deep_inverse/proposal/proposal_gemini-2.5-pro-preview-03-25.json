        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's core challenge of model uncertainty in inverse problems using partial system information, aiming for reliable solutions. It meticulously expands on the research idea of using meta-learning for robustness against a distribution of forward models. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and positions itself relative to the provided literature review, citing relevant papers and acknowledging the key challenges identified therein. The objectives and methodology directly stem from the initial idea and the context provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and motivation to specific objectives, detailed methodology, and expected outcomes. Key concepts like meta-learning tasks, forward model distributions (p(A)), and the MAML algorithm are explained clearly. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The experimental plan is detailed and easy to follow. There is minimal ambiguity, making the proposal readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While meta-learning and addressing model uncertainty are existing concepts, applying meta-learning specifically to train inverse problem solvers for robustness against a *distribution* of forward models offers a fresh perspective. This approach differs significantly from the cited methods like untrained network components, direct UQ, or standard Bayesian techniques. The novelty lies in framing the robustness problem as a meta-learning challenge focused on generalization or rapid adaptation across varying physical models, which is well-articulated and justified."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in inverse problems, deep learning, and meta-learning (MAML). The proposed methodology, including the use of MAML or an average performance objective, perturbed forward model generation, standard network architectures (U-Net, unrolled networks), and a comprehensive evaluation plan, is robust and well-justified. Technical descriptions, like the MAML update rules, are presented correctly and clearly. The approach logically connects meta-learning principles to the goal of achieving robustness against model uncertainty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard deep learning resources, publicly available benchmark datasets (FastMRI, CelebA, etc.), and established techniques like MAML. Generating perturbed forward models for the examples given (blur, MRI) is practical. The experimental plan is detailed and realistic. The main challenge lies in the potential computational expense and training complexity/stability often associated with meta-learning algorithms like MAML, but this is a known aspect of the technique and seems manageable within a research context, not a fundamental roadblock."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical bottleneck in the practical deployment of deep learning for inverse problems: sensitivity to forward model mismatch. Success would lead to more reliable and trustworthy solutions, crucial for applications like medical imaging and scientific discovery, directly aligning with the workshop's goals. Methodologically, it introduces meta-learning as a principled approach for this problem, potentially advancing the understanding of generalization in physics-informed ML. The potential impact on both practical applications and scientific understanding is substantial."
