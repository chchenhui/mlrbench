        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses two key topics mentioned: 1) Tackling model uncertainty in learning-based inverse problems, especially with partial system information, by proposing a Bayesian neural surrogate for the forward model. 2) Utilizing diffusion models for inverse problems by proposing a novel way to integrate the uncertain forward model into the diffusion sampling process. The goal of achieving 'trustworthy imaging' and 'quantified error guarantees' also matches the workshop's aim for 'reliable, and trustworthy learning-based solutions'."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly states the problem (inaccurate forward models in diffusion solvers). The main idea is concisely presented as a two-stage framework involving training a Bayesian surrogate and embedding it into diffusion sampling via an expected log-likelihood gradient. Key technical details like using Monte Carlo draws and the target validation domains (CT, MRI) are mentioned. It is immediately understandable, with only minor details (e.g., specific BNN architecture or diffusion sampler variant) left unspecified, which is appropriate for a research idea summary."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using diffusion models for inverse problems and addressing model uncertainty are active research areas, the specific approach of integrating a *Bayesian* neural surrogate (explicitly capturing epistemic uncertainty) into the diffusion sampling process by modifying the data consistency term based on the *expected* log-likelihood over the surrogate's posterior is innovative. It combines existing concepts (diffusion models, BNNs, surrogate modeling) in a non-trivial way to address the specific challenge of imperfect forward models in diffusion-based inversion, going beyond simpler deterministic surrogates or basic noise assumptions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Training diffusion models is standard but computationally intensive. Training Bayesian Neural Networks can also be complex and computationally demanding, requiring careful implementation (e.g., variational inference, MCMC). Integrating the two by computing Monte Carlo estimates of the expected gradient within each diffusion sampling step will add significant computational overhead compared to standard methods assuming a known forward model. However, the required components (BNNs, diffusion models, MC estimation) are existing techniques, and the need for 'limited calibration data' is often realistic. The proposed validation domains are standard. Overall, it's achievable within a research context but requires significant computational resources and careful engineering."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Model uncertainty is a critical bottleneck for deploying deep learning methods for inverse problems in real-world, safety-critical applications like medical imaging and geophysics. This proposal directly tackles this limitation for powerful diffusion models. Providing reconstructions that are robust to model mismatch *and* come with quantified uncertainty would be a major advancement, increasing trust and reliability. Success would significantly impact fields where accurate forward models are difficult or impossible to obtain, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of developing trustworthy solutions."
