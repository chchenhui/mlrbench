        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the two highlighted topics: 1) 'Fundamental approaches to address model uncertainty in learning-based solutions for inverse problems', specifically the challenge of only having partial information about the system model, and 2) the application and extension of 'Diffusion models' for inverse problems. The proposal explicitly aims to overcome the limitation of current diffusion models requiring full forward operator knowledge, which is a core issue mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, highlighting the gap in current methods. The core proposal – integrating forward operator uncertainty into diffusion models via joint sampling and variational inference – is understandable. However, specifics regarding the parameterization of the forward operator distribution and the exact structure of the hierarchical variational framework could be slightly more detailed, though the current level is appropriate for an initial idea description."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While diffusion models for inverse problems and handling uncertainty in inverse problems are existing research areas, the proposed method of *jointly* sampling solutions and forward operators within the diffusion framework, combined with a hierarchical variational approach to explicitly model and refine forward operator parameters, represents a novel and innovative approach. It extends diffusion models beyond the standard assumption of a known forward operator in a non-trivial way."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Diffusion models are already computationally expensive. Adding joint sampling over solutions and forward operator parameters, plus implementing and optimizing a hierarchical variational inference scheme, will substantially increase complexity and computational demands. Success depends on careful design of the operator parameterization and the inference process, and may require significant computational resources and potentially large datasets representing operator variability. It builds on existing techniques but integrating them effectively will require considerable effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the limitation of requiring a fully known forward operator is crucial for applying advanced deep learning methods like diffusion models to many real-world inverse problems where such knowledge is often incomplete or uncertain (e.g., medical imaging calibration errors, unknown environmental parameters in remote sensing). Success would represent a major advancement, making these powerful generative models more robust and applicable to a wider range of practical scientific and engineering problems."
