        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on 'Fundamental approaches to address model uncertainty in learning-based solutions for inverse problems', highlighting the reliance on precise forward models as a key challenge. The proposed idea directly targets this challenge by using meta-learning to train solvers robust to forward model uncertainty, aiming for 'more effective, reliable, and trustworthy learning-based solutions' as sought by the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (robustness to model uncertainty), the core concept (meta-learning across a distribution of forward models), the mechanism (sampling perturbed models, meta-objective), and the expected outcome (generalization, reliability) are well-explained. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific meta-learning algorithm or the exact parameterization of the uncertainty distribution, but the overall research direction is clearly defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While deep learning for inverse problems and addressing model uncertainty are established areas, and meta-learning is a known technique, applying meta-learning specifically to train solvers that generalize across a *distribution* of forward models offers a fresh perspective within the inverse problems domain. It combines existing concepts in a specific way that is less explored than standard robustness techniques or domain randomization, offering a potentially innovative approach to the problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Meta-learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks for inverse problems are available. Simulating variations in forward models is often possible, especially in physics-based domains. However, challenges exist: defining a realistic and representative distribution of forward model uncertainties can be difficult, and meta-learning often incurs significant computational costs due to nested optimization loops. Implementation requires careful design of the uncertainty sampling and optimization strategy, but it is achievable with current technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Robustness to forward model uncertainty is a critical bottleneck limiting the practical deployment of deep learning-based inverse problem solvers in many real-world applications (e.g., medical imaging with calibration drift, geophysics with inaccurate earth models). Developing solvers that maintain performance despite model mismatch would represent a major advancement, enhancing reliability and trustworthiness, directly aligning with the workshop's goals and addressing a key challenge in the field."
