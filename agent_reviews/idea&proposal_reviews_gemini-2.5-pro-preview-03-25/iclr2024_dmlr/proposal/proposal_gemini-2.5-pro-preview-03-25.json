        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the task, such as data-centric ML for foundation models, model-assisted dataset construction, multi-domain challenges, data quality, and HCI in curation. The proposed UMC framework is a direct and detailed elaboration of the research idea. Furthermore, the proposal effectively integrates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the provided literature review (e.g., referencing Zha et al., Xu et al., Oala et al. on DCAI importance, and tackling issues like curation efficiency and balancing exploration/exploitation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to a detailed solution (UMC), specific objectives, methodology, and expected impact. Key concepts like ensemble uncertainty, MAB allocation, and the iterative process are explained clearly, aided by technical details (formulas) and a conceptual diagram. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The experimental design is well-articulated, outlining baselines, setup, and evaluation metrics. Only minor details (e.g., precise MAB reward formulation) could be further specified, but overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like uncertainty sampling, ensemble methods, MABs, and human-in-the-loop curation exist in the literature, their specific integration into the UMC framework for *scalable, multi-domain foundation model dataset curation* is novel. The key innovation lies in the synergistic combination: using ensemble uncertainty for robustness, clustering for curator efficiency, and particularly the MAB-based dynamic resource allocation to explicitly balance exploration across diverse domains/clusters and exploitation of difficult samples within the context of FM data curation. This integrated approach offers a fresh perspective compared to standard active learning or simpler model-assisted methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in active learning (uncertainty sampling), ensemble methods for improved robustness and uncertainty estimation, MABs for exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and standard machine learning practices (iterative retraining). The methodology is well-justified, logically structured, and technically detailed (e.g., specific uncertainty metrics, UCB1 formula). The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and comprehensive evaluation metrics covering efficiency, model performance, robustness, and data characteristics. The reliance on established techniques lends strong credibility to the approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but presents significant implementation challenges. It relies on standard ML libraries and pre-trained models. However, implementing the full UMC pipeline requires integrating multiple complex components (ensemble inference, uncertainty calculation, clustering, MAB logic, interactive interface, retraining loop). It demands substantial computational resources for FM training/inference, especially with ensembles. Accessing and managing large, diverse unlabeled datasets is necessary. The plan to use simulation for annotation budget evaluation is practical, but building the interactive interface and potentially running studies with human annotators adds complexity and cost. While achievable, it requires significant engineering effort and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in modern AI: the efficient creation of large-scale, high-quality, diverse datasets for training foundation models, aligning perfectly with the rise of data-centric AI. Success would lead to substantial cost reductions in data annotation, potentially democratizing FM development. It promises improvements in model robustness, generalization, and reliability, particularly across multiple domains. The research contributes novel methodologies to DCAI, active learning, and human-AI collaboration. The potential development of open-source tools and benchmark datasets would further amplify its impact on the research community."
