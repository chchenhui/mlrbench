    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description's focus on data-centric ML for foundation models, model-assisted dataset construction, multi-domain challenges, quality signals, and HCI aspects. It directly implements the core research idea of UMC, detailing the uncertainty estimation, clustering, bandit allocation, and iterative refinement loop. It also clearly builds upon and references the provided literature review, particularly the concepts from data-centric AI surveys (Zha et al. 2023, Xu et al. 2024) and addresses key challenges identified, such as curation efficiency, data quality, uncertainty, and exploration/exploitation balance."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, and significance are explicitly stated. The methodology is broken down into logical, sequential steps (1-7) with sufficient detail, including mathematical formulations for key components like uncertainty and UCB. The experimental design is thorough, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, ablations, and implementation parameters. Expected outcomes are quantified. The language is precise and the structure is easy to follow, making the research plan immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing techniques (ensemble uncertainty, clustering, multi-armed bandits, human-in-the-loop) into a cohesive pipeline (UMC) specifically designed for multi-domain foundation model curation. While individual components like uncertainty sampling or bandit-based active learning are known (as acknowledged by citing Gal et al. 2017, Hazan et al. 2016), their specific combination—using ensemble disagreement, clustering high-uncertainty samples for batching efficiency, and MAB allocation across these clusters to balance domain exploration and hard-sample exploitation—represents a novel and well-motivated approach in the context of large-scale, multi-domain data curation. It's a significant refinement over simpler methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages well-established theoretical foundations like ensemble methods for uncertainty, entropy/variance measures, K-means clustering, and UCB bandit algorithms. The methodology is technically well-described, and the mathematical formulations provided are correct. The experimental design is robust, featuring appropriate baselines, comprehensive metrics covering efficiency, performance, robustness, calibration, and domain coverage, along with planned ablations. Minor points, such as the specific choice of embedding fusion or the effectiveness of average cluster uncertainty as a bandit reward, might require empirical validation, but the overall approach is technically well-grounded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. It relies on standard ML components and infrastructure (deep learning models, clustering algorithms, GPUs). The iterative pipeline is complex but implementable with sufficient engineering effort. The specified scale (ensemble size, clusters, budget per round, model size) seems achievable with access to appropriate computational resources (like A100 GPUs mentioned) and human annotators. Potential challenges include managing annotation costs/logistics and tuning hyperparameters, but these appear manageable rather than fundamental roadblocks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the efficient creation of high-quality, diverse datasets for large-scale, multi-domain foundation models, which is a major bottleneck in AI development. The potential impact is substantial, including significant reductions in annotation cost (30-50% projected), improved model robustness against domain shift, broader domain coverage, and contributions to responsible AI practices through provenance tracking. Success would provide a valuable, scalable framework for the community (code release promised), directly advancing data-centric AI research and enabling better foundation models."
