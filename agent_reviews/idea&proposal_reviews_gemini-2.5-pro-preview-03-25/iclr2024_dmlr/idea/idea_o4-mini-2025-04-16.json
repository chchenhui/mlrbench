        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric ML for foundation models, specifically tackling 'Model-assisted dataset construction', 'Construction of datasets from large quantities of unlabeled/uncurated data', 'Quality signals for large-scale datasets', and 'Data curation and HCI'. It explicitly mentions the goal of improving data quality and diversity ('richer domain coverage') for 'multi-domain foundation models', including domains 'beyond' vision and language, which perfectly matches the workshop's scope and aims."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation (cost/difficulty of multi-domain dataset creation) is straightforward. The proposed UMC pipeline is described step-by-step (uncertainty scoring, routing, retraining, updating), and key components like ensemble models and the multi-armed bandit for exploration/exploitation are mentioned. While specific implementation details (e.g., exact model architectures, clustering algorithms, interface design) are omitted, the core concept and workflow are easily understandable with only minor ambiguities typical of a concise proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While core components like model-assisted curation, uncertainty sampling (confidence, disagreement), and iterative retraining are established concepts (often found in active learning literature), the specific application and synthesis for large-scale, multi-domain foundation model dataset construction is timely and relevant. The integration of an ensemble of domain specialists and a multi-armed bandit explicitly balancing domain exploration and hard-sample exploitation within this context adds a layer of innovation. It's less about groundbreaking new techniques and more about a thoughtful combination and application of existing methods to a pressing, large-scale problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology. Techniques for uncertainty estimation, model ensembling, data clustering, iterative training, and multi-armed bandits are well-known. Building an interactive curation interface is standard practice. The main challenges lie in the scale required for foundation models (significant compute resources for retraining, managing large data pools) and the effective integration of all components into a robust, efficient pipeline, including the human-in-the-loop aspect. Achieving the projected 30-50% cost reduction requires careful implementation and empirical validation, but the underlying technical steps are achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Creating high-quality, diverse datasets is a major bottleneck and cost driver in developing powerful foundation models. An effective method to reduce annotation costs while improving data quality and domain coverage, as proposed, would be a valuable contribution. It addresses a critical, practical problem ('accelerates high-quality, scalable dataset construction') directly relevant to advancing the capabilities and robustness of foundation models across various domains."
