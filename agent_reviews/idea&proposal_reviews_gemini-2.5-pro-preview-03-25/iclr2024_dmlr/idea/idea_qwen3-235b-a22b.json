        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key workshop topics, including 'Model-assisted dataset construction', 'Quality signals for large-scale datasets', 'Data curation', and 'Ethical considerations for and governance of large-scale datasets'. The focus on improving data quality for foundation models using the models themselves fits perfectly within the workshop's goal of highlighting advancements in data-centric approaches for large-scale models. While the examples focus on language/vision, the core concept is relevant to the broader theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The title is informative, the motivation clearly outlines the problem and need, and the main idea explains the proposed closed-loop mechanism, the role of the foundation model in generating quality signals, and the dynamic curation process concisely. Examples are provided to illustrate the concept, and the expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. There is minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using models for data selection exists (e.g., active learning), the concept of a fully integrated, closed-loop system where a foundation model autonomously refines its *own* training data *during* pre-training using self-generated quality signals is innovative. It proposes a dynamic, self-evolving dataset curation process tightly coupled with model training, offering a fresh perspective compared to static curation or post-hoc filtering."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building a stable closed-loop system that dynamically modifies large datasets during foundation model pre-training is complex. Ensuring the reliability and validity of self-generated quality signals without reinforcing biases or causing training instability requires careful design and validation. Efficiently implementing the dynamic reweighting/filtering at scale also poses engineering hurdles. Considerable research and engineering effort would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and increasingly difficult challenge of curating massive datasets for foundation models, tackling issues of noise, bias, and ethical risks at scale. Success could lead to major advancements in model robustness, trustworthiness, and efficiency, potentially reducing reliance on costly manual annotation and enabling the development of safer AI systems. The potential impact on the field is substantial."
