        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric approaches for foundation models in new domains (specifically scientific domains). It explicitly tackles several listed topics, including 'Construction of datasets from large quantities of unlabeled/uncurated data', 'Model-assisted dataset construction', 'Quality signals for large-scale datasets' (via uncertainty/relevance), and 'Data curation and HCI'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (model-assisted bootstrapping with human-in-the-loop verification), and goal are easy to understand. Key components like uncertainty quantification, relevance scoring, and HCI are mentioned. However, specific details about the initial model type, the exact uncertainty/relevance metrics, or the HCI design specifics are not elaborated, leaving minor ambiguities typical of a concise idea description."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While model-assisted data creation and human-in-the-loop systems exist, the proposed framework integrates these specifically for bootstrapping scientific datasets from literature/unstructured data using a foundation model, guided by quality-aware metrics (uncertainty/relevance), and iteratively refined with expert feedback. This specific combination and application to diverse scientific domains, moving beyond standard NLP/Vision tasks, offers a fresh perspective on dataset construction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It leverages existing concepts like foundation models, uncertainty quantification, and HCI principles. Access to scientific literature/data is often possible, though potentially challenging to parse. Key challenges include the computational resources needed for foundation models, the development effort for the integrated framework (including HCI), and securing sufficient domain expert time for verification, which can be a bottleneck. However, it doesn't rely on fundamentally unproven technologies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in applying powerful foundation models to scientific discovery â€“ the lack of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets. Successfully implementing this framework could dramatically accelerate data curation in various scientific fields, potentially leading to faster discoveries and advancements. It directly tackles the data-centric challenges highlighted by the workshop."
