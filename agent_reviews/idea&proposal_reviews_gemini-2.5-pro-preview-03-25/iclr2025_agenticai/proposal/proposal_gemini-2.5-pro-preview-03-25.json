    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses all four thrusts outlined in the workshop call, particularly Thrust 1 (multi-agent decomposition design, human-in-the-loop), Thrust 2 (game theory, validation, hallucination), Thrust 3 (domain adaptation, trustworthiness), and Thrust 4 (multi-agent collaboration, validation). The proposal meticulously elaborates on the core research idea, detailing the specific agents, KG structure, coordination mechanism, and evaluation plan. Furthermore, it explicitly references the provided literature (AstroAgents, VirSci, SciAgents, MATRL) and positions DecompAI within that context, aiming to tackle the key challenges identified (coordination, fine-tuning, cooperation/divergence balance, evaluation, human-AI collaboration)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research idea (DecompAI), objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The decomposition into specific agent roles (Explorer, Retriever, Reasoner, Validator) is easy to understand. The proposed workflow, KG function, and experimental design are detailed and unambiguous. The use of a conceptual utility function formula aids understanding of the game-theoretic approach. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor refinements might be needed for the exact implementation details of the utility functions during the research, but this is expected at the proposal stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While multi-agent systems for science (AstroAgents, VirSci, SciAgents) and the use of KGs exist, DecompAI's novelty lies in the specific combination of: 1) A structured decomposition into distinct functional agent roles tailored for hypothesis generation. 2) The central, dynamic role of the KG as a shared substrate for collaborative reasoning and traceability. 3) The explicit application of game theory (inspired by MARL like MATRL) to coordinate agents by *balancing* cooperative hypothesis building with constructive divergence (challenging assumptions, exploring alternatives). This focus on managing the cooperation-divergence trade-off via game theory for hypothesis generation appears distinct from the cited works and offers a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations (LLMs, agentic AI, KGs, game theory) and cites relevant prior work. The proposed methodology, including agent specialization via fine-tuning, KG for knowledge sharing, and tool use, is well-established practice. The decomposition strategy is logical. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, multiple evaluation metrics (including human expert assessment), and specific domains. The conceptual game-theoretic formulation is plausible. The main area requiring further rigorous development during the research is the precise formulation and validation of the utility functions and coordination mechanism to ensure they effectively guide agents towards generating high-quality hypotheses."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Required technologies (LLMs, agent frameworks, KGs) exist. However, the project is ambitious: 1) Curating high-quality, domain-specific data for fine-tuning multiple agents requires substantial effort. 2) Implementing and effectively tuning the game-theoretic coordination mechanism is complex and requires expertise in MARL/game theory. 3) Integrating multiple agents, a dynamic KG, and external tools into a robust system is non-trivial. 4) Significant computational resources are needed for fine-tuning and running the system. 5) Recruiting domain experts for evaluation requires coordination. While achievable for a well-resourced team, the complexity introduces moderate risks regarding timeline and achieving optimal performance."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of improving automated scientific hypothesis generation, moving beyond generic outputs towards novel, specialized, and testable ideas. Success would represent a major advancement in Agentic AI for Science, directly contributing to the workshop's goals. Potential impacts include accelerating discovery in chemistry, genetics, and potentially other fields; enhancing AI trustworthiness and transparency in science through traceable reasoning; providing novel insights into multi-agent coordination for complex tasks; and fostering more effective human-AI collaboration in research. The focus on validation and reducing hallucination is crucial for practical adoption."
