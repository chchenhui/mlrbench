        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on agentic AI for science, particularly Thrust 1 (Design and development of agentic AI systems) and Thrust 4 (Open problems like multi-agent collaboration and knowledge integration). It faithfully expands on the core research idea, detailing the multi-agent decomposition, specialized roles, dynamic knowledge graph, and game-theoretic coordination. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (AstroAgents, VirSci, SciAgents, MATRL), positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape and aiming to address the identified challenges like agent coordination, domain specialization, and evaluation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from introduction and motivation to detailed methodology, evaluation, and expected impact. Objectives are explicitly stated. Key components like agent roles, the Dynamic Knowledge Graph (DKG), and the game-theoretic coordination mechanism are explained clearly, including relevant mathematical formulations. The hypothesis generation pipeline is well-described. While intricate, the overall concept and plan are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While multi-agent systems for scientific discovery exist (as cited), DecompAI introduces a novel combination of elements: 1) A specific decomposition into five distinct agent roles (Explorer, Knowledge, Reasoning, Experiment, Critic) focused on the hypothesis lifecycle. 2) The integration of a *dynamic* knowledge graph as a central communication and evolving memory structure. 3) The explicit application of game-theoretic coordination (inspired by MATRL) to balance cooperation and creative divergence among agents in this specific context. 4) The strong emphasis on generating *testable* hypotheses via a dedicated Experiment Agent. This combination offers a fresh perspective distinct from prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (LLMs, multi-agent systems, knowledge graphs, game theory). The proposed methodology, including agent specialization through fine-tuning, the DKG for knowledge management, and game-theoretic coordination, is logical and well-justified. The inclusion of mathematical formulations for the loss function and coordination mechanism adds rigor. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, incorporating quantitative metrics, expert assessment, comparative analysis, and ablation studies. Minor weaknesses include the inherent complexity of tuning the game-theoretic aspects and ensuring robust DKG updates, but the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While leveraging existing technologies (LLMs, MARL), the integration of five specialized, fine-tuned agents, a dynamic knowledge graph, and a complex game-theoretic coordination mechanism is highly ambitious. It requires substantial computational resources for training and operation, access to high-quality domain-specific corpora, and significant engineering effort. The planned experimental validation in actual labs adds another layer of complexity, cost, and potential bottlenecks. While conceptually sound, successful execution faces considerable practical hurdles related to complexity and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical bottleneck of hypothesis generation and validation in scientific discovery, aiming to improve the quality, novelty, and testability of AI-generated hypotheses. By tackling limitations of current monolithic systems and focusing on transparency and experimental design, it has the potential to substantially accelerate scientific progress across diverse domains. The development of an open-source framework and benchmarks would be a major contribution. Success could lead to transformative changes in how scientific research is conducted, fostering better human-AI collaboration."
