        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses 'Thrust 1: Design and development of agentic AI systems for scientific discovery', specifically mentioning 'Multi-agent decomposition design' for 'scientific hypothesis generation'. It also touches upon related aspects like domain specialization (Thrust 1 & 3), validation (Thrust 1 & 4), knowledge graphs (mentioned in Thrust 1 examples), and human oversight (Thrust 1). The focus on hypothesis generation and validation is explicitly listed as a key focus area for the workshop."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, core concept (multi-agent decomposition with specific roles), interaction mechanism (shared KG, game theory), domain adaptation (fine-tuning), and evaluation plan are explicitly stated. The expected outcomes (improved quality, reduced hallucination, transparency) are also clearly articulated. It is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While multi-agent systems and their application to science (e.g., SciAgents mentioned in the task description) are existing areas, the specific proposed decomposition into domain exploration, knowledge retrieval, inferential reasoning, and experimental validation agents, coupled with game-theoretic interactions and domain-specific fine-tuning for hypothesis generation, offers a fresh perspective. It's an innovative combination and specialization of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current AI technology (LLMs, agent frameworks, knowledge graphs). However, implementation presents moderate challenges. Designing robust inter-agent communication, implementing effective game-theoretic utility functions, creating and maintaining a dynamic shared knowledge graph, and particularly developing a meaningful 'experimental validation' agent require significant effort. Access to domain-specific corpora for fine-tuning and robust evaluation benchmarks (potentially requiring human experts) are also necessary resources. It's ambitious but achievable within a dedicated research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Automating and improving scientific hypothesis generation is a critical challenge with the potential to dramatically accelerate research across various fields (chemistry and genetics are mentioned as examples). Addressing issues like focus, testability, novelty, and hallucination in AI-generated hypotheses would be a major advancement. Success could lead to faster discoveries, more efficient resource allocation in labs, and increased trust in AI tools for science, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of unlocking AI's transformative potential in research."
