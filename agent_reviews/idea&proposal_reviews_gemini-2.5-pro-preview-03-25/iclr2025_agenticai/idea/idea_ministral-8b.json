    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (workshop call). It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of 'Agentic AI for Science' focusing on hypothesis generation, comprehension, and validation. The five main components of the idea map almost perfectly onto the workshop's four research thrusts: 1) Design and Development (Foundation Model Adaptation, Multi-Agent Decomposition, Human-in-the-Loop), 2) Theoretical Foundations (Theoretical Foundations component), 3) Practical Applications (Practical Applications and Ethical Considerations component), and touches upon 4) Open Problems (multi-agent collaboration). It explicitly mentions key focus areas like AI-driven hypothesis generation/validation, reasoning, and ethical considerations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main idea broken into five components, expected outcomes, and potential impact are presented logically. Each component describes a distinct aspect of the proposed research. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific technical details within each component (e.g., the exact nature of communication protocols, the specific statistical models beyond naming reasoning types), but the overall vision and structure are well-defined and understandable for a research proposal at this stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. While individual components like adapting foundation models, using multi-agent systems (e.g., SciAgents mentioned in the task description), human-in-the-loop interfaces, theoretical validation, and ethical considerations are known research directions, the novelty lies in their proposed *integration* into a comprehensive multi-agent framework specifically designed for the end-to-end scientific discovery process (generation, comprehension, validation). It synthesizes current trends into a coherent system for scientific agentic AI, rather than introducing a single groundbreaking technique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building and fine-tuning multiple domain-specific foundation models requires substantial data and compute resources. Designing robust inter-agent communication and collaboration protocols is complex. Ensuring the scientific validity and reliability of AI-generated hypotheses, especially mitigating hallucination, is a major hurdle. Developing the proposed theoretical foundations is a research challenge in itself. While building on existing technologies (foundation models, multi-agent frameworks), realizing the full vision would require considerable effort, resources, and breakthroughs in AI reliability and reasoning. Initial prototypes focusing on specific aspects might be more immediately feasible."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully developing such a system could revolutionize scientific discovery by accelerating research cycles, automating hypothesis generation and initial validation, potentially uncovering novel insights humans might miss, and making the process more efficient. Addressing the reliability, interpretability, and ethical deployment of AI in science, as proposed, is critical for its adoption. The potential to transform scientific methodology across various fields gives this idea very high significance."
