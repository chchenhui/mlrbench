        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses multiple core themes and key topics outlined in the task description. It focuses explicitly on 'Explainable MFMs' (via saliency maps and concept activation vectors) and 'Patient Privacy'/'Security' (using federated learning, differential privacy, and secure aggregation). It also incorporates 'Multimodal Learning' (CT scans, lab results, clinical notes) and aims to develop 'MFMs at Scale' for diagnostics. Furthermore, the planned clinician trust studies touch upon 'Human-AI Interaction'. The motivation aligns perfectly with the task's emphasis on overcoming barriers like privacy and transparency to enable trustworthy AI in healthcare. It strongly matches the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly states the motivation, the core components (transformer, multimodal fusion, FL, DP, explainability module), the data types involved, and the evaluation strategy (accuracy, privacy metrics, user studies). The goal of delivering robust, private, and explainable diagnostics is well-defined. While specific architectural details or the exact implementation of the explanation module could be further elaborated, the overall concept and approach are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea integrates several existing techniques (federated learning, differential privacy, multimodal transformers, attention-based explainability) rather than proposing a fundamentally new algorithm. FL for medical data, multimodal models, and XAI methods are established research areas. The novelty lies primarily in the specific *combination* and *application* of these techniques to create a secure *and* explainable multimodal *foundation model* for healthcare, addressing these critical needs simultaneously within a single framework. It's a strong engineering and integration effort applied to a relevant problem, but not groundbreaking in terms of core methodology."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible as it builds upon existing technologies like transformers, FL frameworks, DP libraries, and XAI techniques. However, significant challenges exist. Accessing and coordinating multi-center datasets for FL is complex. Integrating FL, DP, secure aggregation, multimodal fusion, and explainability into one robust system requires substantial engineering effort. Achieving the ambitious target of ≥95% of centralized accuracy while maintaining strong differential privacy (ε≤1) is particularly challenging due to the inherent privacy-utility trade-off. Clinician user studies also require careful planning and resources. While feasible, implementation requires significant expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses critical and timely challenges hindering the adoption of advanced AI in healthcare: data privacy and lack of transparency. By proposing a solution that tackles both security (via FL/DP) and explainability, it directly contributes to building trustworthy medical AI, which is a core goal mentioned in the task description. Success would represent a major step towards deploying powerful foundation models in sensitive clinical settings, potentially improving diagnostic access and quality, especially in underserved areas. The focus on clinician trust further enhances its practical significance."
