        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for research on 'Explainable MFMs' to open the black box and ensure transparency and interpretability, which is the core focus of the 'Causal-MFM' proposal. It directly addresses the need for trustworthy and reliable MFMs in healthcare, a central theme of the workshop. Furthermore, it touches upon related topics mentioned in the task, such as multimodal learning (using images, text, sensors) and potentially robustness (aiming for robustness against covariate shifts)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (need for causal explanations beyond correlations), the main components (causal discovery, causal explanation module), and the evaluation strategy (clinician validation, specific tasks) are well-defined. The concept of using causal reasoning for MFM explainability is clearly presented. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific algorithms for causal discovery from multimodal data and the precise mechanism for embedding the causal module within the MFM architecture, but these are acceptable details for a research idea stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While explainability (XAI) and causal inference are established fields, applying causal reasoning specifically to generate explanations for large-scale Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) is a relatively new and promising direction. It moves beyond standard correlation-based XAI methods (like attention maps) often used with deep models, proposing a deeper, causality-based understanding tailored to the high-stakes medical domain. The integration of causal discovery from multimodal data directly into the MFM framework for generating action-aware explanations represents a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Robust causal discovery from complex, high-dimensional, and potentially noisy multimodal medical data is inherently difficult and often requires strong assumptions or extensive domain knowledge. Integrating learned causal structures effectively within the architecture of large foundation models is technically challenging. Access to suitable multimodal medical datasets and meaningful collaboration with clinicians for validation, while planned, can also pose practical hurdles. Significant research effort and expertise in both causality and deep learning would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the 'black-box' nature of MFMs is critical for their adoption in clinical practice. Providing causal explanations, rather than just correlational ones, could substantially increase clinician trust, facilitate safer decision-making, and meet emerging regulatory requirements for AI transparency. If successful, this research could lead to major advancements in trustworthy AI for healthcare, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and ultimately patient outcomes by making AI insights more understandable and actionable for medical professionals."
