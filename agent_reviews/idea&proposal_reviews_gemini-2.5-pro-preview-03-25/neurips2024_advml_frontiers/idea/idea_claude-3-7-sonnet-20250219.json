    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses several key topics listed for the AdvML-Frontiers'24 workshop, including 'Adversarial threats on LMMs', 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs', and 'Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs'. The focus on strengthening LMMs against cross-modal attacks fits squarely within the workshop's theme of exploring the intersection of AdvML and LMMs, specifically the 'AdvML for LMMs' category."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the main idea is broken down into a comprehensible three-pronged strategy (consistency verification, modality-bridging training, adaptive robustness). However, the specific mechanisms for each prong (e.g., how consistency is verified, how bridging perturbations are generated, how the adaptive mechanism works) are not detailed, leaving some ambiguity about the precise implementation. Minor refinements with more technical detail would improve clarity further."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial training and consistency checks exist, the proposed framework integrates these concepts specifically for cross-modal defense in LMMs. The combination of a dedicated cross-modal consistency verification module, adversarial training explicitly targeting modality-bridging vulnerabilities, and an adaptive defense mechanism presents a fresh perspective on defending LMMs. It moves beyond single-modality defenses and offers a potentially innovative, integrated approach to a complex problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible with current technology and AdvML techniques. Implementing consistency checks, generating targeted adversarial examples, and developing adaptive systems are all within the realm of current ML research. However, integrating these components effectively within complex LMM architectures, ensuring the 'minimal modifications' claim holds true, and developing a truly effective adaptive mechanism might pose moderate research and engineering challenges. It requires significant effort but seems achievable within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Cross-modal vulnerabilities represent a critical security risk for LMMs deployed in sensitive applications like autonomous driving or medical diagnosis. Developing effective defenses against such attacks is crucial for building trust and ensuring the safe deployment of these powerful models. This research directly addresses a major, timely challenge in the field, and a successful outcome could lead to substantial advancements in LMM robustness and security."
