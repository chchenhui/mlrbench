        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (AdvML-Frontiers'24 workshop). It directly addresses several key topics listed, including 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs', 'Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs', and 'LMM-aided AdvML (e.g., for attack and defense enhancements)'. The focus on using LMMs to improve the robustness of other multimodal models against cross-modal perturbations fits squarely within the workshop's theme of the intersection between AdvML and LMMs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, the proposed three-step framework (Adversarial Generation, Reinforced Selection, Adversarial Training), and the expected outcomes are well-defined. The core concept of using an LMM to generate hard negatives for training is understandable. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise implementation details, such as the exact prompting techniques for 'minimal' edits or the specific architecture of the reward model, but the overall research direction is clearly presented."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial example generation and hard negative mining are established concepts, the proposed approach of leveraging a large multimodal model (LMM) specifically to synthesize *cross-modal* hard negatives (subtle semantic/visual edits causing misalignment) within a closed-loop, reinforcement-guided framework for adversarial training is innovative. It represents a fresh combination of LMM capabilities, adversarial learning, and reinforcement learning applied to enhance cross-modal robustness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires access to capable LMMs for generation, the ability to fine-tune a target multimodal classifier, and resources to train a reward model and run the closed-loop process. Controlling the LMM to generate 'minimal' yet effective perturbations might require careful prompt engineering and experimentation. While computationally intensive, the components exist, making it feasible, though requiring significant engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Enhancing the robustness of LMMs against cross-modal perturbations is a critical challenge for their reliable deployment. Automating the generation of diverse and semantically challenging hard negatives could lead to substantially more robust models than standard adversarial training methods allow. Success in this area would represent a major advancement in adversarial defense for multimodal AI and could establish a new paradigm for data augmentation in this domain."
