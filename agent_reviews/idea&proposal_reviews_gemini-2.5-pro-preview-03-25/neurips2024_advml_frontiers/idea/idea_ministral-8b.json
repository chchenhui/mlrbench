    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (AdvML-Frontiers'24 workshop). The task explicitly calls for research at the intersection of Adversarial Machine Learning (AdvML) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), focusing on topics like 'Adversarial threats on LMMs', 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs', and 'Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs'. The idea directly addresses these core topics by proposing cross-modal adversarial training, specific cross-modal defense mechanisms, and evaluation metrics for LMM robustness, fitting squarely into the 'AdvML for LMMs' category mentioned."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main idea, methodology (broken down into three distinct steps: cross-modal adversarial training, multimodal defense mechanisms, evaluation metrics), expected outcomes, and potential impact are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The specific examples of defense mechanisms (watermarking, noise injection) further clarify the proposed approach."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While adversarial training and defense mechanisms like watermarking or noise injection are known concepts, their specific application in a *cross-modal* context to defend LMMs is a relatively underexplored area. Proposing cross-modal adversarial training tailored for LMMs, designing defenses that explicitly leverage or protect against cross-modal interactions, and developing new metrics for this specific scenario offer notable innovation beyond standard single-modality adversarial robustness research. It builds upon existing work but combines and extends it in a novel direction relevant to LMMs."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate challenges. Implementing cross-modal adversarial training and testing defenses requires access to LMMs and significant computational resources, which can be demanding. Generating effective cross-modal adversarial examples and designing novel cross-modal defense mechanisms requires specialized expertise. However, the core techniques (adversarial training, watermarking, noise injection) have precedents, and suitable LMMs and datasets are increasingly available. The research plan doesn't rely on unproven theoretical breakthroughs, making it achievable within a well-resourced research environment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. LMMs are rapidly gaining importance, and their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, particularly complex cross-modal attacks, is a critical security concern. Enhancing the adversarial robustness of LMMs through dedicated cross-modal defenses directly addresses this important problem. Success in this research could lead to more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems, contributing meaningfully to the field of AI security and AdvML."
