        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses key topics listed for the AdvML-Frontiers'24 workshop, specifically 'Adversarial threats on LMMs', 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs', and 'Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs'. The focus on enhancing LMM robustness against cross-modal attacks using a novel adversarial training framework fits squarely within the workshop's theme of exploring the intersection of AdvML and LMMs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation explicitly states the problem of cross-modal vulnerabilities in LMMs. The proposed method, Cross-Modal Gradient Alignment (CMGA), is described through its core components (generating cross-modal perturbations, aligning gradients, integrating contrastive learning). The evaluation plan and expected outcomes are also clearly stated. While the precise mathematical formulation of 'gradient alignment' isn't detailed, the overall concept and approach are immediately understandable and articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial training is an established field, applying it specifically to mitigate *cross-modal* vulnerabilities in LMMs by explicitly aligning gradients *across* modalities during training appears innovative. Standard defenses often focus on single modalities or generic robustness. The proposed CMGA method, particularly the concept of synchronizing gradients derived from cross-modal attack vectors and combining it with contrastive learning to disentangle patterns, offers a fresh perspective on robust multimodal learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Accessing and fine-tuning large LMMs like CLIP or GPT-4V variants is possible but computationally intensive. Generating cross-modal adversarial examples and calculating gradients across modalities are technically achievable with current deep learning frameworks. However, implementing the proposed 'gradient alignment' mechanism effectively and efficiently, especially at scale, might require significant engineering effort and computational resources. The evaluation on standard benchmarks is practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. As LMMs are increasingly deployed, their robustness against adversarial attacks, particularly complex cross-modal ones, is critical for safety and reliability. This research addresses a specific, important, and relatively under-explored vulnerability. Developing effective defenses like the proposed CMGA could lead to major advancements in securing LMMs, fostering trust, and enabling safer deployment in real-world applications. It also contributes to the fundamental understanding of adversarial phenomena in multimodal systems."
