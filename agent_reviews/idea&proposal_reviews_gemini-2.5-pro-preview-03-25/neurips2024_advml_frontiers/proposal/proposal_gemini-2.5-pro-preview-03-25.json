    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the AdvML-Frontiers workshop task, such as 'Adversarial threats on LMMs', 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs', and 'Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs'. The proposed CMAI framework perfectly matches the research idea, elaborating on the three key components (CMCV, MBAT, ARM). It effectively synthesizes concepts discussed in the literature review (cross-modal attacks, consistency training, adaptive defense, adversarial training) and positions itself relative to existing work, aiming to provide a more integrated solution. The objectives and significance sections explicitly connect the research to the identified gaps and task requirements."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Key concepts like CMAI, CMCV, MBAT, and ARM are defined, and the methodology includes specific mathematical formulations and a well-outlined experimental plan. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise architecture choice for CMCV (presented as alternatives) and the concrete implementation details of the ARM's inference-time adaptation. However, these do not significantly impede the overall understanding of the proposed research. The language is generally precise and technical."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing concepts mentioned in the literature review (consistency verification [6], cross-modal adversarial training [8], adaptive defense [7]), the novelty lies in the proposed integration of these three elements into a single, cohesive framework (CMAI). Specifically, the Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training (MBAT) objective, which explicitly aims to maximize cross-modal inconsistency using the CMCV score during attack generation, appears novel. Furthermore, the Adaptive Robustness Mechanism (ARM) that leverages the CMCV output to dynamically adjust both training and inference processes represents a sophisticated integration distinct from prior work focusing on individual components. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from single-modality defenses or defenses targeting specific attacks like jailbreaking [1]."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established AdvML principles like adversarial training (PGD-AT) and leverages relevant concepts like contrastive learning and consistency metrics. The mathematical formulations for CMCV and MBAT are clearly presented and appear technically correct. The proposed methodology, including the training procedure and the comprehensive experimental design (baselines, diverse attacks including adaptive ones, ablation studies, relevant metrics), is robust and well-justified. A minor weakness is the reliance on several placeholder references ([5-10]), which slightly obscures the specific grounding in concrete prior work, although the concepts represented by these placeholders are relevant and sound within the field. Assuming these represent valid concepts from the literature, the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. It relies on standard LMM architectures, publicly available datasets, and established deep learning techniques. The primary requirements are significant computational resources (common for LMM research, especially involving adversarial training) and substantial engineering effort for implementing and integrating the CMAI components (CMCV, MBAT, ARM) and tuning hyperparameters. While challenges exist in optimizing the MBAT process and ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the CMCV and ARM components, these appear to be manageable research and engineering challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks. The plan is generally realistic."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the vulnerability of increasingly prevalent LMMs to cross-modal adversarial attacks. Enhancing robustness in this area is crucial for the safe deployment of LMMs in high-stakes applications (autonomous systems, healthcare, security). The proposed integrated CMAI framework has the potential to offer a more comprehensive and fundamental defense compared to existing approaches, leading to meaningful advancements in AdvML for multimodal systems. Success would contribute to more trustworthy AI, mitigate risks of malicious exploitation, and advance the scientific understanding of cross-modal vulnerabilities and defenses, aligning perfectly with the goals of the AdvML-Frontiers workshop."
