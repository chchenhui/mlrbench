        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core focus of the AdvML-Frontiers workshop task: cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities and defensive strategies for LMMs. The methodology precisely implements the three-pronged strategy outlined in the research idea (consistency verification, modality-bridging adversarial training, adaptive mechanism). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, acknowledging prior work (ProEAT, CrossFire, consistency training, adaptive defenses) while clearly positioning its unique contribution as a unified framework addressing identified gaps and challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected impact. Research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section meticulously breaks down each component (CMCVM, MBAT, ARM) with clear architectural descriptions, mathematical formulations, and training procedures. The experimental design is comprehensive and easy to follow. The language is precise and technical, leaving little room for ambiguity. While minor details like hyperparameter selection strategies or specifics of the custom dataset could be elaborated further, the overall clarity is outstanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components draw inspiration from existing concepts mentioned in the literature review (consistency verification - White et al., adversarial training targeting specific points - Lu et al., Red et al., adaptive defenses - Black et al.), the primary novelty lies in the proposed *unified framework* (CMAI) that integrates these three elements specifically for *general* cross-modal defense in LMMs. The modality-bridging adversarial training (MBAT) formulation targeting cross-modal transfer points with a combined consistency and KL divergence loss, and the adaptive robustness mechanism (ARM) that dynamically links consistency detection (CMCVM) to adjustments in training (MBAT) and verification, represent a fresh approach. It's not groundbreaking in inventing entirely new techniques but offers a novel synthesis and adaptation tailored to the cross-modal challenge."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations within adversarial machine learning, utilizing established techniques like PGD for attack generation, cosine similarity and contrastive loss for consistency, projection networks for embedding mapping, and adaptive mechanisms with EMA smoothing. The mathematical formulations for the CMCVM, MBAT, and ARM components are clearly presented and appear technically correct. The methodology is well-justified, logically structured, and directly addresses the research objectives. The proposed integration of components into a unified loss function is standard practice. The approach is well-grounded in the cited literature and tackles the identified challenges systematically."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The methodology relies on standard ML techniques and largely publicly available datasets and open-source models (LLaVA, CLIP, BLIP-2, ImageBind). However, implementing and integrating the three components (CMCVM, MBAT, ARM) requires significant engineering effort. Training/fine-tuning large LMMs, especially with adversarial examples (MBAT), is computationally intensive and costly, potentially requiring substantial GPU resources. Accessing and experimenting with proprietary models like GPT-4V might pose challenges (API costs, limitations). Creating the custom 'Multi-Avengers' dataset requires additional effort. The overall scope (multiple components, models, datasets, attacks) is ambitious for a typical project timeline, potentially requiring careful phasing or scoping. Despite these challenges, the core research plan is implementable with adequate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the security of LMMs against cross-modal adversarial attacks, a key topic highlighted in the task description. As LMMs are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications (autonomous systems, healthcare, finance), ensuring their robustness across modalities is paramount. A successful CMAI framework would represent a major advancement in LMM security, offering practical benefits for real-world systems. Theoretically, it would deepen the understanding of cross-modal representations and vulnerabilities. The potential contributions to safer, more reliable, and trustworthy AI are substantial and clearly articulated, aligning perfectly with the goals of advancing AdvML for LMMs."
