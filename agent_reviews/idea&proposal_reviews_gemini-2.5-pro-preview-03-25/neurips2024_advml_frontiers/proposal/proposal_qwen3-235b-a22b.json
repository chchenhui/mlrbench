    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the AdvML-Frontiers workshop task, such as 'Adversarial threats on LMMs', 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs', and 'Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs'. The methodology clearly elaborates on the three-pronged strategy outlined in the research idea (consistency verification, modality-bridging AT, adaptive robustness). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, referencing specific works like ProEAT, CrossFire, and papers on adaptive defense and cross-modal AT, positioning itself as an advancement over existing methods while addressing key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context effectively, the research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section breaks down the proposed CMAI framework into understandable components (Consistency Verification, Modality-Bridging AT, Adaptive Controller). Formulas and high-level algorithms are provided. The experimental design and expected outcomes are also clearly outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism of the 'robust fusion module' (F_{\\\\text{robust}}) activated during inference or the exact implementation details of the online weight updates for the adaptive controller, but overall the proposal is well-articulated and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating three distinct techniques (cross-modal consistency verification, modality-bridging adversarial training specifically targeting integration points, and an adaptive robustness mechanism) into a unified framework (CMAI) for defending LMMs against cross-modal attacks. While individual components draw inspiration from existing work (e.g., consistency checks, adversarial training, adaptive defense concepts cited in the literature review), their specific combination and application to dynamically defend against cross-modal vulnerabilities in LMMs, particularly the adaptive controller adjusting based on attack patterns, offers a fresh perspective. It distinguishes itself from cited baselines like ProEAT and standard Cross-Modal AT by incorporating the consistency check and the adaptive layer explicitly for cross-modal defense."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established principles in adversarial ML, such as PGD-based adversarial training, cosine similarity for representation alignment, and contrastive loss functions. The formulation of the modality-bridging attack generation and the combined training objective appears logical. The use of a consistency classifier is a reasonable approach. The adaptive controller, while based on a plausible heuristic (using ASR and gradient norms), requires empirical validation for its effectiveness, as theoretical guarantees might be limited. The technical formulations presented are generally correct and clearly presented. The overall methodology is well-grounded in existing research, providing a solid foundation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods but presents some challenges. It requires significant computational resources, especially for adversarial training on large LMMs (10B-100B parameters), although the proposed use of PEFT (LoRA) is a standard and reasonable mitigation strategy. Access to relevant multimodal datasets is necessary. The implementation complexity lies in integrating the three modules effectively, tuning hyperparameters (e.g., \\\\lambda, \\\\tau, \\\\gamma, adaptation rates), and ensuring the adaptive controller functions as intended. Generating effective cross-modal adversarial examples for training can also be non-trivial. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable with adequate resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely vulnerability (cross-modal adversarial attacks) in LMMs, which poses substantial risks in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and medical diagnostics, as highlighted in the proposal. Developing effective defenses like CMAI could significantly enhance the security and trustworthiness of deployed LMMs. The research also has the potential to advance AdvML theory by formalizing cross-modal robustness and exploring adaptive defense strategies in this context. The plan to release datasets and tools further enhances its potential impact on the research community."
