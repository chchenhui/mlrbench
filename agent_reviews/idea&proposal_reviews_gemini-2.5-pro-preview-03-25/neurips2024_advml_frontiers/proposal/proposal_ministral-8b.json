    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on AdvML for LMMs, specifically cross-modal vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. The objectives and methodology perfectly reflect the research idea (consistency verification, modality-bridging AT, adaptive robustness). Furthermore, the proposal explicitly aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as cross-modal vulnerabilities and the need for adaptive defenses, grounding its approach in recent work (e.g., papers 6, 7, 8 on consistency, adaptation, and cross-modal AT)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology (three main components), datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics are clearly defined. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist in the precise technical implementation details, such as the exact mechanism for targeting 'cross-modal integration points' during adversarial training and the specific state/action space definition for the reinforcement learning-based adaptive mechanism. However, these do not significantly obscure the overall research direction."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. It integrates three distinct concepts: cross-modal consistency verification, modality-bridging adversarial training, and an adaptive defense mechanism using reinforcement learning. While the literature review indicates prior work on similar individual components (e.g., paper 6 on consistency/bridging AT, paper 7 on adaptive defense, paper 8 on cross-modal AT), the novelty lies in the specific combination and integration of these three elements into a unified 'Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization' framework, particularly the application of RL for dynamic adaptation in this context. It's more of a synthesis and extension of recent ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound but has some gaps in rigor. It builds on established concepts (adversarial training, consistency loss, RL). The proposed consistency loss (L2 distance) and combined training objective are plausible starting points. However, the technical details lack depth. The mechanism for specifically targeting 'cross-modal integration points' needs more elaboration beyond standard adversarial training. The RL component lacks crucial details like the definition of state and action spaces, and the justification for why RL is the appropriate tool and how it will be trained effectively in this complex setting. The technical formulations provided are correct but basic."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Using standard datasets and existing LMMs is practical. However, implementing modality-bridging adversarial training specifically targeting integration points effectively can be complex and computationally expensive. The most challenging aspect is the adaptive robustness mechanism using reinforcement learning. Defining, implementing, and training an RL agent to dynamically adjust defenses for an LMM based on detected attack patterns is non-trivial, requiring substantial engineering effort and potentially facing issues with stability, convergence, and computational overhead. The proposal might underestimate these complexities."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the vulnerability of increasingly prevalent LMMs to cross-modal adversarial attacks. Enhancing robustness in this area is crucial for the safe deployment of LMMs in high-stakes applications (autonomous systems, healthcare, etc.). The research directly tackles key themes from the task description (AdvML for LMMs, cross-modal defense). If successful, the proposed framework could offer substantial improvements in LMM security and reliability, making a valuable contribution to the field."
