        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on AdvML for LMMs, specifically cross-modal vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. The proposal faithfully implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea (consistency verification, modality-bridging AT, adaptive mechanism). It positions itself clearly within the context of the provided literature, citing relevant works (e.g., ProEAT, CrossFire, consistency training) and aiming to tackle the key challenges identified (cross-modal vulnerabilities, performance preservation, adaptive defense). All components work together coherently towards the stated goal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the overall structure (Introduction, Methodology, Outcomes, Conclusion) is logical. The methodology sections detail the three core components with mathematical formulations for the consistency loss and adversarial training objective. The experimental design is comprehensive, outlining datasets, baselines, models, attacks, and metrics. Minor areas could benefit from refinement, such as providing more specific details on the architecture or training process for the adaptive robustness mechanism (beyond stating it uses RL) and explicitly highlighting the distinctions from seemingly similar cited works (e.g., [6], [7], [8]). However, the core ideas and plan are understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory originality. Its main novelty lies in the specific *integration* of three components: cross-modal consistency verification, modality-bridging adversarial training, and an RL-based adaptive robustness mechanism into a unified framework (CMAI). While the literature review suggests prior work exists on consistency training [6], adaptive defenses [7], and cross-modal adversarial training [8], the proposal combines these elements with specific formulations (e.g., the combined loss function, the RL-based dynamic weighting). The adaptive mechanism, particularly its proposed RL-based implementation for dynamically weighting loss components based on attack patterns, adds a layer of innovation. However, it's more of a novel synthesis and refinement of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established principles like adversarial training, consistency regularization (cosine similarity, KL divergence), and adaptive mechanisms using neural networks and reinforcement learning. The mathematical formulations provided for the consistency loss and the adversarial training objective are appropriate and clearly presented. The experimental design includes relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Minor gaps exist, such as the lack of detail regarding the specific RL algorithm, state/action space, and reward function for the adaptive mechanism, which is crucial for its success. The overall approach is technically plausible, but the complexity of jointly optimizing the LMM, adversarial perturbations, and the adaptive RL agent might pose stability challenges not fully addressed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Access to standard multimodal datasets and attack implementations (CrossFire, I2V) is realistic. Implementing the consistency loss and adversarial training components is achievable using standard ML frameworks. However, training large multimodal models is computationally expensive, and adding adversarial training and an RL component significantly increases this cost, requiring substantial GPU resources. Tuning the various hyperparameters (\\lambda, \\alpha, RL parameters) and ensuring the convergence and stability of the combined training process will require significant effort and expertise. The overall plan is generally realistic, but resource constraints and tuning complexity are manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the vulnerability of LMMs to cross-modal adversarial attacks. As LMMs are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains like autonomous driving and healthcare (as mentioned in the proposal), ensuring their robustness is paramount. Successfully developing the CMAI framework could lead to major advancements in LMM security and reliability. The potential contributions, including improved robustness against sophisticated attacks and the open-source release of code/datasets, would be substantial for both practical applications and the research community. It directly tackles ethical concerns regarding the malicious use of AI."
