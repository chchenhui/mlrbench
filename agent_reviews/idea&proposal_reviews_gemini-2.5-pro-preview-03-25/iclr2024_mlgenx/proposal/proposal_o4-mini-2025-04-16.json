    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key themes from the task description such as causal representation learning, perturbation biology, integrating multimodal readouts, active learning, uncertainty quantification, and experimental design for genomics. It faithfully elaborates on the core concepts outlined in the research idea (SVAE for latent causal structure, active learning for experiment design, multi-omics integration). Furthermore, it effectively synthesizes recent advancements highlighted in the literature review, positioning the work within the current research landscape and explicitly aiming to tackle the identified challenges (dimensionality, multimodality, interpretability, efficiency, uncertainty)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, and the overall structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes) is logical. The methodology section provides good detail, including mathematical formulations for the SVAE, Bayesian posterior approximation, and the active learning criterion (EIG). The algorithmic steps and evaluation plan are clearly outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mapping between the latent space 'z' and modality-specific decoders, but these do not significantly hinder understanding. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and largely unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced techniques (Structured VAEs with causal priors, Bayesian inference over graph structures, active learning via EIG) into a unified framework specifically designed for multi-omics perturbation data in genomics. While individual components draw from existing literature (as evidenced by the review), their synergistic combination to actively guide perturbation experiments based on latent causal representations learned from multi-omics data appears novel. The specific use of the ELBO-approximated graph posterior within the EIG calculation for this application context contributes to the novelty. It represents a fresh approach compared to applying these techniques in isolation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations in VAEs, Bayesian inference, causal graphical models, and active learning. The proposed methodology, including the SVAE formulation, the use of ELBO for graph scoring, and EIG for experiment selection, is technically plausible. The assumption of linear SEMs in the latent space is a simplification for interpretability but is acknowledged. The approximation of the graph posterior using the ELBO is a potential weakness but a common practice in variational inference. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including synthetic/real data, ablations, and uncertainty checks, indicating methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Computationally, the Bayesian graph search/scoring and the EIG estimation (requiring Monte Carlo sampling over graphs and data) will be intensive, likely requiring significant GPU resources as mentioned. Accessing and integrating diverse real-world multi-omics perturbation datasets (especially spatial) might require specific collaborations or data use agreements. The 'wet lab' step (2c) implies an experimental component; if this involves generating substantial new perturbation data within the project scope, feasibility heavily depends on unstated resources and timelines. However, developing and validating the computational framework using existing datasets (LINCS, public CRISPR screens) and simulations is definitely feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in drug discovery and genomics: the inefficient and often non-causal nature of target identification from high-throughput screens. By aiming to improve the efficiency of perturbation experiments (claiming 30-50% reduction) and providing interpretable causal models with uncertainty quantification, the work has the potential for major impact. Success would accelerate drug target validation, reduce experimental costs, and contribute to a more principled, hypothesis-driven approach in genomics research, aligning perfectly with the goals stated in the task description."
