        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on ML for genomics, target identification, causal representation learning, perturbation biology, multi-omics integration, active learning, and uncertainty quantification. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the proposed methods (SVAE, counterfactuals, active learning, uncertainty). Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and builds upon concepts from the provided literature (sparse mechanism shift, multi-omics VAEs, active learning for causal discovery, uncertainty quantification) and explicitly acknowledges the key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to detailed methodology and expected impact. Research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section clearly outlines the four main components (Representation Learning, Causal Discovery, Active Learning, Uncertainty Quantification) with appropriate technical detail and mathematical formulations for a proposal stage. The experimental validation plan is also clearly described. While inherently complex, the concepts are articulated well, making the proposal highly understandable. A minor point is the reference to a Figure 1 which is not included, but this doesn't significantly detract from overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like VAEs for multi-omics, score-based causal discovery, active learning, and Bayesian uncertainty quantification exist in the literature (as evidenced by the review), the key novelty lies in their sophisticated *integration* into a unified, iterative framework (ACTIVE-CMAP) specifically designed for guiding multi-omics perturbation experiments. The combination of structured latent variable modeling, causal discovery in this latent space informed by interventions, and active learning to select optimal perturbations based on causal uncertainty is a fresh approach in perturbation biology. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by proposing this specific end-to-end active learning cycle."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations (VAEs, causal graphical models, information theory, Bayesian inference). The chosen methods (SVAE, sparse mechanism shift, score-based causal discovery with DAG constraints, EIG for active learning, VI for uncertainty) are appropriate for the problem. The mathematical formulations presented are correct and clearly described. The proposal acknowledges potential issues like model identifiability in the latent space, which is crucial. Minor weaknesses include the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing that the learned latent variables perfectly capture the true underlying causal factors and the potential complexity of accurately approximating the EIG, but the overall methodological approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Accessing and processing suitable multi-omics perturbation datasets (like LINCS, Perturb-seq) is feasible but requires effort. The computational complexity of training the SVAE, performing causal discovery, and especially running the active learning loop with EIG estimation will be substantial, requiring significant computational resources (GPU clusters). Integrating all components into a robust software framework is non-trivial. The most challenging aspect regarding feasibility is the prospective experimental validation loop mentioned, which requires potentially costly and time-consuming wet-lab experiments and likely depends on strong collaborations. While the computational parts are feasible with expertise and resources, the full experimental cycle adds a layer of complexity and dependency."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in drug discovery â€“ the lack of causal understanding of disease mechanisms from complex biological data. By aiming to infer causal relationships from multi-omics perturbation data and actively guiding experiments, it has the potential to significantly accelerate the identification and validation of drug targets, potentially reducing the high failure rates in clinical trials. The integration of multi-omics data, causality, and active learning directly tackles major challenges highlighted in the task description and literature. Successful execution could lead to major advancements in systems biology, computational biology methodology, and translational medicine."
