        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the challenge and goal of building 'Foundation models for graphs and relational data', a key topic listed for the GLFrontiers workshop. It focuses on dynamic graphs, a ubiquitous data type where current foundation models struggle, thus pushing the 'new frontiers'. The motivation explicitly mentions the limitations of existing GNNs and Transformers, aligning with the workshop's context of evolving model architectures."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (need for dynamic graph models), the core proposal (self-attention, temporal embeddings, temporal graph tokens, dual-attention, contrastive pre-training), and the objective (foundation model for dynamic graphs) are well-defined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise architectural details of the dual-attention mechanism or the exact formulation of the temporal tokens, but the overall concept is readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While temporal graph networks and graph transformers exist, the proposal integrates these concepts specifically for building a *foundation model* for dynamic graphs. The introduction of 'temporal graph tokens', a dual spatial-temporal attention mechanism tailored for this, and a contrastive pre-training objective focused on predicting future graph states collectively represent a novel approach distinct from standard methods. It aims for generalizability and zero-shot capabilities, pushing beyond typical task-specific dynamic graph models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology. Self-attention, temporal embeddings, and contrastive learning are established techniques. The components can be implemented. However, creating a true 'foundation model' implies training on very large-scale, diverse dynamic graph datasets, which poses significant challenges in terms of data availability/curation and computational resources (memory, compute time for processing long temporal sequences and large graphs). While the core mechanisms are feasible, achieving the envisioned scale requires substantial effort and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Dynamic graphs are prevalent in critical domains (finance, social networks, biology, infrastructure), and effectively modeling their evolution is a major open challenge. A successful foundation model for dynamic graphs would represent a substantial advancement, enabling breakthroughs in understanding and predicting complex evolving systems. It directly addresses a key limitation in current graph learning and has the potential for broad scientific and industrial impact, aligning with the workshop's goal of expanding graph learning's reach."
