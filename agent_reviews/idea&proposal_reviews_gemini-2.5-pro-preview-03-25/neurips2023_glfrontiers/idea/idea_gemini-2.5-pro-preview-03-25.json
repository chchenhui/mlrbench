        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for submissions on 'Graph/Knowledge enhanced LLMs', including 'using structured knowledge to enhance the capability of LLMs in returning factual... answers', 'Knowledge-enhanced LLMs', and 'improved LLMs reasoning'. The proposed idea directly addresses this by using a Knowledge Graph (KG) in an iterative loop with an LLM to improve factuality and reasoning through verifiable steps grounded in the KG structure. It fits squarely within the workshop's focus on the future of graph learning in the era of foundation models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (LLM factuality issues), the core mechanism (iterative LLM-KG interaction loop), and the goal (improved factuality, verifiable reasoning) are clearly explained. The concept of translating LLM steps into graph operations and using feedback is understandable. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise mechanism for translating LLM reasoning steps into specific graph operations (e.g., query language, type of operations) and how inconsistencies are handled, but the overall framework is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers notable originality. While using KGs to augment LLMs (RAG, knowledge injection) and iterative reasoning frameworks exist, the proposed approach of having the LLM generate reasoning steps that are *translated into explicit graph operations* for verification/guidance within a feedback loop seems novel. It goes beyond simple fact retrieval by attempting to leverage the KG's relational structure actively to guide and validate the LLM's step-by-step reasoning process. This specific mechanism for structured, verifiable reasoning guidance distinguishes it from standard RAG or simpler KG-prompting techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Core components like LLMs and KGs are available. Executing graph operations is standard. The main challenge lies in the robust translation of potentially ambiguous natural language reasoning steps generated by the LLM into precise, executable graph operations (e.g., SPARQL queries, pathfinding algorithms). This NL-to-GraphQuery translation is a non-trivial research problem itself. Managing the iterative process is feasible with current agent frameworks, but the reliability of the translation component could significantly impact overall system performance. Requires considerable engineering and potentially further research on the translation module."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Addressing LLM factuality, hallucination, and complex reasoning limitations is a critical research area. Grounding LLM reasoning in structured, verifiable knowledge from KGs could lead to more trustworthy and reliable AI systems. Success in this area would represent a meaningful contribution, particularly for knowledge-intensive domains requiring high accuracy and verifiable reasoning chains (e.g., science, medicine, finance). It directly tackles a major weakness of current LLMs."
