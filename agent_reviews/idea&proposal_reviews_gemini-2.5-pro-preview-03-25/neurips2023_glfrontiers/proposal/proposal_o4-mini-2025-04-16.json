    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for 'Foundation models for graphs and relational data' and 'interacting with structural data with language interface'. It perfectly embodies the research idea of a unified graph-language model (GraphLang) pretrained on diverse corpora and instruction-tuned for interactive reasoning. It explicitly references and aims to build upon the cited works (GraphText, GraphGPT, GraphLLM) by proposing a unified pretraining paradigm over heterogeneous graph-text data, which is identified as a gap. The objectives and methodology consistently follow from the background and motivation provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction sets the context and objectives concisely. The methodology section is detailed, outlining data sources, model architecture (with equations for key components), pretraining objectives (with loss formulations), instruction tuning, algorithmic pipelines, and a comprehensive experimental design including datasets, tasks, metrics, baselines, and ablations. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on recent trends (GraphText, GraphGPT, GraphLLM), its core novelty lies in the proposed *unified pretraining* strategy across *heterogeneous* graph-text corpora (knowledge graphs, molecules, scene graphs) using a combination of self-supervised objectives (masked reconstruction, graph-to-text generation, contrastive alignment, optional text-to-graph generation). This contrasts with prior works that might focus more on specific tuning methods or graph-to-text conversion for a single domain. The goal of creating a single, versatile foundation model pretrained in this unified manner, capable of zero-shot reasoning, retrieval, *and* language-driven editing across domains, represents a significant step forward. The novelty is clearly articulated in the introduction."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and mostly rigorous. The use of a multi-modal Transformer architecture with separate encoders and a joint stack is a well-established approach for fusing different modalities. The chosen pretraining objectives (masked modeling, sequence generation, contrastive learning) are standard and proven techniques in self-supervised and multi-modal learning. The instruction tuning phase is appropriate for developing interactive capabilities. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, ablation studies, and standard evaluation metrics for the targeted tasks. The technical formulations for embeddings, attention, and losses appear correct, although the Graph Transformer Encoder description is high-level. The overall methodology is well-justified and grounded in existing research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. Data collection relies on existing large-scale datasets (Freebase, Wikidata, PubChem, Visual Genome), which is positive, but curating, cleaning, and aligning these diverse graph-text pairs into a unified format for pretraining will require significant engineering effort. The proposed model architecture is large but comparable to other foundation models. The estimated training resources (32xA100 GPUs for ~2 weeks) are substantial but plausible for pretraining such a model. Synthesizing effective instruction tuning data is non-trivial. While challenging, the plan is generally realistic with adequate resources and expertise, placing it in the 'Good' feasibility range."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical challenge highlighted in the task description: making complex graph-structured data accessible and interactive via natural language, bridging the gap between powerful GNNs/graph data and user-friendly LLMs. Success would democratize access to graph data across many scientific (drug discovery, genomics, knowledge discovery) and industrial domains, potentially accelerating research and development. Enabling zero-shot graph QA, interactive retrieval, and language-driven editing would represent a major advancement in graph learning and AI usability. The planned open-source release further enhances its potential impact."
