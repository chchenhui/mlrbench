    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on ML for genomics, target identification, and foundation models. The proposed GCFM incorporates key elements from the research idea (multi-scale attention, GNNs, perturbation prediction) and aims to tackle challenges highlighted in the literature review (noise, complex interactions, multimodality). The methodology and objectives are logically derived from the background and problem statement, showing strong internal consistency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The problem, proposed solution (GCFM), objectives, and methodology are presented logically. The inclusion of mathematical sketches aids understanding. However, some specific architectural details, such as the precise mechanisms for 'multi-scale attention' (e.g., specific Transformer variants vs. dilated convolutions) and 'inductive regulatory graph learning' (beyond GAT attention), could be slightly more concrete for perfect clarity. Overall, it is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While components like attention for sequences and GNNs for GRNs exist, the proposed integration of multi-scale attention, an *inductive* GNN for regulatory interactions, and a perturbation prediction module within a single *foundation model* framework specifically for genomic circuits is innovative. This hybrid approach, particularly the emphasis on learning the graph structure and predicting perturbation effects as core model capabilities, distinguishes it from existing sequence-focused foundation models (like Enformer) or GRN inference methods cited (like Q-GAT, DiscoGen). The novelty lies in the specific architecture synthesis and the ambitious scope of the foundation model."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established and successful techniques (attention mechanisms, GNNs, foundation models, self-supervised learning). The methodology is well-reasoned, outlining appropriate data sources, preprocessing steps, a plausible hybrid architecture, relevant training objectives, and a comprehensive validation plan including comparisons and ablation studies. The technical formulations, though high-level, appear correct. The integration of diverse components (sequence, epigenomics, graph, perturbation) is ambitious but theoretically grounded. Minor uncertainties exist regarding the optimal way to implement the inductive graph learning and ensure robustness, but the overall approach is technically solid."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Required data is publicly available. However, training such a complex foundation model (multi-scale attention + GNN) on large genomic datasets demands substantial computational resources (GPU clusters) and advanced ML expertise. Integrating and optimizing the different modules (sequence encoder, GNN, perturbation head) and the multi-task pre-training objective will be complex and require careful engineering. While the plan is realistic, the implementation complexity and resource requirements lower the feasibility score slightly compared to simpler projects."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in genomics and drug discovery: understanding complex gene regulatory networks and predicting the effects of perturbations. Success would provide a powerful tool for deciphering disease mechanisms and accelerating target identification, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals. By advancing foundation models for genomics through the integration of sequence and graph reasoning, it also holds substantial scientific merit and could become a valuable resource for the research community."
