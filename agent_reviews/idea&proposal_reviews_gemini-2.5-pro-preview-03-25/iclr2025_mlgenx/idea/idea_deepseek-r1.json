        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging machine learning and genomics for target identification and emerging drug modalities (gene therapy). It explicitly fits into the 'Special Track on LLMs and Agentic AI', incorporating multiple listed topics such as RLHF/RL with lab feedback, knowledge retrieval (RAG, knowledge graph), efficient interactive system designs (agents, humans, biological tools), and LLM-powered design/planning. It also touches upon Main Track topics like perturbation biology, active learning, experimental design, and benchmarks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It defines the core components (LLM agent, RAG, KG, active learning, RLHF/lab feedback, lab-in-the-loop) and the overall goal (guided genomic perturbation design). The workflow involving proposal, prioritization, feedback, and refinement is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specifics of the 'curated biological knowledge graph' and the exact nature/scale of the 'automated lab tools' integration, but the central concept is well-defined and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like LLMs, RAG, KGs, active learning, and RLHF are used in ML and sometimes genomics, their integration into a single agentic system for *guided experimental perturbation design* with a *lab-in-the-loop reinforcement learning* mechanism is novel. This combination, particularly the closed loop between AI prediction, experimental execution (implied automation), and model refinement based on real lab feedback for this specific task, offers a fresh and advanced approach compared to typical disconnected prediction/validation cycles."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The ML components (LLM agent, RAG, active learning, RLHF) are generally feasible with current technology and expertise, although complex. However, the 'lab-in-the-loop' aspect, requiring seamless integration with automated lab tools for potentially high-throughput perturbation experiments and data acquisition, is a major hurdle. This requires substantial infrastructure, resources, interdisciplinary expertise (ML, bio, automation), and potentially long development cycles. Access to such automated facilities is not widespread, making full implementation challenging for many research groups."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in drug discovery and fundamental biology: efficiently identifying causal genomic elements and designing effective interventions like gene therapies. By aiming to automate and guide the experimental design process using iterative learning from real experiments, it has the potential to drastically reduce costly trial-and-error cycles, accelerate the discovery of therapeutic targets, and generate deeper biological insights. Success would represent a major advancement in applying AI to functional genomics and therapeutic development."
