        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It proposes a 'Foundation model for genomics' (a key topic in the Main Track) aimed at understanding gene regulation ('Modeling long-range dependencies', 'Perturbation biology') for 'target identification' and 'drug discovery', which are central themes of the workshop. It directly addresses the goal of bridging machine learning and genomics by proposing a novel ML architecture (Attention + GNNs, another listed topic) for a core biological problem."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation outlines the problem (modeling complex gene regulation) and its importance effectively. The main idea clearly describes the proposed model type (foundation model), its core components (Attention + GNN), and the key innovations (multi-scale attention, graph induction, perturbation prediction). The intended application (in silico screening) is also clearly stated. While implementation details are high-level, the overall concept and goals are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While foundation models, attention, and GNNs are existing concepts, their specific combination for modeling genomic regulatory circuits, particularly the integration of an explicit 'regulatory graph induction' component within the foundation model architecture, appears innovative. Combining this with multi-scale attention tailored for genomics and a perturbation prediction module presents a fresh approach compared to standard sequence models or separate perturbation prediction tools. It builds upon existing work but proposes a unique synthesis for this specific biological challenge."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical and resource challenges. Required datasets (ENCODE, Roadmap, GTEx) are available. However, training a large foundation model on such data demands substantial computational resources (GPU clusters). Integrating multi-scale attention, GNNs, and graph induction into a cohesive, trainable architecture requires advanced ML expertise. Robustly validating the learned regulatory circuits and perturbation predictions biologically will also be challenging. While possible with current technology and expertise, implementation requires significant effort and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding gene regulatory networks is a fundamental challenge in biology with direct implications for drug discovery and understanding disease mechanisms, aligning perfectly with the workshop's emphasis. Successfully developing such a model could lead to major advancements in identifying novel therapeutic targets, predicting the effects of genetic or chemical perturbations, and providing deeper insights into complex biological systems. The potential impact on both basic science and translational medicine is substantial."
