    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem highlighted in the task description: the degradation of foundation model robustness during fine-tuning for specialized tasks under distribution shift. The proposed method, Robustness Teacher Distillation (RTD), directly implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea (robustness teacher, hybrid loss, activation regularization). Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon relevant work cited in the literature review (e.g., Kumar et al. on the problem, Wortsman et al. and Yang et al. for baseline methods, Radford et al. for foundation models, Hu et al. for LoRA) and positions itself appropriately within the existing research landscape. The chosen application domains (WILDS, medical/legal NLP) and evaluation metrics directly correspond to the interests expressed in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to a detailed methodology and expected outcomes. Key concepts like the RTD framework, the hybrid loss function components (task, KD, AR), OOD example generation, and the training algorithm (including pseudocode) are explained precisely. Notation is introduced and used consistently. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is clearly specified. Objectives are stated quantitatively. While minor details like the exact selection criteria for the intermediate layer 'l' for activation regularization could be elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing techniques in a novel way to address a specific, challenging problem. While knowledge distillation (KD) for robustness (Zhou et al., Kim et al.) and activation matching are known concepts, the proposal's novelty lies in: (1) applying KD with the *original* foundation model as teacher specifically to mitigate *fine-tuning induced* robustness loss, (2) using KD on *generated OOD examples* tailored to the downstream domain shift, and (3) combining this OOD distillation with an *activation-preserving regularizer* to explicitly maintain internal representations from the robust teacher. This specific combination, particularly the dual focus on output distribution (KD) and internal activations (AR) guided by the pre-trained teacher on OOD data during fine-tuning, distinguishes it from prior work like standard KD, self-distillation (Yang et al.), or weight ensembling (Wortsman et al.). It's not introducing a fundamentally new mechanism but offers a fresh, well-motivated synthesis."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in well-established research findings (e.g., fine-tuning degrades OOD robustness - Kumar et al.) and employs standard, well-understood techniques (cross-entropy loss, KL divergence for distillation, L2 regularization for activations, AdamW optimizer). The proposed hybrid loss function is a principled approach to balancing multiple objectives. The methodology for generating OOD examples (perturbations, domain transformations) is sensible. The technical formulations (equations, notation) are correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is rigorous, involving relevant benchmarks (WILDS, domain-specific NLP), strong baselines (FT, LoRA, WiSE-FT, SDFT), and comprehensive metrics (ID/OOD accuracy, gap, ECE, efficiency). The plan includes ablation studies, further strengthening the rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on publicly available foundation models (CLIP, Llama-2), standard datasets (WILDS, MedNLI, BIOS), and common deep learning frameworks and hardware (GPUs). The proposed techniques (KD, activation regularization, data augmentation/perturbation) are complex but well within the capabilities of typical ML research labs. The experimental plan, while comprehensive, is realistic in scope. The main challenges (hyperparameter tuning, effective OOD generation) are standard research hurdles, not fundamental roadblocks. No exotic resources or unavailable technologies are required."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: ensuring the robustness of foundation models when adapted for specialized, often high-stakes, applications. As highlighted in the task description, distribution shifts severely limit the reliable deployment of models in areas like medicine and law. Successfully preserving robustness during fine-tuning, as proposed by RTD, would be a major advancement, potentially enabling safer and more equitable use of powerful foundation models. The goal of halving the robustness gap while maintaining ID performance is ambitious and impactful. The research also promises valuable insights into the mechanisms of robustness degradation and contributes a potentially widely applicable method, code, and models to the community."
