    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core problem highlighted in the task description: the loss of robustness when fine-tuning foundation models and the need for adaptation methods that preserve it, especially for specialized domains like biomedicine and legal text. The proposal accurately reflects the research idea by outlining a knowledge distillation framework using the original foundation model as a teacher, incorporating a hybrid loss, and using activation pattern regularization. It effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, referencing key papers on feature distortion (Kumar et al.), self-distillation (Yang et al.), KD for robustness (Zhou et al.), and robust fine-tuning (Wortsman et al.), positioning the work within the current research landscape described in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The introduction sets the context effectively, the research objectives and questions are specific and logically structured, and the significance is well-argued. The methodology section explains the core concepts (KD, activation regularization, hybrid loss) and provides mathematical formulations. The experimental plan outlines models, datasets, and baselines. Minor areas could benefit from refinement, such as providing more concrete examples of the domain-specific perturbations (x^{pert}) and transformations (x^{trans}) or specifying the criteria for selecting layers for activation regularization (L). However, these minor ambiguities do not significantly impede understanding the overall approach and goals."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining existing techniques (knowledge distillation, activation regularization) in a specific framework tailored to preserve robustness during foundation model fine-tuning. While KD and activation matching are not new concepts in themselves, the specific application—using the original foundation model as a 'robustness teacher', employing a hybrid loss that explicitly targets robustness via perturbed inputs alongside task performance and activation matching—constitutes a novel approach to this particular problem. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work like standard fine-tuning, efficiency-focused methods (LoRA), post-hoc ensembling (WiSE-FT), and standard self-distillation (SDFT) by integrating robustness preservation directly and multi-facetedly into the fine-tuning process. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and application context rather than inventing fundamentally new techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in existing research, citing relevant work on the problem (Kumar et al.) and related solutions (KD, regularization). The proposed methodology, combining KD with the original model as teacher and activation regularization, is logically derived from the goal of preserving pre-trained knowledge and robustness. The mathematical formulation of the loss function is clear and appropriate. The planned experiments use relevant benchmarks (WILDS) and standard models (Llama-2, CLIP), including comparisons against strong baselines. Minor weaknesses include the lack of specificity regarding the exact perturbations/transformations and layer selection for activation matching, and the inherent challenge of tuning the hyperparameters (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2). However, the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on publicly available foundation models (Llama-2, CLIP) and benchmark datasets (WILDS), reducing data acquisition barriers for initial validation. The proposed techniques (KD, activation regularization, fine-tuning) are standard in ML research, albeit requiring significant computational resources typical for foundation model work. Implementing the hybrid loss and integrating it into existing fine-tuning pipelines is technically achievable with standard ML frameworks. Potential challenges include hyperparameter tuning and the computational cost associated with teacher model inference and additional loss terms, but these are manageable risks within a typical research project scope."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in machine learning: the degradation of robustness when adapting powerful foundation models. This issue is a major bottleneck for deploying these models reliably in real-world, high-stakes applications (e.g., healthcare, legal) where distribution shifts are common, as highlighted by the workshop task description. A successful outcome, providing a method to fine-tune models without sacrificing robustness, would represent a substantial contribution to the field. It directly tackles one of the key research questions posed by the workshop (Adaptation) and has the potential for significant practical impact by enabling more reliable deployment of foundation models."
