        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the task description: adapting foundation models to downstream tasks without sacrificing robustness to distribution shifts. The proposed knowledge distillation approach using a 'robustness teacher' and a hybrid loss function perfectly matches the research idea. Furthermore, the methodology builds upon concepts and addresses challenges identified in the literature review, such as robustness degradation during fine-tuning (Kumar et al.), the use of knowledge distillation for robustness (Zhou et al., Kim et al.), and balancing task performance with generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall methodology (robust teacher, hybrid loss, activation preservation), and evaluation plan are understandable. The structure is logical. However, some key details lack specificity. For instance, the method for generating or selecting the 'out-of-distribution examples' used for the distillation loss ('controlled perturbations and domain-specific transformations') is not elaborated upon, which is a crucial component. Similarly, the implementation details of 'activation pattern preservation' (e.g., which layers, which diverse inputs) and the strategy for tuning the hyperparameters (lambda1, lambda2, and the implicit weight for the regularization term) could be clearer."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates satisfactory novelty. The core idea of using knowledge distillation to preserve robustness during fine-tuning is not entirely new, as evidenced by the literature review (e.g., Zhou et al., Kim et al., Yang et al.). However, the specific combination of using the original foundation model as a 'robustness teacher', focusing the distillation loss explicitly on OOD examples generated via specific (though underspecified) methods, and adding an activation pattern preservation regularizer presents a novel configuration tailored to the foundation model fine-tuning context. It's more of an innovative combination and refinement of existing techniques rather than a groundbreaking new method."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established machine learning principles like knowledge distillation and regularization. The motivation is well-supported by prior work (Kumar et al.). The proposed hybrid loss function and activation pattern regularization are technically plausible. The experimental design includes necessary components like baseline comparisons and evaluations on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance using standard metrics and relevant benchmarks (WILDS). However, the lack of detail regarding the generation of OOD examples for distillation introduces a minor gap, as the effectiveness of the method hinges on this aspect. The assumption that the original foundation model is always the optimal 'robust teacher' for any downstream OOD scenario might also need further justification or exploration."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing foundation models, standard fine-tuning procedures, and knowledge distillation techniques, which are well-supported by current deep learning frameworks and libraries (like Hugging Face). Access to benchmark datasets like WILDS is possible. While collecting specific high-stakes domain data can be challenging, leveraging existing benchmarks mitigates this. The main challenges are computational resources (inherent in working with foundation models, though KD is relatively efficient) and the practical implementation details like effective OOD example generation and hyperparameter tuning, which seem manageable with standard ML expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem in the deployment of foundation models: the loss of robustness during fine-tuning, especially for high-stakes applications explicitly mentioned in the task description (healthcare, criminal justice). Successfully preserving robustness while adapting models to specialized tasks would be a major advancement, enabling more reliable real-world use of these powerful models. The research directly tackles a key question posed by the workshop and has the potential to make substantial contributions to the field of trustworthy ML and foundation model adaptation."
