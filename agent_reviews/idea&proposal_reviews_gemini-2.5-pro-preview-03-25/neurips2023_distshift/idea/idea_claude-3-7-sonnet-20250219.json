        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task focuses on distribution shifts in foundation models, specifically asking 'how can we adapt models to downstream tasks without sacrificing robustness?'. The proposed idea directly addresses this question by suggesting a knowledge distillation framework to preserve robustness during fine-tuning. It explicitly mentions foundation models, distribution shifts, fine-tuning (adaptation), and the problem of robustness degradation, all central themes of the workshop call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the core concept of using the original foundation model as a 'robustness teacher' via knowledge distillation is understandable. The components like the hybrid loss function and the goal of preserving generalization are clear. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise nature of the 'controlled perturbations and domain-specific transformations' for OOD examples and the specifics of the 'novel regularization technique', but the overall research direction is well-defined and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While knowledge distillation is an established technique, its specific application here – using the original foundation model as a teacher explicitly to preserve its *distributional robustness* during fine-tuning, guided by OOD examples and potentially novel activation regularization – offers a fresh perspective on the fine-tuning problem for large models. It's not a completely new paradigm, but it cleverly combines existing concepts to tackle a specific, important challenge highlighted in the context of foundation models and distribution shifts. The focus on preserving the *pre-trained* robustness, rather than just transferring task knowledge, adds to its novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Knowledge distillation frameworks are well-understood. Fine-tuning foundation models is standard practice. Generating OOD examples and implementing regularization techniques are achievable. However, the primary challenge lies in the computational resources required to run the large foundation model as a teacher during the fine-tuning process, which can be substantial. Designing effective OOD generation strategies specific to the target robustness also requires careful engineering. Overall, it's implementable within a well-resourced research environment but presents non-trivial computational hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized problem: the loss of robustness when adapting powerful foundation models to specialized tasks. This issue hinders their reliable deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law, which are explicitly mentioned as areas of interest. Developing methods to maintain robustness during fine-tuning, as proposed, would represent a major advancement, enabling safer and more effective use of foundation models in real-world applications prone to distribution shifts. The potential impact on practical ML deployment is substantial."
