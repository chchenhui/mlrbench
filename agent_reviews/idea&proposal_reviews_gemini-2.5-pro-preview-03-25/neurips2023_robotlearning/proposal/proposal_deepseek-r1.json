    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of pre-training, fine-tuning (specifically modular adaptation via adapters), generalization, safety, efficiency, and multi-modality for large models in robotics. The methodology precisely elaborates on the research idea (safety adapters, contrastive pre-training, safety-constrained RL). It effectively integrates concepts from the cited literature, positioning itself clearly against existing adapter methods (Sharma et al., Tang et al., Wu et al.) and safe RL techniques (Kim et al., Liu et al., Du et al., etc.), aiming to combine their strengths while addressing limitations like integrating safety directly with PEFT for VLMs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, two-phase methodology (pre-training and fine-tuning), and experimental design are presented logically. Key concepts like 'safety adapters', 'contrastive alignment', and 'shielded policy optimization' are defined, and the mathematical formulations are generally understandable. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact nature of the backup policy 'a_safe' or the specific risk measure beyond 'proximity', but these do not significantly hinder the overall comprehension of the proposed research plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating parameter-efficient fine-tuning (adapters) specifically with safety-constrained reinforcement learning (shielded policy optimization, safety critic) for adapting large vision-language models in robotics. While adapters and safe RL are existing fields (as shown in the literature review), their specific combination within a framework featuring 'safety adapters' pre-trained via contrastive alignment for state-action pairs appears novel. It offers a fresh perspective compared to adapter methods focused solely on efficiency/task performance or safe RL methods applied without considering PEFT for large pre-trained models. The novelty lies more in the synergistic combination and application context than in fundamentally new algorithms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (VLMs, adapters, contrastive learning, PPO, safety critics, shielding, CQL). The proposed two-phase methodology is logical and technically well-described, with appropriate mathematical formulations for the core components. The choice of methods is well-justified for achieving the goals of efficiency and safety. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics. A minor point of concern is the claim of 'provable safety', which is often hard to achieve in complex RL settings; 'empirically validated safety' or 'safety under specific assumptions' would be more precise. However, the overall technical approach is robust and well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing technologies (VLMs, adapters, RL algorithms, simulation environments like RLBench/Habitat) and standard computational resources (GPUs). The parameter-efficient nature of adapters makes the claim of rapid fine-tuning (<1 hour) plausible, though ambitious. The required multi-modal offline data is a potential bottleneck but common in robotics research. The main challenges lie in the implementation complexity of integrating all components and tuning the various hyperparameters (RL, safety critic, threshold), as well as potentially achieving the high quantitative targets for safety and generalization. Overall, the plan is realistic with manageable risks for a research project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying large pre-trained models (VLMs) in real-world robotics: the need for safe, efficient, and effective adaptation. Successfully combining parameter-efficiency (adapters) with safety guarantees (shielded RL) would be a major advancement, potentially democratizing the use of powerful VLMs on resource-constrained robots and enabling their application in safety-critical domains like homes, hospitals, and industry. The research directly tackles key challenges highlighted in the task description and literature review, with clear potential for substantial contributions to robot learning."
