    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key themes: efficient fine-tuning of large models, generalization, safety in deployment, multimodal data integration (vision, language, state/action), and the use of offline data. The methodology closely follows the research idea, detailing the safety adapters, contrastive pre-training, and safe RL components. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the cited literature (Sharma et al., KALIE, Liu et al., Du et al.), positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape and addressing identified challenges like data efficiency and safety constraints, which were missing in some prior works like Skip Tuning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology follows a logical progression from architecture to pre-training and fine-tuning. Key components like the SafetyAdapter architecture, contrastive loss, and safe RL framework (SafetyCritic, CQL) are explained with relevant formulations. The experimental design is clearly outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition and source of the binary safety label D(S, A) in the SafetyCritic loss, or a more explicit connection between the contrastive pre-training objective and the downstream RL task initialization. However, these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed approach."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing existing techniques in a novel way. While adapter-based fine-tuning and safe RL are established fields (as shown in the literature review), their specific combination within a unified framework for *vision-language models* in robotics, incorporating *contrastive pre-training* on offline logs for adapter initialization and a *learned safety critic* for shielded exploration, represents a fresh approach. It clearly distinguishes itself from related work like KALIE (by adding explicit safety mechanisms) and Skip Tuning (by using adapters and safety constraints). The novelty lies not in inventing fundamentally new components but in the specific integration tailored to safe and efficient VLM adaptation for robotics."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established methods like adapters, contrastive learning, safety critics/shielding, and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL). The technical formulations for the adapter, contrastive loss, and CQL appear correct. The methodology for the SafetyCritic is plausible, although the loss function details could be slightly more precise. A minor weakness is the claim of 'Formal Safety Guarantees' and 'Lyapunov stability analysis' in the expected outcomes, which is not substantiated with theoretical details or derivations within the methodology section itself. While plausible, this makes the claim of *formal* guarantees less rigorously supported by the proposal text provided. Overall, the approach is well-grounded in literature but lacks full rigor on the formal safety aspect within the proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing datasets (MetaWorld, RT-2) and standard hardware (UR5e robot, A6000 GPU). The parameter-efficient nature of adapters makes the goal of single-GPU fine-tuning plausible. Using offline logs reduces data collection burden. However, integrating the VLM, adapters, contrastive pre-training, safe RL components, and robot interface is a complex engineering task. Achieving the ambitious performance targets (e.g., <1 hour fine-tuning, <1000 interactions, >=85% success on novel objects, <=1 collision per 1000 episodes) presents moderate challenges and risks, particularly regarding the robustness of the learned safety critic in real-world scenarios and bridging the sim-to-real gap effectively."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses critical and timely challenges in applying large pre-trained models to robotics: the prohibitive cost of fine-tuning, the crucial need for safety during learning and deployment, and the demand for data efficiency and generalization. By aiming to provide a safe, efficient, and accessible method for adapting powerful VLMs, the research has the potential to democratize access to these models for smaller labs and accelerate progress in real-world robotic applications, particularly in safety-critical domains. The potential impact on robotics, safe AI, and cross-modal learning is substantial."
