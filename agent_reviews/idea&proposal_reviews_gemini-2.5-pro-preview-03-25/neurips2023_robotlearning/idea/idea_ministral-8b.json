    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description (Robot Learning Workshop). It directly addresses key themes such as fine-tuning large pre-trained models for robotics, combining different data modalities (vision, language, sensor data), generalization, efficiency concerns (limited hardware), and safe real-world deployment. These points align perfectly with the specific areas of interest listed in the workshop call, such as 'finetuning, or other modular adaptation mechanisms', 'combining large models and multimodal training for robotics', and 'safe real-world deployment'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea presents a clear motivation and outlines a logical sequence of steps (Data Collection, Pre-Training, Fine-Tuning, Evaluation). The overall goal is understandable. However, the core technical contribution – the 'adaptive multi-modal fine-tuning' mechanism – lacks specific detail. Terms like 'adaptive', 'modality fusion', and 'safety constraints' are mentioned, but the proposal does not elaborate on *how* these will be implemented technically. This ambiguity makes it somewhat difficult to fully grasp the precise methodology and innovation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea combines several relevant and current research threads: fine-tuning large models, multi-modal learning for robotics, efficiency, and safety. While the *combination* addresses a timely problem, the individual components are not inherently novel. Fine-tuning, multi-modal fusion, and considering safety are established areas. The potential novelty lies in the specific 'adaptive' mechanisms and the method for integrating 'safety constraints' during fine-tuning, but these aspects are not clearly defined. As presented, the idea seems more like an integration of existing concepts rather than proposing a fundamentally new technique or approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Utilizing existing large pre-trained models and standard fine-tuning techniques is practical. Collecting multi-modal robotics data is a common task, though potentially resource-intensive depending on the scale. The main challenges lie in developing the specific 'adaptive' fine-tuning algorithms and effectively integrating and evaluating 'safety constraints', especially in real-world scenarios. While challenging, these aspects are within the realm of current ML and robotics research capabilities, making the overall idea feasible with appropriate resources and effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses highly significant challenges in contemporary robotics. Efficiently adapting large pre-trained models to specific robotic tasks while ensuring safety is a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Improving generalization and performance through multi-modal data integration is also crucial. Success in this research could lead to more capable, reliable, and resource-efficient robotic systems, significantly impacting both academic research and real-world applications like autonomous navigation, manipulation, and human-robot interaction."
