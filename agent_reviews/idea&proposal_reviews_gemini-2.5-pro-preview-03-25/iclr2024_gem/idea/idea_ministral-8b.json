        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (GEM workshop). It directly addresses the workshop's core goal of bridging the gap between generative machine learning (GML) and experimental biology for biomolecular design. The idea explicitly proposes integrating GML techniques (like inverse design and modeling, mentioned in the workshop topics) with high-throughput experimentation and adaptive experimental design (also listed topics). It aims to move beyond static benchmarks towards real-world applications, which is a key motivation stated in the workshop description. The proposed hybrid approach fits seamlessly within the workshop's scope and could potentially contribute to both the in-silico and experimental tracks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation, the three-step methodology (GML training, experimental validation, iterative refinement), expected outcomes, and potential impact are articulated concisely and logically. Key concepts like GML, high-throughput experimentation, and adaptive design are appropriately used. There are no significant ambiguities in the core proposal of creating an iterative loop between computation and experimentation. Minor details about specific model architectures or experimental platforms could be added, but the overall concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses good novelty. While integrating computation and experimentation is not entirely new (e.g., active learning), the specific focus on tightly coupling modern *generative* ML models with *high-throughput*, *adaptively designed* experiments for *biomolecular design* in an iterative feedback loop represents a current and advanced research direction. Many efforts remain siloed in either purely computational or experimental domains. This proposal's emphasis on the synergistic, iterative process itself is innovative compared to standard practices. It's more of a novel synthesis and process innovation rather than inventing a fundamentally new algorithm or experimental technique from scratch, but it pushes the boundary of how these tools are used together."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents notable challenges. The required components – advanced GML models, high-throughput experimental platforms, and adaptive design algorithms – exist. However, successfully integrating them requires significant interdisciplinary expertise (ML, bioinformatics, experimental biology), substantial computational resources, and potentially expensive, time-consuming experimental cycles. Ensuring efficient data flow, reliable experimental feedback for model refinement, and managing the costs/logistics of the wet lab component are key hurdles. It's achievable within well-equipped labs or collaborations but is not straightforward."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It targets a critical bottleneck in biotechnology and medicine: the efficient design and validation of novel functional biomolecules. Successfully bridging the computational-experimental gap as proposed could dramatically accelerate the discovery of new drugs, therapies, diagnostics, industrial enzymes, and biomaterials. The potential impact spans major fields like medicine, industry, and environmental science, as outlined in the proposal. Furthermore, achieving interpretable models through this process could yield valuable fundamental biological insights."
