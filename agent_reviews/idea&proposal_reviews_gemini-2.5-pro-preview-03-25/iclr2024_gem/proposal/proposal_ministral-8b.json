    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging generative ML and experimental biology by proposing an 'adaptive experimental design' framework, a specific topic of interest. The proposal accurately reflects the core research idea, detailing the VAE-based generation, uncertainty/diversity-based selection, and iterative feedback loop. It also situates itself well within the provided literature, acknowledging key challenges (e.g., integrating feedback, resource optimization) and building upon recent related works (closed-loop systems, VAEs, Bayesian optimization/active learning for protein engineering)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The introduction sets the context well, the objectives are distinct, and the overall methodology (closed-loop iteration) is understandable. The algorithmic steps are outlined logically, and key components like the VAE and selection metrics (entropy, MMD) are mentioned, with some mathematical formulation provided. However, some areas could be refined. The integration of Bayesian Optimization, mentioned in the introduction and idea, is not explicitly detailed in the algorithmic steps, which focus more on uncertainty/diversity selection rules. The exact mechanism for updating the VAE model based on experimental feedback ('incorporating the experimental results' into the ELBO) could be more specific. The 'Experimental Validation' step is described at a very high level."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core concept of using closed-loop, adaptive experimental design with ML models (like VAEs) and experimental feedback for protein engineering is a recognized and active area of research, as evidenced by several papers in the literature review (e.g., Calvanese et al., 2025; Doe & Smith, 2024; Johnson & Williams, 2024; Chen & Brown, 2025). The proposal combines existing techniques (VAEs, uncertainty/diversity metrics, iterative refinement) rather than introducing a fundamentally new algorithm or approach. Its novelty lies more in the specific implementation and application to protein engineering, potentially refining existing methods, but it doesn't present a groundbreaking departure from the current state-of-the-art described in the recent literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established machine learning techniques (VAEs, uncertainty quantification, diversity metrics) and a standard paradigm for adaptive design (iterative generate-select-test-update loop). The theoretical basis is solid, and the inclusion of mathematical formulations for the VAE and entropy adds rigor. The proposed evaluation metrics (success rate, costs, convergence) are appropriate. The plan includes baseline comparisons and parameter tuning, which are good practices. Minor weaknesses include the underspecified mechanism for incorporating experimental feedback into the model update and the lack of explicit detail on the Bayesian Optimization aspect mentioned earlier."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily related to the experimental component. The computational aspects (VAE training, uncertainty calculation) are feasible with standard tools. However, the success hinges on the availability, cost, and turnaround time of the wet lab experiments required for the feedback loop. Establishing and running this closed-loop system requires tight integration between computational modeling and experimental validation, which can be logistically complex and resource-intensive. The proposal's success depends heavily on the efficiency and practicality of this experimental feedback cycle, which introduces considerable risk and uncertainty."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in protein engineering â€“ the efficient exploration of the vast sequence space constrained by expensive and time-consuming experiments. Successfully bridging the gap between computational prediction and experimental validation, as proposed, would accelerate the discovery of novel functional proteins for medical, industrial, and environmental applications. Reducing experimental costs and improving design success rates would be major contributions to the field. The research aligns perfectly with the goals of translational ML in biology."
