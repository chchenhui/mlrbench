        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 theme of 'Scaling up optimization' by focusing on how optimization algorithm choice and hyperparameters interact with model scaling. The objectives and methodology are clearly derived from the research idea, aiming to create 'Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws'. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon key papers mentioned in the literature review (Kaplan et al., Hoffmann et al., Li et al., Xie et al., Fetterman et al.) and directly tackles the identified challenges (hyperparameter sensitivity, cost, transferability, theoretical understanding). The proposed work fits squarely within the scope and motivation outlined in the provided materials."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, significance, and methodology are articulated concisely and logically. The research plan is detailed, outlining specific model architectures (Transformers), datasets (Pile/C4), optimizers (AdamW, SGD, Adafactor), hyperparameters to investigate, and evaluation metrics. The mathematical formulation for the hypothesized scaling laws is presented clearly. The distinction between the derivation phase and the validation phase is sharp. The structure is easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the project's goals and execution plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While building upon existing work on scaling laws (Kaplan et al., Hoffmann et al.) and recent studies on hyperparameter scaling (Li et al., Xie et al.), its novelty lies in the systematic investigation of how these scaling laws *differ across various optimization algorithms* (AdamW vs. SGD vs. Adafactor) and the explicit goal of creating a *unified framework* (h^*(N, O)) that incorporates the optimizer choice directly into the prediction. It aims to go beyond observing scaling for a single optimizer or hyperparameter by comparing optimizers and seeking theoretical explanations for differences (Objective 2, Methodology 3.3.5). This comparative, optimizer-centric approach to hyperparameter scaling laws represents a fresh and valuable extension of prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established scaling law research and recent empirical findings. The proposed methodology (systematic experiments, controlled variation of size/optimizer/HPs, power law fitting, validation on larger models with clear baselines) is robust and follows standard practices in the field. The choice of models, datasets, optimizers, and metrics is appropriate. The mathematical formulation for power laws is correct. Minor weaknesses include the immense computational challenge of the proposed sweeps (which might necessitate compromises in practice) and the ambitious nature of rigorously linking empirical scaling constants to optimizer theory, which might prove difficult. However, the core empirical approach is well-justified and technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily related to computational resources. Training numerous Transformer models across a wide range of sizes (up to 1-10B parameters for derivation, potentially larger for validation), for multiple optimizers, with extensive hyperparameter sweeps (grid search), and multiple random seeds requires access to substantial, potentially industry-scale, compute clusters. While technically achievable with sufficient resources, the cost and time commitment are very high. The proposal acknowledges this dependency ('contingent on available compute'). If resources are limited, the scope (number of sizes, optimizers, HP search density) would need to be reduced, potentially impacting the robustness of the findings. Therefore, feasibility is rated as satisfactory, heavily dependent on resource availability."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in modern AI: the exorbitant cost of hyperparameter tuning for large models. Successfully developing reliable Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws would lead to substantial reductions in computational cost, energy consumption, and research time. This aligns perfectly with the OPT 2024 focus and has broad practical implications for researchers and engineers working with large models. Furthermore, it promises deeper scientific insights into the interplay between optimization and scaling, potentially guiding future algorithm design. By potentially lowering the tuning barrier, it could also contribute to democratizing large model research. The potential contributions are substantial and clearly articulated."
