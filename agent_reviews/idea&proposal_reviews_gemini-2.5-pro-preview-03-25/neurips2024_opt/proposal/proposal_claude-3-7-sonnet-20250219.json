        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on 'Scaling up optimization,' particularly the questions around model size-dependent hyperparameters, the influence of optimization algorithms, and the derivation of scaling laws to reduce computational costs and environmental impact. The methodology clearly operationalizes the research idea of 'Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws'. Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, acknowledging recent relevant work (e.g., Opt-Laws, Predictable Scale) while proposing a systematic investigation across different optimizer types, addressing key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The introduction clearly motivates the problem and states the research question. The methodology is broken down into logical, well-explained phases (Systematic Experimentation, Derivation of Scaling Laws, Recommendation Framework, Validation). Specifics regarding model architectures, optimizers, hyperparameters, proposed mathematical forms for scaling laws, the recommendation algorithm, validation tasks, metrics, and implementation details are provided. The expected outcomes and impact are articulated concisely. The structure is logical and easy to follow, with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the concept of hyperparameter scaling laws is emerging (as shown in the very recent literature like Opt-Laws and Predictable Scale), this proposal's specific focus on systematically comparing *different classes* of optimizers (first-order, second-order, adaptive) and attempting to derive *optimizer-specific scaling functions* (f_o, g_o, h_o) within a unified framework offers a distinct contribution. It moves beyond studying a single optimizer or just learning rate/batch size, aiming for a more comprehensive, comparative understanding. It's not entirely groundbreaking given the concurrent work, but the proposed systematic approach and explicit modeling of optimizer characteristics provide significant novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established scaling law research (Kaplan et al.) and employs a standard, albeit large-scale, empirical methodology (controlled experiments, regression analysis). The hypothesis of power-law scaling is reasonable. The inclusion of diverse optimizers and model scales is methodologically strong. The validation plan is comprehensive, including relevant metrics and strong baselines (Bayesian Opt, manual tuning). The plan to develop theoretical justifications alongside empirical findings adds rigor. Minor weaknesses include the inherent difficulty in perfectly isolating scaling factors and the potential challenge in finding simple, universal forms for optimizer-specific functions (f_o, g_o, h_o), but the overall approach is scientifically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant computational challenges. Conducting extensive experiments, including hyperparameter searches, on models up to 10B parameters across multiple optimizers requires substantial GPU resources (A100s mentioned) and time. The multi-fidelity approach helps mitigate this, but the cost remains high. Managing the complexity of experiments and data analysis is demanding but achievable with the proposed tools (DeepSpeed, Ray Tune, etc.) and expertise. The derivation of theoretical justifications might also prove difficult. Assuming access to the necessary computational resources and expertise, the project is feasible, though ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in modern AI development: the prohibitive cost and resource consumption of hyperparameter tuning for large models. Success would lead to substantial computational savings (estimated 30-50% HPO cost reduction), reduced environmental impact, and potentially faster innovation cycles. By aiming to democratize large model training through more efficient HPO, it could broaden participation in cutting-edge research. Furthermore, advancing the theoretical understanding of optimization dynamics at scale is a scientifically important contribution. The research directly aligns with pressing needs in the ML community."
