    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Scaling up optimization' by investigating how optimizer hyperparameters scale with model size, data size, and optimizer choice, which is a key question raised in the task description. The research idea of deriving 'optimization-aware scaling laws' is precisely what the proposal outlines. Furthermore, the proposal acknowledges and aims to build upon the recent findings and challenges highlighted in the literature review (e.g., papers by Li et al., Xie et al., Fetterman et al., and the general problem of costly hyperparameter tuning)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology is broken down into logical phases (data collection/derivation, framework/validation) with specific, actionable steps. The experimental grid, the target scaling law forms (with explicit mathematical equations), the fitting procedure, and the validation plan (including baselines and metrics) are all clearly presented. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the literature review indicates that the concept of hyperparameter scaling laws is emerging (e.g., Li et al., Xie et al.), this proposal offers novelty through its systematic, empirical approach across multiple optimizers (AdamW, SGD, RMSprop) and a wider range of hyperparameters (LR, Batch Size, Momentum, Weight Decay). The specific analytical forms proposed and the plan to package these into a practical, lightweight recommendation tool represent a distinct contribution compared to purely theoretical work (like SDEs) or black-box optimization methods (like CARBS). It extends and systematizes recent findings rather than being entirely groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on the established concept of scaling laws and uses standard empirical methodologies. The experimental design (grid search over sizes/optimizers/HPs), method for identifying optimal HPs (validation loss), and statistical fitting approach (log-linear least squares) are appropriate. The validation plan with baselines and clear metrics is robust. Minor points for improvement include clarifying how the 'fixed budget of T gradient steps' ensures constant FLOPs across varying model/batch sizes, as this might need adjustment (e.g., fixing total tokens processed or FLOPs directly). The assumption of simple power laws is a reasonable starting point but might need refinement based on empirical results."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but computationally demanding. Training multiple large models (up to 10B parameters) across various configurations requires substantial GPU resources and time, typical for LLM research but still a significant undertaking. The methodology itself uses standard techniques (model training, data sampling, regression, software packaging) that are well-established. The main challenge lies in securing and managing the necessary compute budget. Assuming adequate resources are available, the plan is realistic, and the technical risks (e.g., poor fit of scaling laws) are manageable research challenges."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical bottleneck in large-scale ML: the prohibitive cost of hyperparameter tuning. Successfully deriving reliable scaling laws and providing a tool for hyperparameter recommendation would lead to substantial savings in compute time, cost, and energy consumption, directly addressing the environmental and economic concerns mentioned in the task description. It also holds scientific significance by contributing empirical data and analytical models to the understanding of optimization dynamics at scale, potentially democratizing access to large model training/fine-tuning."
