        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 focus on 'Scaling up optimization' and the specific questions raised about model size-dependent hyperparameters (like learning rates) for extrapolation, the influence of optimization algorithms on scaling laws, and the goal of reducing training costs for large models. The research topic falls squarely under the encouraged areas, particularly 'Scaling laws' and 'Deep learning optimization'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation explicitly states the gap in current scaling laws. The main idea clearly outlines the goal: deriving 'optimization-aware scaling laws' by studying the interaction between optimizer hyperparameters, model size, and optimizer choice. The proposed methodology (systematic experiments, quantification, formalization into a framework, validation) and expected outcomes (reduced costs, efficiency) are articulated concisely with no significant ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While scaling laws and hyperparameter optimization are established fields, the specific focus on deriving *predictive scaling laws* that explicitly incorporate optimization algorithm dynamics and their hyperparameters for the purpose of *transferring* hyperparameter settings across model scales offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond standard scaling laws (model/data size) and typical HPO methods by seeking generalizable principles governing hyperparameter scaling."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges, primarily related to computational cost. Running systematic experiments across various model sizes, optimizers, and hyperparameter settings requires significant compute resources, especially if targeting very large models directly. However, the methodology itself (controlled experiments, data analysis, framework development) uses standard techniques. Focusing validation on LLM fine-tuning, as mentioned, makes the experimental validation more tractable than full pre-training experiments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Finding reliable ways to extrapolate optimal hyperparameters across model scales addresses a critical bottleneck in training large models, which currently involves costly trial-and-error. Success would lead to substantial savings in computational resources, time, and energy, directly contributing to more efficient and sustainable AI development, aligning perfectly with the stated impact goals in the task description."
