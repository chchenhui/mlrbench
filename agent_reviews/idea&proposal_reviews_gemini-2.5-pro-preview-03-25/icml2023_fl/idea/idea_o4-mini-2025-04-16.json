    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses two explicitly listed topics of interest: 'Autotuned federated algorithms for hyperparameters, model architectures, etc.' and 'Differential privacy and other privacy-preserving technologies in federated settings'. Furthermore, it aligns perfectly with the workshop's central theme of bridging the gap between theoretical research (meta-learning, automated ML) and practical applications of federated learning by tackling the laborious and privacy-sensitive task of tuning in real-world FL systems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the core concept of a two-stage meta-learning framework for joint HPO and NAS in FL with privacy is understandable. Key components like local optimization, private meta-summaries, and server aggregation are mentioned. However, some aspects lack specific detail, such as the exact nature of the 'proxy tasks', the structure of the 'lightweight architecture templates', the precise form of the 'meta-summaries' beyond examples, and the specifics of the 'global surrogate' model. Minor ambiguities exist that would require further elaboration for complete understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While automated HPO/NAS and meta-learning are known concepts, and their application to FL is an active research area, FedMetaTune proposes a specific combination that appears innovative. The novelty lies in the integrated, two-stage meta-learning approach for *both* hyperparameters and architectures simultaneously within FL, coupled with a specific privacy mechanism based on aggregating differentially-private meta-summaries (gradients, surrogate updates). This specific combination and mechanism offer a fresh perspective compared to works focusing solely on HPO or NAS, or using different privacy/optimization techniques in FL."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Meta-learning itself can be complex. Performing local Bayesian optimization and gradient-based architecture adaptation on potentially resource-constrained client devices could be computationally demanding. Ensuring the effectiveness and correctness of differential privacy applied to meta-gradients or surrogate model updates requires careful design and analysis. Aggregating these diverse private summaries into a coherent and useful global surrogate model is non-trivial. While conceptually sound, successful implementation would require considerable engineering effort and careful tuning of the meta-learning process itself. The use of 'proxy tasks' and 'lightweight' templates suggests awareness of these challenges, but their effectiveness is key to feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Hyperparameter and architecture tuning is a critical bottleneck in deploying FL systems effectively across diverse devices and data distributions. Automating this process in a privacy-preserving manner directly addresses a major practical challenge. Success would lead to faster model convergence, better performance, reduced manual effort, and potentially wider adoption of FL. It directly contributes to making FL systems more scalable, robust, and practical, aligning with the workshop's goal of fostering research with real-world impact."
