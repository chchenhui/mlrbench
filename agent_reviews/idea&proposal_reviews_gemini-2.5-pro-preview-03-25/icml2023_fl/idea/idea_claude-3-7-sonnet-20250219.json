    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description (workshop call for papers). It directly addresses a key topic listed: 'Approaches for addressing distribution shifts and continual learning in federated settings'. Furthermore, it aligns perfectly with the workshop's overall goal of bridging the gap between FL theory and practice by focusing on robustness and performance in 'real-world federated settings' where distribution shifts are common. The mention of privacy and communication overhead also touches upon practical constraints relevant to the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation is explicitly stated, and the proposed solution is broken down into three distinct phases (detection, aggregation, personalization). The core concept of an adaptive framework with a feedback loop is understandable. While specific details about the statistical measures, meta-learning techniques, or the exact mechanism of the feedback loop are not fully elaborated, the overall structure and objective are clearly defined, leaving only minor ambiguities typical for a research idea summary."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like distribution shift detection, adaptive aggregation, and meta-learning for personalization exist in FL literature, the proposed integration of these three elements into a continuously adaptive framework with a feedback loop learning optimal adaptation strategies for specific shift types offers a fresh perspective. The novelty lies more in the dynamic, holistic system design and the learning-based adaptation mechanism rather than in fundamentally new algorithmic building blocks. It combines existing concepts in a potentially innovative way to address the dynamic nature of distribution shifts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. Lightweight statistical measures for local computation are plausible, adaptive aggregation is implementable on the server, and meta-learning is a known technique. However, challenges exist: ensuring the 'lightweight' nature of detection across diverse data/devices, defining the 'target distribution' for aggregation, managing the potential computational cost of meta-learning on clients, and efficiently implementing the feedback loop without excessive communication/computation overhead. While technically plausible, successful implementation requires careful engineering and empirical validation, placing it in the 'Good' feasibility range."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Distribution shift is a critical bottleneck hindering the reliable deployment of FL models in diverse, real-world environments. Developing robust and adaptive mechanisms to handle these shifts is crucial for advancing the field and enabling practical applications. An effective solution, as proposed, would lead to more reliable and performant FL systems, directly contributing to the workshop's focus on real-world impact and addressing a major challenge faced by practitioners."
