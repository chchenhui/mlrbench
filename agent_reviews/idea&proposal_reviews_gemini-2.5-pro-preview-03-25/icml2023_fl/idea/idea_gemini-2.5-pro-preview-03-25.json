        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea 'FedPEFT' aligns excellently with the task description (workshop call). The workshop explicitly lists 'Training, fine-tuning, and personalizing (foundation) models in federated settings' as a key topic of interest, which is precisely what FedPEFT addresses. Furthermore, the idea tackles practical challenges like scalability (reducing communication/computation costs) and heterogeneity ('Heterogeneous Devices'), which resonates strongly with the workshop's aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice in FL and discuss 'Scalable and robust federated machine learning systems' and 'Theoretical studies with realistic assumptions for practical settings'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (challenges of fine-tuning large FMs in FL) is explicitly stated. The core proposal (using PEFT techniques like LoRA/Adapters in FL, communicating only small modules) is unambiguous. Key research directions (adaptive allocation, novel aggregation) are identified, and the expected outcomes (efficiency, privacy, utility) are clearly articulated. The idea is concise and immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses good novelty. While the general concept of combining Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Federated Learning (FL) is emerging in recent literature, FedPEFT proposes specific novel contributions. The key innovations lie in the 'adaptive PEFT module allocation based on client device capabilities and data characteristics' and the development of 'novel aggregation strategies tailored for sparse, low-rank PEFT updates'. These aspects address specific challenges of heterogeneity and efficient aggregation in the context of federated PEFT, offering fresh perspectives beyond simply applying existing PEFT methods in FL."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. PEFT methods are designed for efficiency, making their execution on client devices more practical than full fine-tuning. Standard FL frameworks can be adapted. The main challenges, requiring significant research effort, are developing and validating the proposed 'adaptive PEFT module allocation' mechanism (which requires robust device/data profiling) and the 'novel aggregation strategies'. However, these are research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks. Compared to the baseline of federated full fine-tuning of FMs, this approach is significantly more practical. Necessary expertise in both FL and PEFT is required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck preventing the widespread adoption of large Foundation Models within the privacy-preserving framework of Federated Learning, namely the prohibitive communication and computation costs on heterogeneous edge devices. Successfully implementing FedPEFT could enable efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving personalization of state-of-the-art models across a vast range of devices, leading to major advancements in practical FL applications and aligning perfectly with the workshop's focus on real-world impact."
