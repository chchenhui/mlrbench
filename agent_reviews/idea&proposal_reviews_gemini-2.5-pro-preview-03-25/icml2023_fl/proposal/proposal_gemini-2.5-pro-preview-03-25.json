    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on practical FL, scalable systems, fine-tuning FMs in federated settings, and handling heterogeneity. It systematically expands the core research idea (FedPEFT for adaptive, efficient FM fine-tuning) into a detailed plan. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging existing methods (like the original FedPEFT by Sun et al., SLoRA, FeDeRA, FedP^2EFT) and clearly articulating its novel contributions (dynamic adaptation based on *both* system and data heterogeneity, and novel aggregation for heterogeneous PEFT updates) to address identified gaps. The objectives and methodology directly follow from the motivation and literature context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured, clearly written, and uses precise language. The background, problem statement, objectives, and methodology are logically presented and generally easy to understand. The core concepts of adaptive PEFT allocation and heterogeneous aggregation are explained well. The experimental design is detailed and clear. Minor ambiguities exist in the exact implementation details of the more advanced proposed techniques (e.g., 'learning-based' adaptation, 'subspace aggregation'), but this level of detail is often acceptable at the proposal stage. Overall, the proposal effectively communicates its intentions and plan."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality and innovation within the federated PEFT domain. While building upon the existing idea of using PEFT in FL (FedPEFT, SLoRA, etc.), it introduces two key novel aspects: 1) A dynamic adaptation mechanism for PEFT configurations (e.g., LoRA rank) based on a combination of client system resources *and* data characteristics, going beyond fixed configurations or adaptation based primarily on data heterogeneity or personalization alone. 2) Novel aggregation strategies specifically designed to handle the *structurally heterogeneous* PEFT updates resulting from this adaptation (e.g., averaging updates with different LoRA ranks). This addresses a practical challenge often overlooked in prior work focusing on homogeneous updates or data heterogeneity mitigation through other means. The novelty is clearly articulated against the backdrop of the provided literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations (FL, FMs, PEFT/LoRA). The proposed methodology follows established FL protocols while integrating the novel components. The adaptive allocation mechanisms (rule-based, learning-based) and the proposed aggregation strategies (Padding/Truncation, Subspace, Rank-Stratified) are conceptually plausible approaches to the identified problems. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant datasets, models, heterogeneity simulation, strong baselines, and appropriate metrics. While the most advanced techniques (learning-based adaptation, subspace aggregation) lack full technical specification, the overall approach is well-justified and technically grounded. The plan to compare different strategies adds to the rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Implementation can leverage existing FL frameworks and PEFT libraries. Simulating heterogeneity and implementing rule-based adaptation and simpler aggregation methods (padding/truncation) are standard or straightforward. However, simulating FL with large FMs (even moderately sized ones like Llama-7B) across many clients and rounds requires significant computational resources (GPU clusters), which might be a bottleneck. The more advanced techniques (learning-based adaptation, subspace aggregation) may require considerable research and development effort. The overall scope is ambitious, covering multiple adaptation and aggregation strategies, requiring careful project management. It is feasible with adequate resources and potentially by prioritizing core components first."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: enabling the efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning of large foundation models in practical, heterogeneous federated learning settings. This is a major bottleneck for deploying advanced AI capabilities in decentralized scenarios. By tackling both system and data heterogeneity via adaptive PEFT and novel aggregation, the research has the potential to make substantial contributions to both FL and PEFT research. Success would have significant practical impact, potentially unlocking numerous real-world applications (e.g., on-device personalized assistants, collaborative healthcare AI) and aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of bridging FL theory and practice for FMs."
