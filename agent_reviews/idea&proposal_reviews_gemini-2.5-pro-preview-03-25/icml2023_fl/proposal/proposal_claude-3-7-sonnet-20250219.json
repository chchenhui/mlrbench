        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on practical FL for foundation models, heterogeneity, personalization, and efficiency. It elaborates significantly on the initial research idea, providing concrete mechanisms. Furthermore, it correctly identifies and builds upon the cited literature (SLoRA, FeDeRA, FedPEFT, etc.), positioning FedPEFT+ as a necessary advancement to handle adaptive allocation and specialized aggregation, which are identified limitations or underexplored areas in prior work. The objectives and methodology directly tackle the key challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as data/system heterogeneity and resource constraints."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The introduction effectively sets the context and motivation. The research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section details the proposed framework, including adaptive allocation, local training, aggregation strategies, and heterogeneity handling, with supporting mathematical formulations. The experimental design is comprehensive and easy to understand. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise estimation methods for the components of the utility function (R(c,p), C(c,p), E(c,p)) and the exact implementation details of the knowledge distillation for heterogeneous PEFT fusion. However, these do not significantly detract from the overall clarity and understanding of the proposed research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, although it builds heavily on existing concepts of PEFT and FL. The core idea of applying PEFT in FL is not new (as evidenced by FedPEFT, SLoRA, FeDeRA). However, the novelty lies in the proposed *adaptive* allocation mechanism that dynamically selects PEFT modules (LoRA, Adapters, Prompt Tuning) based on a utility function considering *both* client resources and data characteristics. Additionally, the development of *specialized* aggregation strategies tailored to different PEFT structures (Weighted LoRA, Layer-wise Importance, Heterogeneous Fusion via Distillation) and the integrated approach to handling system and data heterogeneity (clustering, async, adaptive precision) represent a novel combination and extension of prior work. It moves beyond simply applying a single PEFT method uniformly or using standard aggregation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established principles of Federated Learning, Foundation Models, and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning. The proposed methodology, including the adaptive allocation concept, specialized aggregation, and heterogeneity handling techniques, is logically derived and technically plausible. The mathematical formulations provided are appropriate for the described methods. The experimental design is thorough, featuring relevant models/tasks, realistic heterogeneity simulation, strong baselines (including direct competitors), and necessary ablation studies, indicating a rigorous evaluation plan. While the practical estimation of the utility function and the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation fusion require empirical validation, the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The required expertise (FL, FMs, PEFT) and computational resources (especially for 7B models) are significant but attainable in a well-equipped research environment. Standard libraries can be leveraged. Key challenges include the practical implementation and tuning of the adaptive PEFT allocation mechanism (requiring accurate client profiling and utility estimation), the development and validation of the specialized aggregation methods (especially the distillation part), and managing the complexity of the comprehensive experimental setup. The plan is ambitious, particularly the scale of experiments, but the steps are logical and build on existing work, making it generally realistic with adequate resources and time."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: enabling the efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning of large foundation models in practical federated settings characterized by device and data heterogeneity. This is a critical bottleneck limiting the widespread adoption of FMs. If successful, the research has the potential for major impact by democratizing access to FMs, enhancing on-device AI capabilities, reducing the environmental footprint of AI training, and improving personalization while preserving privacy. The expected contributions are substantial and align perfectly with the goals outlined in the task description for bridging the gap between FL theory and practice."
