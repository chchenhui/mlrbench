    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on structured probabilistic inference (graph normalizing flows) for scientific applications (molecular conformation generation) and explicitly tackles the challenge of encoding domain knowledge (physics-based energy penalties). The methodology directly implements the research idea, and the proposal clearly positions itself relative to the cited literature (ConfFlow, GeoDiff, etc.), aiming to address the identified challenges like incorporating physical constraints and ensuring invariance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The use of specific datasets (GEOM-QM9, GEOM-Drugs), the description of the model architecture (equivariant graph coupling layers, physics penalty), the training objective, and the experimental plan (baselines, metrics) are presented with high clarity. Minor details, like the specific GNN architecture within coupling layers, are omitted, but this is acceptable at the proposal stage and does not hinder overall understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While graph normalizing flows and physics-informed machine learning are existing concepts, the specific combination of using equivariant graph normalizing flows directly for 3D conformation generation *and* integrating an explicit, lightweight force-field energy term into the training loss appears novel compared to the cited literature. It differs from ConfFlow (lacks explicit physics), GeoDiff (diffusion-based), MolGrow (generates graph topology, not conformations), and GraphEBM (EBM for graph topology). This targeted integration addresses a key challenge highlighted in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations: normalizing flows for generative modeling, GNNs for graph data, equivariance principles for molecular data, and physics-based energy potentials. The methodology, including equivariant layers, the combined loss function, standard datasets, and relevant evaluation metrics, is well-justified. The technical formulations (energy function, flow update) are appropriate. Minor potential weaknesses include the sensitivity to the hyperparameter lambda and the limitations inherent in using a simplified force field, but the overall approach is technically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on publicly available datasets (GEOM) and standard ML techniques (GNNs, NFs) implementable with existing libraries (PyG, DGL) and hardware (GPUs). Calculating the simplified physics penalty is computationally tractable. While implementing equivariant graph flows and carefully tuning the combined loss function requires significant effort and expertise (assumed present), it does not necessitate breakthroughs in fundamental technology. The primary risks involve achieving the ambitious performance targets relative to strong baselines, rather than fundamental implementability issues."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in computational chemistry and drug discovery: the efficient generation of physically valid and diverse molecular conformations. Success would directly impact these fields by potentially accelerating virtual screening and molecular design. The approach of explicitly integrating physical laws into a deep generative model is impactful, enhancing the reliability and interpretability of AI-generated structures. The methodology also has potential applicability to other scientific domains involving structured data governed by physical principles, aligning well with the workshop's themes."
