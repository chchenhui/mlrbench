    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the challenge of adapting SOTA methods to resource-constrained environments, specifically focusing on limited computational resources (model compression) and the problem of pre-training data bias not reflecting local environments (domain shift). It falls squarely within the 'Algorithms and Methods' topic, particularly 'Approaches to training and inference on resource constrained devices' and methods tailored for data reflecting local realities (addressing domain shift implicitly tackles issues related to data representation). The motivation explicitly echoes the task's introduction regarding the gap between SOTA requirements and developing country capacities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, core concept (integrating domain adaptation into compression), proposed mechanisms (domain-aware distillation/pruning), validation strategy (real-world tasks, baselines), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The use of examples like TB detection enhances understanding. It clearly explains *what* is proposed and *why* it's needed."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While model compression and domain adaptation are established fields, their explicit integration *guided by* target-domain data to *preserve* domain-specific features during compression for low-resource deployment is a relatively fresh perspective. Standard compression often optimizes globally, potentially harming performance on specific, shifted target domains. This approach specifically targets that gap by making the compression process itself domain-aware. It's a novel combination and application focus rather than a completely new technique."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. It builds upon existing techniques like knowledge distillation, pruning, and domain adaptation methods (adversarial alignment, activation analysis). Implementing these modifications within standard ML frameworks is practical. The requirement for only a 'small amount' of target-domain data aligns well with the 'low-resource' constraint. While acquiring specific real-world datasets (like mobile X-rays) presents logistical challenges common to applied research, the technical approach itself is sound and implementable with current technology and knowledge."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying advanced ML models effectively in developing regions: the trade-off between resource efficiency and performance on local, often domain-shifted, data. Success would mean enabling more accurate and reliable ML applications in vital sectors like healthcare and agriculture within resource constraints, directly contributing to the 'democratization' of ML and ensuring solutions are equitable and locally effective, aligning perfectly with the task's goals."
