    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task explicitly calls for methods addressing limited computational resources and data scarcity in developing countries, listing 'model distillation' as a relevant technique under 'Algorithms and Methods'. The proposed 'Adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Low-Resource Environments' directly targets these constraints, aiming to make advanced ML models deployable in such settings. The motivation aligns perfectly with the task's goal of democratizing ML and overcoming resource barriers in developing countries."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is clearly articulated. The motivation, main idea (adaptive KD), and key innovations (resource-aware teacher selection, selective feature imitation, incremental learning) are well-defined and easy to understand. The claimed benefits (compute reduction, performance maintenance) are specific, providing a clear target. While the exact mechanisms for implementing the adaptive components are not detailed, the overall concept and its components are presented with good clarity for a research proposal summary."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While knowledge distillation is an established field, the proposed *adaptive* framework combining resource-aware teacher selection (based on available compute), selective feature imitation (based on task relevance), and incremental learning (adapting to changing resources over time) specifically for low-resource environments offers a fresh perspective. Standard KD often assumes static resources or focuses adaptation differently. The combination of these three specific adaptive strategies tailored for the target environment constitutes a notable innovation over standard KD practices."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible. Knowledge distillation techniques are well-understood. The proposed adaptive components build upon existing concepts: resource monitoring is possible, feature importance estimation methods exist, and incremental learning is an active research area. Integrating these components effectively presents the main challenge, but it seems achievable with current ML frameworks and techniques. The focus on efficiency suggests practicality is a core consideration. Standard ML resources (compute for training/evaluation, data) are required, but the method itself aims to reduce these requirements."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea holds high significance and potential impact. It directly addresses the critical challenge of deploying sophisticated ML models in resource-constrained environments, particularly relevant for developing countries as highlighted in the task description. If successful in achieving the claimed efficiency gains while maintaining performance, this research could enable the practical application of advanced AI in vital sectors like healthcare and agriculture in regions with limited infrastructure, contributing significantly to the democratization of ML and providing tangible benefits."
