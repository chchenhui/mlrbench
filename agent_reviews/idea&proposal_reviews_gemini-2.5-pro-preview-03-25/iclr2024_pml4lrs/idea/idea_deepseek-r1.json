        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined: data scarcity, biased models, computational constraints, and the need for ML solutions tailored to developing regions. It explicitly proposes methods relevant to the 'Algorithms and Methods' topic, including generating training data in data-scarce settings (synthetic data), ML techniques for limited data (active learning), and approaches for resource-constrained devices (lightweight models, quantization). The motivation and impact directly echo the goals stated in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly articulates the problem (data/compute scarcity in developing regions), the proposed solution (SynDA framework combining lightweight generative models and active learning), the key components (prompt-guided generation, uncertainty/representativeness sampling, compute efficiency techniques), and the expected outcomes (reduced labeling, improved adaptability). The flow is logical and easy to understand. Minor details on specific model choices or evaluation metrics could be further specified, but the core concept is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While synthetic data generation and active learning are established fields, their specific combination within the SynDA framework tailored for low-resource developing regions offers notable innovation. Key novel aspects include the emphasis on *lightweight*, compute-efficient generative models (distilled diffusion/tiny GANs) for this context, the use of prompt-guided generation specifically for cultural/environmental relevance, and the dual active learning criteria (uncertainty *and* domain representativeness) to mitigate synthetic data bias. It's a novel synthesis and application focus rather than a completely new algorithm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Lightweight generative models, active learning frameworks, model quantization, and prompt engineering are existing technologies. Combining them is an engineering challenge but doesn't rely on unproven concepts. The requirement for minimal local seed data is realistic. The explicit focus on computational efficiency (quantization, proxy networks) enhances its practicality in resource-constrained settings. Potential challenges include ensuring the quality and diversity of synthetic data from lightweight models and effectively integrating the components, but these seem surmountable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles critical barriers (data scarcity, domain relevance, computational cost) that severely limit ML deployment in developing regions across vital sectors like healthcare and agriculture. Successfully reducing labeling costs and improving model robustness to local contexts could lead to major advancements in applying ML to solve real-world problems in these areas, directly contributing to the task's goal of democratizing ML."
