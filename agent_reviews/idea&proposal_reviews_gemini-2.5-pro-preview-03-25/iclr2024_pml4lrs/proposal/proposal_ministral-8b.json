    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the task (data scarcity, computational constraints, domain mismatch in low-resource settings) by proposing solutions explicitly mentioned as relevant topics (data generation, active learning, model optimization). The methodology perfectly reflects the research idea, detailing the SynDA framework. It effectively synthesizes concepts from the literature review, positioning itself within current research on synthetic data, active learning, and efficient models for low-resource environments, while also addressing the key challenges identified in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, flowing from introduction and objectives to methodology, evaluation, and impact. The objectives are distinct, and the methodology sections break down the approach into understandable steps (e.g., generative model selection, prompt-guided augmentation, uncertainty estimation, proxy networks). Evaluation metrics are clearly listed. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise method for measuring 'domain representativeness' in the active learning loop or the specific lightweight models beyond examples, but these do not significantly hinder overall comprehension."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing techniques (synthetic data generation, active learning, model quantization, proxy networks) into a specific framework (SynDA) tailored for low-resource developing regions. While combining data generation and active learning isn't entirely new (as shown in the literature review), the novelty lies in the emphasis on *lightweight* generative models, *context-aware* generation using local seeds and prompts relevant to developing regions, and the explicit integration of *computational efficiency* measures (quantization, proxy networks) throughout the pipeline. It offers a fresh configuration distinct from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established foundations in synthetic data augmentation, active learning, and model optimization, supported by the provided literature. The rationale for combining these techniques to address data and compute limitations is logical. The proposed methodological steps (using local seeds, prompt guidance, uncertainty/representativeness for AL, quantization, proxy networks) are technically plausible. Minor weaknesses include the potential challenge of generating high-quality, unbiased data from lightweight models with minimal seeds, and the lack of specific technical formulations for metrics like 'domain representativeness'. The claim of 'up to 50% reduction' in labeling costs needs stronger justification or preliminary evidence."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technologies (lightweight generative models, AL frameworks, quantization tools). It acknowledges resource constraints and proposes mitigation strategies. However, implementation presents moderate challenges. Integrating all components (generation, AL, optimization) into a robust and efficient pipeline requires significant engineering effort and experimentation. Acquiring even 'minimal' relevant local data seeds might be difficult in some target regions. The success hinges on the quality of the lightweight generator and the effectiveness of the AL strategy, which carry inherent risks. The 50% cost reduction target seems ambitious and adds to the implementation risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and well-recognized problem: the difficulty of applying advanced ML in low-resource developing regions due to data scarcity and computational limitations. By aiming to create context-aware, efficient ML solutions, SynDA has the potential to democratize ML and enable impactful applications in vital sectors like healthcare, agriculture, and education within these regions. Success would represent a substantial contribution to the field of practical ML for development and could lead to tangible societal benefits."
