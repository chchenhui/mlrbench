    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges of low-resource ML outlined in the task (data scarcity, compute constraints, domain mismatch) using the suggested methods (data generation, active learning, model compression). It elaborates clearly on the research idea (SynDA framework, lightweight synthesis, prompt-guidance, hybrid AL). Furthermore, it effectively situates itself within the provided literature, referencing relevant works (Kimmich et al., Chen et al.) and explicitly aiming to tackle the identified key challenges like domain mismatch, annotation cost, and computational limits. The proposed solutions directly map to the topics encouraged by the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes), making it easy to follow. Research objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology section provides detailed descriptions of the proposed components (TinySynth, prompt-guided generation, quantization, proxy-based active learning, composite score) with supporting mathematical formulations and an algorithm outline. The experimental design is well-articulated, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Expected outcomes and impact are clearly presented. While minor details could always be added, the proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While combining synthetic data and active learning isn't entirely new (as shown in the literature review, e.g., Kimmich et al.), the novelty lies in the specific *integration* tailored for low-resource, developing region contexts. Key novel aspects include: 1) The focus on *lightweight* generative models (TinySynth via distillation/NAS) combined with *contextual prompt-guidance* from local experts to ensure both efficiency and domain relevance. 2) The specific hybrid active learning strategy combining uncertainty and *domain representativeness* using *proxy networks* for efficiency. 3) The holistic framework (SynDA) addressing data scarcity, labeling cost, computational constraints (including edge deployment), and domain mismatch simultaneously for this specific application area. It offers a fresh configuration of existing ideas targeted effectively."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (generative models, active learning, model compression). The proposed methodology (distilled diffusion/TinyGANs, prompt conditioning, quantization, uncertainty/representativeness sampling, proxy models) uses established techniques. Mathematical formulations are appropriate and correctly presented. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, metrics (covering performance, efficiency, fairness), and ablation studies. Potential challenges (quality of lightweight synthesis, proxy accuracy) are implicitly acknowledged by the experimental plan, but the core approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The individual technical components (lightweight model training, active learning implementation, quantization) are achievable with existing tools and expertise. The required seed data seems manageable for low-resource settings. However, achieving high-quality, contextually relevant synthetic data from *lightweight* models with *minimal* seed data might be difficult. Effective prompt engineering requires significant local expert collaboration. Reaching ambitious edge performance targets (e.g., 15 FPS on RPi4 for generation) will require careful optimization and may pose difficulties. Access to consistent local expert input for prompts and annotation could also be a practical hurdle. Overall, it's feasible but carries moderate implementation risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and widely recognized problem of deploying ML effectively in resource-constrained developing regions, directly aligning with the task's goal of democratizing ML. The potential impact is substantial: scientifically (novel framework, open-source contributions), technologically (reduced labeling costs, edge deployment enablement), and societally (addressing SDGs in agriculture/healthcare, capacity building). By tackling multiple key bottlenecks (data, cost, compute, relevance) simultaneously, the SynDA framework, if successful, could provide a transformative toolkit for practitioners in these regions."
