        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on 'solving inverse problems' and 'science and engineering applications' using diffusion models, which are the core focus of this proposal. It also touches upon related topics like 'conditional generation', 'probabilistic inference', and potentially 'novel training methodology or architectures'. The idea directly addresses the workshop's goal of exploring recent advances and applications of diffusion models in challenging domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (ambiguity in inverse problems), the core proposal (diffusion framework with latent space for ambiguity, hybrid sampling), and expected outcomes (diverse, plausible solutions for CT/microscopy) are well-defined. Key technical components like cross-attention and likelihood-aware loss are mentioned. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact structure of the latent space or the specifics of the hybrid sampling, but the overall concept is understandable and precise enough for evaluation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While using diffusion models for inverse problems is an active research area, the specific focus on explicitly modeling ambiguity to generate *multiple distinct* plausible solutions using a dedicated latent space combined with physics-informed hybrid sampling appears novel. It moves beyond single-point estimates or simple variance estimation, aiming for multi-modal posterior approximation within the diffusion framework. It offers a fresh perspective on handling inherent ambiguity in scientific imaging tasks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Conditional diffusion models, cross-attention, and latent variable models are established techniques. However, implementing the specific latent space design to capture ambiguity modes effectively, developing the hybrid sampling strategy incorporating physics priors, and training potentially large models on complex scientific data (like medical CT) present moderate challenges. Access to suitable datasets and computational resources is necessary. Overall, it's achievable but requires significant research and engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Inverse problems are fundamental in many critical scientific and medical fields. Ambiguity is often a key challenge, limiting the reliability of reconstructions. Providing a method to generate a diverse set of high-fidelity, plausible solutions, rather than just one, could significantly improve diagnostic confidence in medicine, enhance scientific discovery by exploring alternative hypotheses, and advance uncertainty quantification. Successfully bridging advanced generative modeling with rigorous scientific problem-solving holds substantial potential impact."
