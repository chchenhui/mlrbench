    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for contributions on 'improving existing benchmarks and evaluation methods to rigorously assess cognitive abilities in LLMs' and focuses on tasks like 'reasoning, navigation, planning, and theory of mind'. The proposed Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark directly addresses this by offering a novel evaluation method specifically targeting planning, navigation, and theory-of-mind, aiming to understand the emergence of these cognitive abilities. It also touches upon comparing different LLM architectures ('fine‚Äêtuned vs. modular architectures'), another topic listed in the call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is straightforward, and the main components of the proposed benchmark (dynamic curriculum, algorithmic generation, RL-based sampling, specific cognitive domains, adaptive difficulty, emergence point estimation, human validation) are clearly listed. The expected outcomes are also well-defined. While specific implementation details (e.g., the exact nature of the RL sampler or task generation algorithms) are not fully elaborated, the overall concept and approach are understandable with only minor ambiguities expected at the idea stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While curriculum learning and adaptive testing are established concepts, applying them systematically via an algorithmically generated, dynamic benchmark specifically to probe the *emergence thresholds* of complex cognitive abilities like planning and ToM in LLMs is innovative. Using RL-based task samplers for this purpose adds another layer of novelty. It combines existing ideas in a fresh way to address a specific challenge in LLM evaluation, moving beyond static benchmarks. It's not entirely groundbreaking in its individual components but offers a novel synthesis and application."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Algorithmically generating simple planning and navigation tasks is achievable. Generating increasingly complex and nuanced tasks, especially for theory-of-mind, automatically could be difficult and require sophisticated methods (potentially leveraging LLMs themselves). Implementing and tuning an RL-based task sampler requires specific expertise. Evaluating success automatically for complex tasks can be non-trivial. Accessing and running diverse LLMs requires significant computational resources. Human-in-the-loop validation adds overhead but increases robustness. Overall, it's feasible within a well-resourced research project but requires careful engineering and design."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding how and when cognitive abilities like planning and ToM emerge in LLMs is a central question in AI research, directly relevant to the workshop's theme. Current static benchmarks often fail to capture the nuances of this emergence or provide fine-grained comparisons. A dynamic benchmark could offer much deeper insights into LLM capabilities, limitations, and developmental trajectories, potentially guiding future model design and training strategies towards more robust higher-order reasoning and social cognition. The focus on core cognitive abilities enhances its importance."
