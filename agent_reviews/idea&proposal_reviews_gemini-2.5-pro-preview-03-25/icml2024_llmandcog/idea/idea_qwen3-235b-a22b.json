        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central goal of assessing LLMs' cognitive abilities within the landscape of intelligence. Specifically, it tackles the listed topic comparing mechanistic interpretability in AI and neuroscience to understand similarities/differences between LLMs and human brains regarding cognitive functions (reasoning, theory of mind). It also implicitly relates to evaluating LLM performance on cognitive tasks and potentially improving evaluation methods through its proposed framework."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main proposal (adapting neuropsychological techniques like lesion studies to LLMs and comparing with human fMRI), methodology (ablating components, measuring performance degradation, parallel human studies), and expected outcomes (taxonomy of components, comparison of pathways) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It is immediately understandable what the research aims to achieve and how."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While comparing LLMs and cognition or using interpretability methods is not new, the proposed *unified framework* that systematically adapts specific neuropsychological techniques (lesion studies, functional connectivity analysis) to LLM components (attention heads, MLPs) and directly correlates findings with parallel human neuroimaging (fMRI) data for specific cognitive tasks represents a fresh and innovative cross-disciplinary approach. It moves beyond surface-level analogies towards a more mechanistic comparison."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The LLM-focused aspects (ablating components, running cognitive tasks, measuring performance) are technically achievable with standard ML resources. However, the requirement for parallel fMRI studies in humans performing analogous tasks introduces considerable complexity and resource requirements (access to fMRI scanners, participant recruitment, ethical approvals, neuroscience expertise, significant funding). Aligning tasks perfectly across humans and models, and meaningfully comparing fMRI activation patterns with LLM component ablation effects, poses non-trivial methodological hurdles. Therefore, while conceptually sound, the practical implementation requires substantial resources and interdisciplinary collaboration, making it only satisfactorily feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of cognition in LLMs and comparing them to human neural processes is a fundamental challenge in AI and cognitive science. This research could provide crucial insights into whether LLMs develop convergent cognitive strategies, reveal their limitations, and offer a more rigorous way to benchmark their cognitive abilities beyond task performance. Findings could directly inform the design of more robust, interpretable, and potentially human-aligned AI systems, addressing critical questions about the nature of intelligence."
