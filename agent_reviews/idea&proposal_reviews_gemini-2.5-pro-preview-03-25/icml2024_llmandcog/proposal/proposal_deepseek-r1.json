    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on LLM cognitive abilities (planning, ToM, navigation), the need for improved benchmarks, and the comparison between fine-tuned and augmented LLMs. The proposed Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB) directly operationalizes the research idea, and the methodology incorporates concepts and addresses challenges (adaptive benchmarking, emergence, modular architectures like Hypothetical Minds, human validation) highlighted in the provided literature."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the DCB framework, including the RL algorithm, experimental design, models, metrics, and validation protocol. The structure is logical and easy to follow. A minor point of ambiguity exists regarding the exact mechanism and timing of integrating human-validated partial success into the RL reward signal versus post-hoc validation, but overall, the proposal is well-articulated and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While benchmarking LLM cognition is an active area (e.g., CogBench), the core idea of a *dynamic* curriculum driven by an RL-based task sampler that adapts difficulty based on LLM performance specifically for evaluating emergent planning and ToM appears innovative. This adaptive methodology moves beyond static benchmarks and offers a more nuanced way to probe cognitive emergence thresholds. The integration of planning, navigation, and ToM within this single adaptive framework also adds to its novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on established concepts in LLM evaluation, cognitive science (planning, ToM), and reinforcement learning. The proposed methodology, including procedural task generation, the contextual bandit formulation for task selection, and the experimental design (comparing model types, using relevant metrics, human validation with inter-rater reliability), is generally well-justified. Referencing relevant techniques like probing hidden states adds to the technical depth. Minor potential weaknesses lie in the practical challenge of defining 'partial success' consistently and ensuring the RL agent converges robustly."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. It requires significant computational resources (multiple large LLMs, GPU infrastructure), expertise in diverse areas (LLMs, RL, cognitive task design, human annotation), and potentially costly API access or collaborations for proprietary models/architectures. Developing the task generators and the RL sampler, and managing the human validation loop, presents moderate implementation challenges. While technically achievable with sufficient resources and expertise, the scope might require careful management or phasing. Risks related to RL convergence and model access exist but seem manageable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the limitations of current static benchmarks in evaluating the emergent cognitive abilities of increasingly complex LLMs. Developing a robust, adaptive framework like the DCB has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of AI cognition, provide clearer comparisons between different model architectures (monolithic vs. modular), guide future AI development towards more robust reasoning, and contribute to safer AI deployment by better characterizing model capabilities and limitations, especially in social reasoning (ToM)."
