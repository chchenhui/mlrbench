    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on evaluating LLM cognitive abilities (planning, ToM, navigation), comparing architectures (fine-tuned vs. modular), and improving benchmarks. The proposal meticulously builds upon the provided research idea, elaborating on the Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB) concept. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles the key challenges identified in the literature review (adaptive benchmarking, emergence identification, long-horizon context, hallucination, human validation) and appropriately cites the reviewed papers to motivate its objectives and methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides substantial detail on task domains, the RL-based dynamic curriculum algorithm (including equations and reward function), the benchmarking pipeline, evaluation metrics, human-in-the-loop validation process (mentioning Dawid-Skene), and the model comparison strategy. The structure is logical and easy to follow, progressing smoothly from introduction to conclusion. There is minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While curriculum learning and RL are established techniques, their application to create a *dynamic, adaptive benchmark* specifically for evaluating the *emergence* of higher-order cognitive skills (planning, ToM, navigation) in LLMs is innovative. It contrasts clearly with existing static benchmarks mentioned (like CogBench). The integration of RL for difficulty scaling, specific cognitive task domains, and structured human-in-the-loop validation within a unified framework represents a fresh approach to LLM evaluation in this context."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and methodologically rigorous. It is well-grounded in relevant literature (cited appropriately) and established techniques (RL - specifically mentioning PPO/REINFORCE, Bayesian optimization, Dawid-Skene). The task domains are pertinent to the cognitive abilities under investigation. The proposed RL mechanism for curriculum adaptation, while complex, is theoretically plausible. The inclusion of both automatic metrics and human validation strengthens the evaluation plan. Planned ablation studies further enhance the rigor. Technical formulations (equations, metrics) are mostly clear and appropriate for a proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Developing and tuning the RL-based curriculum sampler across three distinct cognitive domains is complex. Generating diverse, meaningful tasks that scale appropriately in difficulty algorithmically is non-trivial. The plan requires significant computational resources for running multiple large LLMs through potentially long curricula and human resources for audits. Access to state-of-the-art models and managing the human validation pipeline add complexity. While ambitious, it's achievable with a well-resourced team, but the risks associated with RL stability and effective task generation are substantial."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the limitations of static benchmarks in evaluating the emergent cognitive capabilities of rapidly evolving LLMs. Understanding how skills like planning and ToM develop, and comparing different architectures (fine-tuned vs. modular) dynamically, offers substantial value. The proposed DCB could become a standard tool, providing granular cognitive profiles, informing LLM architecture design, contributing to AI alignment efforts by better understanding model capabilities and failure modes (like hallucination), and potentially offering insights relevant to cognitive science."
