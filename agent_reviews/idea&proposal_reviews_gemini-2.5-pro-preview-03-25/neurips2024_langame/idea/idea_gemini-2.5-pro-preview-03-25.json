        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of 'Language Gamification' for interactive LLM finetuning. It proposes using a multi-agent language game ('Persuasion Game') involving LLMs, motivated by the need to improve planning and reasoning abilities, which are explicitly mentioned limitations LLMs face due to lack of interaction in standard training. Furthermore, the proposed method falls squarely under the workshop topic 'Deep Reinforcement Learning: Showcasing RL approaches that leverage language games to foster planning and reasoning abilities'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (LLM planning limitations), the main concept (adversarial language game using DRL), the setup (Planner vs. Skeptic LLMs), the interaction mechanism (dialogue for persuasion/justification), and the expected outcome (improved planning/reasoning). The roles of the agents and the reward principle are explicitly stated. While specific implementation details (e.g., exact reward function formulation, nature of the 'plans') are not fully elaborated, this is expected for a research idea summary. The core concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using RL and multi-agent setups for LLMs isn't entirely new, the specific formulation of the 'Persuasion Game' – an adversarial dialogue focused explicitly on validating and refining *plans* where one agent must convince another – is innovative. It moves beyond general preference alignment (like RLHF) or simple collaborative/competitive task completion. The focus on adversarial interaction to specifically drive improvements in planning, justification, and logical coherence through a structured game offers a fresh perspective on interactive LLM training."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. LLMs can participate in dialogue, and RL frameworks can be applied. However, implementing the adversarial RL loop effectively requires careful design of the state space, action space (dialogue moves), and especially the reward function (measuring successful persuasion and flaw detection accurately). Training two interacting LLMs via RL can be computationally intensive. Ensuring stable training and avoiding degenerate strategies (e.g., Skeptic always disagreeing, Planner finding trivial ways to 'win') will require significant engineering effort. Nonetheless, the core components are available, making it achievable with dedicated resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it targets a critical and widely recognized limitation of current LLMs: their deficiency in complex planning and robust reasoning. Improving these capabilities would represent a major advancement, enabling LLMs to tackle more sophisticated tasks reliably. The proposed method, by grounding planning in interactive justification and adversarial scrutiny, could lead to more logically coherent and trustworthy AI systems. Success would have substantial impact across various applications requiring planning, from autonomous agents to complex problem-solving assistants."
