        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core concept of 'Language Gamification' by proposing interactive training through language games. It explicitly targets the LLM limitation in planning mentioned in the task motivation and aligns perfectly with the 'Deep Reinforcement Learning' topic, which specifically calls for 'RL approaches that leverage language games to foster planning and reasoning abilities'. The use of multi-agent interactions and self-play also fits well within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (LLM planning deficit), the proposed solution (multi-agent RL framework with language games), the key components (game suite, self-play, reward system), and the expected outcomes (enhanced planning skills). The connection between the problem, method, and goal is logical and easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using RL, multi-agent systems, and games for AI training exists, the specific proposal to use structured, planning-focused *language games* within a multi-agent self-play framework to enhance *LLM planning capabilities* is innovative. It combines concepts from Deep RL, Language Emergence, and Multi-Agent Learning in a fresh way to address a specific LLM weakness, moving beyond typical RLHF applications focused on alignment or style."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Implementing multi-agent RL with large LLMs is computationally intensive. Designing effective language games that progressively train complex planning skills and defining robust reward functions that capture planning success (beyond simple task completion or fluency) are non-trivial research problems. Self-play dynamics also need careful management. However, it builds upon existing technologies and methodologies, making it achievable within a well-resourced research context, albeit requiring considerable effort and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Enhancing the planning capabilities of LLMs is a critical challenge in AI, and success would unlock major advancements in complex reasoning, problem-solving, and the development of more reliable AI assistants. Addressing this via interactive, game-based learning could lead to more robust and adaptable models, potentially influencing future LLM training paradigms. The potential impact on the field is substantial."
