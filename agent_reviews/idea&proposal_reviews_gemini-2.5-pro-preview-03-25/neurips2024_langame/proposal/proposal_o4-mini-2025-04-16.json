        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Language Gamification' theme by proposing an interactive LLM finetuning method based on a language game. The core idea of using an adversarial 'Persuasion Game' with DRL to enhance planning and reasoning aligns perfectly with the research idea and fits squarely within the workshop topics (DRL, language games for planning/reasoning). The methodology leverages concepts (adversarial interaction, RL for planning) discussed in the provided literature review (e.g., Son et al., Johnson & Brown, Red & Yellow, Purple & Orange). The objectives and significance clearly connect back to the motivation derived from the task description regarding LLM limitations and the potential of interactive training."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology (game setup, RL formulation, reward structure, experimental design), and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. The use of mathematical notation for the RL objective is appropriate and clear. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for the co-trained Skeptic's objective function (how 'plan quality' is measured independently) and the exact nature of the 'reference proof' for the coherence reward, but these do not significantly hinder the overall comprehension of the proposed research. The structure is logical and facilitates understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like using RL for planning (Son et al., Shi et al.), adversarial training (Johnson & Brown), and interactive LLM training (Green & Blue, Purple & Orange) exist, the specific formulation of an adversarial 'Persuasion Game' between two LLMs (Planner vs. Skeptic) trained via DRL explicitly to improve multi-step planning and justification appears novel. It distinguishes itself from cooperative games (White & Black) and human-in-the-loop methods (Green & Blue, SRLM). The framing of planning as a persuasive dialogue game offers a fresh perspective compared to existing literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds on solid theoretical foundations in RL (PPO, GAE) and aligns with cognitive science concepts (language games). The proposed methodology, including the Markov game formulation, policy gradient approach, and reward components, is generally well-defined and technically appropriate. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and evaluation metrics. Minor weaknesses include the slight vagueness in the co-trained Skeptic's objective function and the potential challenges in defining a robust 'coherence reward' metric based on LLM scoring. However, the overall technical approach is well-justified and methodologically sound."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. Implementing and training LLMs in an interactive, multi-agent RL setting is computationally intensive, a risk acknowledged by the authors with reasonable mitigation strategies (transfer learning, starting small). Designing effective reward functions and ensuring the Skeptic provides meaningful, non-exploitable adversarial pressure (especially if co-trained) requires careful engineering and tuning. Data collection for real-world tasks and human evaluation are standard but require resources. Overall, while demanding, the project is feasible within a well-equipped research environment using current technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation of current LLMs: robust multi-step planning and reasoning. Improving these capabilities would unlock LLM applications in complex domains (robotics, decision support). The proposed 'language gamification' approach offers a potentially scalable, self-supervised interactive finetuning paradigm beyond static training and RLHF. Success would not only advance LLM capabilities but also provide empirical insights into the role of adversarial interaction in developing reasoning skills, connecting AI research with cognitive science theories. The potential contributions are substantial."
