    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Language Gamification' theme by proposing an interactive, multi-agent (Planner vs. Skeptic) DRL framework to improve LLM planning and reasoning, which is a key focus of the task. The 'Planning via Persuasion' idea is faithfully translated into the proposal's methodology. The approach leverages concepts like DRL, adversarial interaction, and planning improvement, which are well-represented in the provided literature review and fit the workshop's topics (DRL, Multi-Agent Learning, planning/reasoning)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear in its overall structure, objectives, and the core concept of the Planner-Skeptic game. The algorithmic steps provide a high-level overview. However, crucial details lack clarity. The reward function R is abstractly defined as f(Feasibility, Correctness, Justification) without specifying how these are assessed by the Skeptic or combined. Most importantly, the mathematical formulation for the Skeptic's policy update (using the Planner's reward R) seems counter-intuitive for an adversary and is not adequately explained or justified, creating significant ambiguity about the learning dynamics. Details on data generation/sourcing and the measurement of 'Logical Coherence' are also vague."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using DRL, LLMs, and adversarial setups exists in the literature (as shown in the review), the specific formulation of the 'Persuasion Game' – where a Planner LLM must interactively justify its plan to an adversarial Skeptic LLM trained via DRL – is a novel approach to improving planning and reasoning. It distinctively combines multi-agent interaction, adversarial learning, and DRL within a language game context specifically designed for plan validation and refinement, going beyond standard imitation or preference learning."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is conceptually sound, grounding itself in DRL principles and the plausible idea that adversarial interaction can drive improvement. The experimental design includes relevant comparisons and evaluations. However, there is a significant weakness in the technical formulation, specifically the Skeptic's update rule using the Planner's reward `R`. This is either incorrect for an adversarial setting or requires substantial clarification, casting doubt on the rigor of the proposed learning mechanism. The vagueness of the reward function `R` definition also detracts from the soundness. While the overall DRL approach is standard, these specific formulation issues are critical."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Training two LLMs interactively via DRL is computationally expensive and technically complex, requiring significant expertise. Ensuring stable convergence in an adversarial multi-agent setting is notoriously difficult. Designing an effective reward function and training the Skeptic to provide meaningful, non-trivial challenges are significant hurdles. While conceptually possible with current technology, the practical implementation requires careful engineering, substantial resources, and carries non-trivial risks regarding training stability and achieving the desired agent behaviors."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the limitations of LLMs in multi-step planning and reasoning. Improving these capabilities is crucial for advancing AI. The proposed interactive, adversarial training paradigm offers a potentially impactful alternative to current methods. If successful, it could lead to more robust, coherent, and justifiable LLMs, advancing the state-of-the-art and enabling better performance in complex tasks across various applications (dialogue, agents, recommendations). The research aligns well with the important trend of exploring interactive training for LLMs."
