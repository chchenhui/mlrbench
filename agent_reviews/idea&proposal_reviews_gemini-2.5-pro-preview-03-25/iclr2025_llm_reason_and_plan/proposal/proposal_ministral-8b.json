    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses Topic 2 ('Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks') and the scope item 'Efficient inference for complex reasoning tasks' from the workshop description by proposing a method for dynamic resource allocation during inference for planning. The methodology and objectives perfectly match the provided research idea (Adaptive Inference Planner using meta-reasoning and RL). It also clearly builds upon concepts and addresses challenges identified in the literature review, such as adaptive planning (AdaPlanner), dynamic resource allocation (LLM-RAO, papers 5-10), and the need to balance efficiency and performance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, overall methodology (RL, meta-reasoning, datasets, evaluation plan), and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details of the meta-reasoning component (how difficulty is assessed) and the precise mechanisms for adjusting computational resources (e.g., specific parameters tuned like inference steps, model calls, beam width - these were mentioned in the idea but not detailed in the methodology section). However, these details are often elaborated upon during the actual research, and the proposal provides a strong conceptual outline."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. The core idea of adaptive computation/inference for LLMs is present in the literature review (e.g., AdaLLaVA, papers 5-10). However, the specific application to *planning tasks* using a *meta-reasoning component trained via RL* to dynamically assess *step-wise difficulty* and allocate resources accordingly offers a potentially novel integration or refinement of existing concepts. While not groundbreaking, it distinguishes itself from AdaPlanner (feedback-based refinement) and LLM-RAO (wireless resource allocation). The existence of several very closely titled papers (5-10) in the literature review, even without full details, suggests the area is actively explored, somewhat limiting the perceived originality. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and application focus rather than a fundamentally new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is based on solid theoretical foundations (LLMs, planning, RL, meta-reasoning) and proposes established methods (RL for policy learning, standard benchmarks like ALFWorld). The mathematical formulation for the reward function is appropriate for the stated goal of balancing quality and cost. The experimental design includes necessary components like baseline comparison and relevant metrics. Minor gaps exist in specifying precisely how the meta-reasoner will assess 'difficulty' and how 'computational cost' will be measured, which are crucial for implementation but don't undermine the fundamental soundness of the approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on existing technologies (SOTA LLMs, RL frameworks) and datasets (ALFWorld, MiniWoB++). The plan is logical. However, implementing and training the meta-reasoning component via RL presents moderate technical challenges. It requires significant computational resources for training the RL agent and potentially fine-tuning the base LLM. Ensuring the meta-reasoner is effective without adding excessive overhead is a key challenge. Generalization across diverse tasks might also require careful tuning and potentially more sophisticated methods. Overall, it's ambitious but achievable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Improving the computational efficiency of LLMs during complex reasoning and planning tasks is a critical challenge for scaling these models to real-world applications. Successfully developing the AIP could lead to substantial improvements in inference speed for simpler tasks and better performance on complex ones, making LLM-based planning more practical and cost-effective. This directly addresses a key focus area of the workshop and the broader AI community, with potential applications beyond planning to other resource-intensive LLM tasks."
