    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop goals), the research idea (AIP concept), and the literature review. It explicitly references workshop topics (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and explains how the research contributes to them. It accurately positions the AIP idea relative to the cited works (AdaPlanner, LLM-DP, AdaLLaVA, preprints), clearly identifying the gap it aims to fill â€“ a comprehensive framework integrating learnable meta-reasoning and RL for dynamic allocation of diverse computational resources within LLM planning. The proposal directly addresses the key challenges outlined in the literature review, such as dynamic allocation complexity and balancing efficiency/performance."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-defined, and logically structured. The objectives, methodology (including AIP architecture, meta-reasoning options, RL formulation, resource types), and evaluation plan are articulated effectively. Key concepts are explained, and mathematical sketches aid understanding. Minor ambiguities exist regarding specific implementation choices (e.g., exact LLM model, specific neural network architecture for meta-reasoning), which is acceptable at the proposal stage, but the overall research plan and rationale are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While adaptive inference, meta-reasoning, and RL for optimizing LLMs are existing research trends (acknowledged through the literature review, especially the preprints), the novelty lies in the specific, integrated framework (AIP) proposed. This framework combines a learnable meta-reasoning component to predict step difficulty with an RL agent controlling a diverse set of computational resources (steps, CoT, beam width, tools, model selection) specifically tailored for the LLM's internal planning generation process. It offers a fresh perspective by synthesizing these elements into a cohesive system for planning, distinguishing itself from prior work focusing on external feedback (AdaPlanner) or integration with symbolic planners (LLM-DP)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established principles of LLMs, meta-reasoning (uncertainty estimation, auxiliary tasks), and reinforcement learning (PPO/DQN). The proposed methodology, including the AIP architecture, potential meta-reasoning techniques, RL formulation (state, action, reward structure), and resource dimensions, is technically well-founded. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant baselines, standard benchmarks, appropriate metrics, and planned ablation studies. Potential challenges, such as the complexity of training the meta-reasoning module and tuning the RL reward function, are implicitly acknowledged but the overall approach is robust and justifiable."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Successfully implementing AIP requires substantial computational resources (for LLM inference and extensive RL training), access to suitable LLMs, and considerable engineering effort to integrate the meta-reasoning and RL control loop within the LLM inference process. Training the meta-reasoning component reliably and tuning the complex RL reward function effectively are non-trivial tasks. While the individual technical components exist, their integration and optimization in this specific context make the project ambitious and resource-intensive. The plan is plausible but carries moderate execution risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the practical application of LLMs: computational efficiency and performance scaling for complex reasoning tasks like planning (directly relevant to Workshop Topic 2). Improving the cost-effectiveness and capability of LLM planning could unlock wider adoption in various domains (robotics, automation, decision support). The research has the potential to make substantial contributions to the field of adaptive inference, meta-reasoning within LLMs, and RL for optimizing large models, aligning strongly with the workshop's core themes and addressing key challenges identified in the literature."
