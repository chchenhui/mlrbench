        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses the workshop's core themes, particularly Topic 2: 'Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks'. It explicitly proposes a method for dynamic resource allocation during inference to optimize reasoning, using RL as mentioned in Topic 1. It aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on efficient inference techniques for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented very clearly. It outlines the motivation (inefficiency of uniform computation), the proposed two-stage hierarchical framework (planner + adaptive execution pathways), the training mechanism (RL for the planner), and the specific architectural element (sparse MoE with RL gating). The expected outcomes and target benchmarks are also specified, making the proposal well-defined and easily understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines several existing concepts (hierarchical processing, adaptive computation, Mixture-of-Experts, RL for optimization) in a novel way specifically for LLM reasoning efficiency. While adaptive computation and MoE are not new, applying a dedicated RL-trained planner module to route tasks between different computational pathways (shallow vs. deep/MoE) based on complexity, latency, and cost for LLM reasoning offers a notable degree of originality. It's a clever synthesis rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach relies on established techniques like RL, MoE architectures, and standard LLM backbones. Implementing a lightweight planner and integrating it with different computational pathways is technically feasible. Training the RL agent effectively to balance accuracy, latency, and cost might pose challenges (reward design, exploration). Integrating sparse MoE efficiently adds complexity. Achieving the ambitious 30-50% speedup while maintaining accuracy requires careful engineering and tuning, but the overall concept is implementable within current ML research capabilities, assuming access to necessary computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "Improving inference efficiency for complex LLM reasoning tasks is a critical challenge with significant practical implications. Reducing latency and computational cost while maintaining accuracy could enable wider deployment of powerful LLMs in resource-constrained or real-time applications (robotics, interactive agents). Success in this area would represent a major advancement, making state-of-the-art reasoning more accessible and sustainable. The focus on established reasoning benchmarks adds to its relevance."
