    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses Topic 2, 'Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks', particularly the question of how models can dynamically allocate resources during inference. It incorporates 'Uncertainty' (Topic 5) as a core mechanism for guiding inference. The use of reinforcement learning for the gating policy aligns with the workshop's interest in RL methods (Topic 1). The motivation concerning efficiency for multi-step reasoning fits perfectly with the workshop's focus. The mention of extending to multi-modal planning also touches upon Topic 4. Overall, the idea fits squarely within the workshop's scope and key themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (two-tiered inference guided by uncertainty), key components (estimator, proxy, full LLM, RL gate), target benchmarks, and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The overall pipeline is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architecture of the uncertainty estimator, the nature of the 'compact LLM proxy', and the precise formulation of the RL problem (state/action space, reward function), but these are details that would typically be elaborated in a full paper. The core idea is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While adaptive computation, uncertainty estimation, and using smaller proxy models are known concepts, their specific combination and application here are innovative. Applying step-wise uncertainty estimation within a chain-of-thought process to dynamically switch between a compact proxy and a full LLM, governed by an RL-trained policy, represents a fresh approach to efficient LLM reasoning. It moves beyond static model compression or simple early exiting by proposing a more fine-grained, context-aware dynamic allocation strategy specifically for reasoning tasks."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Training uncertainty estimators, using smaller proxy models (e.g., distilled or smaller pre-trained models), and applying reinforcement learning are all established techniques within ML. Access to LLMs and reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K/HotpotQA is standard. However, implementation challenges exist: designing an effective and truly lightweight uncertainty estimator, ensuring the proxy model generates useful continuations, and successfully training the RL gating policy (which often requires careful reward engineering and significant computation) present moderate hurdles. Significant engineering effort would be required, but no fundamental roadblocks seem apparent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. It addresses the critical bottleneck of high computational cost and latency for complex, multi-step reasoning in large language models. Achieving 2-5x speedups with minimal accuracy loss, as hypothesized, would be a major practical contribution, enabling wider deployment of advanced LLM reasoning capabilities in resource-constrained or real-time scenarios (e.g., interactive agents, edge devices). The focus on adaptive inference is highly relevant given the trend towards larger models. Success would represent a meaningful advancement in efficient AI."
