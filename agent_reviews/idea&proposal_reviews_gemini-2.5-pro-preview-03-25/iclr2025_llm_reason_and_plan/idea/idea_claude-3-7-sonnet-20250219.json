        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses Topic 2 ('Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks'), specifically the question 'How can models dynamically allocate resources during inference to optimize for reasoning and planning?'. It also strongly aligns with Topic 4 ('Multi-modality and Embodiment in LLMs'), focusing on enhancing multi-modal reasoning and addressing challenges in applying LLMs to multi-modal tasks. The emphasis on computational efficiency and reasoning in multi-modal settings fits perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-defined. The motivation (inefficiency in static resource allocation for multi-modal LLMs) is explicit. The proposed solution (adaptive attention with Modal Resource Gates) and its key components (importance estimator, cross-modal pathways, resource scheduler) are clearly outlined. The evaluation strategy is also mentioned. While the precise mechanism of the 'Modal Resource Gates' and 'information density estimation' could be further elaborated, the overall concept is well-articulated and understandable for a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While dynamic computation and attention mechanisms exist, the specific proposal of 'Modal Resource Gates' (MRGs) designed to dynamically allocate computational budget *across modalities* based on information density and task phase within LLMs appears innovative. It moves beyond simple modality weighting towards active resource management during inference for multi-modal reasoning. This specific mechanism tailored for multi-modal LL efficiency represents a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible using current machine learning techniques. Implementing attention mechanisms, gating functions, and cross-modal interactions are established practices. Estimating information density and designing a task-aware scheduler are challenging but achievable engineering tasks. Access to suitable multi-modal datasets and significant computational resources for training would be necessary, which is standard for LLM research. The core technical components are grounded in existing methods, making implementation practical, albeit potentially complex."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant as it addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying large multi-modal models: computational efficiency during complex reasoning. Improving dynamic resource allocation could lead to substantial gains in inference speed, reduced costs, and enable the application of powerful models to resource-constrained or real-time scenarios (e.g., robotics, interactive agents). Success in this area would represent a major advancement for practical multi-modal AI, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the workshop description."
