        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea perfectly aligns with the task description. It directly addresses the need for 'new statistical tools for the era of black-box models' by focusing on 'Conformal prediction and other black-box uncertainty quantification techniques'. Furthermore, it targets the operational risks associated with foundation models under distribution shifts, directly relating to 'Auditing, safety, and risk analysis'. The motivation explicitly links the failure of standard statistical assumptions (exchangeability) in black-box models to deployment risks, matching the task's core concerns."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is very clear and well-defined. It clearly states the problem (brittleness of standard CP under shift), the proposed solution (adaptive CP framework), the key technical components (online drift detection, dynamic score adjustment, theoretical guarantees using time-decaying influence functions), and the validation strategy (vision/language models, specific shift types). The expected outcome (robust, certified uncertainty intervals) is unambiguous. Minor details about the exact mechanism of the time-decaying influence functions could be elaborated, but overall the proposal is highly understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While conformal prediction under distribution shift is an existing research area, this proposal integrates several components in a potentially novel way: combining online drift detection (e.g., MMD) with dynamic adjustment mechanisms (importance weighting, domain adaptation) specifically for black-box foundation models, and aiming for theoretical guarantees using time-decaying influence functions. This specific combination, particularly the focus on adaptive guarantees under continuous drift for large foundation models, offers a fresh perspective compared to standard or static covariate shift CP methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core components (drift detection, importance weighting, conformal prediction) are based on existing techniques. However, integrating these into an efficient online system, accurately estimating and adapting to complex shifts in high-dimensional data from foundation models, and deriving tight, practical theoretical guarantees under drift will require significant technical effort and potentially large computational resources for validation. The success hinges on the effective integration and theoretical derivation, which are non-trivial research tasks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Reliable uncertainty quantification for foundation models, especially under the common scenario of distribution shift, is a critical bottleneck for their safe and trustworthy deployment in real-world applications (e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving). Providing theoretically grounded, robust uncertainty estimates that adapt to changing environments would be a major contribution to AI safety, auditability, and risk management, directly addressing a key challenge highlighted in the task description."
