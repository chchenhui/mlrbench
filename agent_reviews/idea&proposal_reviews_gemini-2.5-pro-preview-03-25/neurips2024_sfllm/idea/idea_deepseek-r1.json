        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for 'new statistical tools for the era of black-box models' and lists 'Conformal prediction and other black-box uncertainty quantification techniques' as a key topic. The idea directly proposes an adaptive conformal prediction framework for black-box LLMs, addressing uncertainty quantification to mitigate operational risks, which is the central theme of the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly defines the problem (UQ for black-box LLMs), the motivation (high-stakes applications, limitations of existing methods), and the proposed solution (adaptive CP with proxy scores, calibration, online updates). The validation plan and expected outcomes are also outlined. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise derivation and availability of certain 'proxy nonconformity scores' (e.g., attention entropy, embedding dispersion) from typical black-box APIs, and the exact mechanism for using 'API rate limits' for online updates could be more detailed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While conformal prediction is an existing field, applying it adaptively to black-box LLMs without assuming exchangeability presents significant challenges. The core novelty lies in using *proxy* nonconformity scores derived from observable outputs combined with adaptive calibration and online updates specifically tailored to handle potential distribution shifts in LLM outputs. This combination represents a fresh approach compared to standard CP or simpler black-box UQ methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces implementation challenges. Its strength lies in avoiding the need for model internals. However, feasibility depends heavily on whether the proposed 'observable outputs' (beyond token probabilities) are actually accessible via common black-box LLM APIs. Deriving meaningful proxy scores from limited outputs is a research challenge. Furthermore, the effectiveness of online updates based on indirect signals like API rate limits or potentially sparse user feedback needs empirical validation. Significant effort might be required to demonstrate robust performance across different APIs and tasks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Reliable uncertainty quantification for powerful but opaque LLMs is a critical bottleneck for their safe deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law. Developing statistically rigorous methods that work under black-box constraints directly addresses a major real-world need and aligns with the task's focus on safety and risk analysis. Success would represent a major advancement in trustworthy AI, potentially enabling wider adoption of LLMs where reliability is paramount."
