        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly calls for new statistical tools for black-box LLMs, highlighting 'Conformal prediction and other black-box uncertainty quantification techniques' and 'Auditing, safety, and risk analysis' as key topics. The proposed research directly addresses this by developing a conformal prediction framework specifically designed for black-box LLMs to provide uncertainty guarantees (calibrated sets) and enhance safety by reducing hallucinations, fitting squarely within the requested scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The core concept of using semantic distance in an embedding space as a nonconformity score for conformal prediction on LLM outputs is well-explained. The steps involving calibration data, embedding, quantile calculation, and test-time set generation are outlined. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise definition of the test-time score computation relative to the calibration distribution (though likely standard CP practice) and the exact inputs to the embedding model (candidate vs. prompt+candidate), but the overall proposal is understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory originality. While Conformal Prediction (CP) is established and its application to NLP/LLMs is an active research area, and using semantic similarity as a nonconformity score has been explored, this proposal combines these elements in a specific way for black-box LLMs generating *sets* of responses. It focuses on API-only access and semantic coherence within the predicted set. It represents a practical and relevant application/extension of existing techniques rather than a fundamentally new groundbreaking approach. The novelty lies in the specific formulation and application context."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly practical and implementable. It relies on standard components: black-box LLM APIs, pre-trained sentence embedding models (readily available), and standard CP procedures. Collecting a calibration dataset is a common requirement for CP and feasible. The computational steps (embedding, distance calculation, quantile search) are efficient. Potential challenges like the quality of embeddings or calibration data represent standard ML experimental factors rather than fundamental feasibility issues. Implementation seems straightforward with current technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical problem of uncertainty quantification and hallucination reduction in LLMs, particularly black-box models deployed in high-stakes domains (healthcare, legal). Providing rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees via CP is a major advantage over heuristic methods. Success would directly contribute to safer, more reliable, and trustworthy LLM deployments, aligning with the task's emphasis on mitigating operational risks and enhancing safety/auditing."
