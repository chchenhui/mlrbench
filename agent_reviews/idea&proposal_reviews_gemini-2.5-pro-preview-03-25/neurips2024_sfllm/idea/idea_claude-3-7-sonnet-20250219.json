        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task calls for new statistical tools for black-box LLMs, focusing on topics like bias, privacy, conformal prediction, and auditing. The proposed idea directly addresses these by suggesting a framework combining differential privacy (Privacy) and conformal prediction (Conformal prediction) to evaluate biases (Measuring bias) in black-box LLMs, specifically mentioning its use as an auditing tool (Auditing, safety, and risk analysis). It explicitly aims to provide statistical guarantees (new statistical tools) where standard methods may fail or compromise privacy."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation clearly articulates the problem (privacy-preserving, uncertainty-aware bias evaluation for black-box LLMs). The main idea concisely explains the proposed solution (combining DP and CP), the mechanism (prediction sets, DP noise, uncertainty intervals), and the target application (auditing third-party LLMs). The core concepts are readily understandable, and the proposed integration is clearly stated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While differential privacy, conformal prediction, and bias evaluation are individually established fields, their specific combination for privacy-preserving *bias evaluation* with *uncertainty quantification* in *black-box LLMs* offers a fresh perspective. Research exists on DP-CP and CP for fairness, but applying this specific combination to generate statistically robust and private bias metrics for auditing external LLMs represents a novel contribution beyond simply applying existing techniques independently."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Conformal prediction is well-suited for black-box models as it primarily requires model outputs. Differential privacy mechanisms are well-understood and implementable. Integrating DP noise into CP procedures is technically achievable, although careful calibration is needed to balance privacy guarantees with the utility/informativeness of the resulting bias metrics and uncertainty intervals. Access to labeled evaluation data with demographic attributes is required, which is standard for bias studies, and the DP component helps protect this data during analysis. The core technical components exist and can be combined."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Evaluating bias in LLMs, especially proprietary black-box models, is a critical challenge for responsible AI deployment. Ensuring privacy during this evaluation is paramount when dealing with sensitive data or model IP. Furthermore, moving beyond point estimates of bias to statistically calibrated uncertainty intervals (via CP) provides much-needed rigor for risk assessment and decision-making. This research directly addresses key ethical and practical concerns in AI safety and auditing, potentially leading to major advancements in trustworthy AI evaluation."
