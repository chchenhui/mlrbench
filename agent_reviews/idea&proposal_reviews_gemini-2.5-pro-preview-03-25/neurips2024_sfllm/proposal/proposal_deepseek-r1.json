        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description's focus on statistical tools for black-box models, specifically conformal prediction and safety/auditing for LLMs. It directly implements the research idea, detailing the semantic conformal prediction approach using embeddings and cosine distance. It also situates itself well within the provided literature review, addressing the identified challenges like black-box uncertainty quantification and the need for reliable scores beyond token probabilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology is broken down into logical, understandable steps with clear mathematical notation for key concepts like the nonconformity score and threshold calibration. The experimental design, including baselines, datasets, and metrics, is explicitly laid out. The structure is logical, making it easy to follow the proposed research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining semantic embeddings with conformal prediction theory to define nonconformity based on semantic distance (cosine similarity) for open-ended LLM generation. While conformal prediction for LLMs and the use of semantic embeddings are explored in the literature (as noted in the review, e.g., papers 7, 10), the specific formulation of using cosine distance to reference embeddings as the nonconformity score within a rigorous CP framework, especially the test-time calculation and the extension to CoT reasoning, offers a fresh perspective distinct from methods relying solely on token probabilities or self-consistency scores (like ConU)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on the sound theoretical foundation of conformal prediction. However, the specific definition of the nonconformity score at test time (Step 5: minimum distance to *all* calibration references) deviates from standard CP practices where the score typically relates the test point to its (unknown) true label. This choice requires strong theoretical justification or empirical validation to ensure the claimed finite-sample coverage guarantee (P(true response included) >= 1-alpha) actually holds under this definition. While plausible that semantic similarity correlates with correctness, this specific score formulation might compromise the formal guarantee. The rest of the methodology (calibration, embedding) is standard, but this potential theoretical gap lowers the soundness score. The CoT extension lacks sufficient detail for a full soundness assessment."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on accessible black-box LLM APIs and standard pre-trained sentence encoders. Data collection for calibration is standard practice. The computational steps (embedding, distance calculation, sorting, quantile finding) are generally efficient and implementable with current technology. Potential challenges include the need for a sufficiently large and representative calibration set and the dependency on the quality of the chosen sentence embedding model for capturing task-relevant semantics, but these are manageable risks common in ML research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of reliable uncertainty quantification for black-box LLMs, which is a major barrier to their deployment in safety-critical domains. Providing a method with statistical coverage guarantees, applicable to any LLM API, and potentially capable of auditing reasoning steps (CoT) would be a major advancement. Success would have substantial impact on LLM safety, trustworthiness, regulatory compliance, and the theoretical understanding of uncertainty in generative models."
