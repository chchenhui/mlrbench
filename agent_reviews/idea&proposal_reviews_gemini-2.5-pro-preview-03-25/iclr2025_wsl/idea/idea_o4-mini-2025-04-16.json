        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of treating neural network weights as a new data modality. It explicitly tackles key dimensions mentioned, such as leveraging weight space properties (symmetries like permutation and scaling), proposing a weight space learning task (model retrieval) using an equivariant architecture (GNNs) and a specific learning paradigm (contrastive learning). It aims to efficiently represent weights for a downstream task (model selection), directly answering one of the workshop's key questions. The motivation concerning large model zoos also mirrors the workshop's overview."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main technical approach (permutation-equivariant GNN encoder, contrastive learning with specific positive/negative sampling strategies), evaluation metrics, and expected impact are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. The concept of treating weights as graphs and using symmetry-preserving augmentations is explained well. Minor details regarding the specific GNN architecture or handling heterogeneous model architectures could be further specified, but the core research idea is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While using embeddings for retrieval or GNNs for graph data isn't new, applying permutation-equivariant GNNs specifically to raw network weights for the purpose of model zoo retrieval via contrastive learning is a novel combination. The explicit focus on leveraging weight symmetries (permutation, scaling) through equivariant architectures and data augmentation within a contrastive framework for this specific application offers a fresh perspective compared to metadata-based search or simpler weight distance metrics. It advances the concept of analyzing functional similarity directly from weights."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Accessing model weights, implementing GNNs and contrastive learning frameworks are standard practices. Libraries for equivariant networks exist. Key challenges include: 1) Scalability: Processing weights of potentially very large models and handling millions of models in a zoo. 2) Heterogeneity: Designing a GNN encoder that can robustly handle diverse network architectures (different layer types, connections, sizes) present in large repositories. 3) Data Curation: Defining and sourcing 'functionally distinct' models for negative pairs might require careful heuristics or additional metadata. While challenging, these seem like addressable research and engineering problems rather than fundamental impossibilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and growing problem of navigating massive model repositories efficiently. Discovering functionally similar models directly from weights, bypassing potentially sparse or misleading metadata, could drastically reduce redundant training efforts, save computational resources, and accelerate transfer learning and model reuse. Success would represent a major advancement in managing and leveraging the collective knowledge stored in model zoos, directly contributing to the workshop's goal of establishing weights as a valuable data modality and democratizing their use."
