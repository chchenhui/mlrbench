    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's goal of treating weights as a new data modality, focusing on symmetries, GNN-based learning paradigms, and model retrieval applications. The core idea of using permutation-equivariant contrastive embeddings is faithfully implemented. The proposal explicitly references and builds upon the concepts and challenges identified in the literature review (symmetries, GNNs for weights, contrastive learning, retrieval, scalability), positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape. All objectives and methods directly stem from the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to detailed methodology, experimental design, and expected impact. Key concepts like permutation/scaling symmetries, graph construction from weights, the equivariant GNN architecture, and the contrastive learning setup are explained precisely with mathematical formulations where appropriate. The objectives are distinct and measurable. While some technical details rely on cited works (e.g., steerable CNNs), the overall presentation is highly understandable and unambiguous for an expert audience."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While using GNNs for weight analysis and contrastive learning for embeddings are known concepts (as per the literature review), the specific combination and technical approach are innovative. The core novelty lies in designing a *permutation-equivariant* (not just invariant) GNN encoder, potentially extending Geom-GCN with steerable CNNs, specifically for functional model retrieval from raw weights. Furthermore, integrating this with a symmetry-aware contrastive learning framework and providing theoretical justification (equivariance proof sketch, distance preservation bounds) distinguishes it from prior work mentioned, which reportedly lacked rigorous equivariance or focused on different tasks (e.g., generation, architecture comparison)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates good rigor. It builds upon established foundations like GNNs (Geom-GCN), contrastive learning, and the mathematics of symmetry groups. The proposed methodology, including graph construction, the equivariant message passing scheme (referencing steerable CNNs), hierarchical pooling, and the contrastive loss function (including augmentations and negative sampling strategy), is well-reasoned. The inclusion of a theoretical justification sketch for equivariance in the appendix adds to the rigor. Minor points, like the precise implementation details of the geometric transformation \\\\Gamma(\\\\pi_{ij}) and the claimed O(1) complexity overhead, would need further elaboration, but the overall approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily related to scalability and dataset engineering. Processing potentially millions of parameters per network into graphs and running GNNs efficiently requires substantial computational resources and careful implementation. Curating and standardizing a large, heterogeneous dataset (vision, NLP, scientific models) with varying architectures is a major undertaking. While the plan outlines steps (quantization, meta-wrappers), the complexity should not be underestimated. The core GNN architecture and contrastive training are feasible in principle, but achieving the desired scale and performance requires considerable effort and resources, introducing moderate risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: efficiently navigating massive model zoos to facilitate model reuse and reduce redundant computation, a growing concern in ML. By leveraging functional similarity encoded in weights and respecting inherent symmetries, the work has the potential for major impact. Successful execution could lead to substantial savings in computational resources (~40% claimed), accelerate ML development, provide new tools for model analysis and architecture search, and advance the understanding of weight space geometry. The open-sourced system and benchmarks would be valuable community contributions."
