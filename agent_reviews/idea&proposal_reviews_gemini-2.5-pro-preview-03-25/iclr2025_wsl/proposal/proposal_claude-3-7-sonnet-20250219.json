    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of treating neural network weights as a data modality, focusing on key aspects highlighted in the task description like symmetries (permutation equivariance), learning paradigms (contrastive learning, GNNs), and applications (model retrieval). The methodology is a detailed expansion of the research idea, incorporating the GNN-based equivariant encoder and contrastive learning strategy. Furthermore, it explicitly acknowledges and builds upon the concepts and challenges identified in the literature review, such as the importance of symmetries, the use of GNNs and contrastive learning for weights, and the goal of model retrieval."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The introduction sets the context effectively, the objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step description of the proposed approach, including the encoder architecture (weight graph construction, layer-wise processing, cross-layer integration), the contrastive learning framework (positive/negative pair generation, loss function), data collection, and experimental design. Technical details like the GNN message passing formula and the InfoNCE loss are included. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the proposal readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the individual components (permutation equivariance, GNNs for graph data, contrastive learning) are known concepts, and related work exists applying them to weight spaces (as shown in the literature review), the specific synthesis into a unified framework for model retrieval is innovative. The detailed design of the permutation-equivariant encoder using layer-wise GNNs followed by a Transformer for cross-layer integration, combined with a carefully designed contrastive learning strategy including specific positive pair generation methods (permutation, scaling, pruning/retraining, distillation), represents a fresh approach. It builds significantly upon recent work but offers a distinct and well-specified methodology."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in the established properties of neural networks (permutation symmetry) and leverages appropriate, state-of-the-art techniques (equivariant GNNs, Transformers, contrastive learning). The rationale for using these methods is clearly explained and justified. The proposed methodology, including the graph representation of weights, the message-passing scheme, and the contrastive learning setup (InfoNCE loss, positive/negative pairs), is technically plausible and well-reasoned. The inclusion of an auxiliary loss based on performance metrics is a sensible addition. While details on handling diverse architectures (e.g., convolutions, attention) could be slightly more elaborated, the overall technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant engineering and computational challenges. Accessing and processing large model zoos is achievable but requires substantial effort. Training the proposed encoder architecture via contrastive learning on a large dataset of models will demand considerable computational resources (GPU time, memory). Generating some positive pairs (pruning/retraining, distillation) adds further computational overhead. The experimental evaluation, particularly the transfer learning experiments, is also resource-intensive. While the core technologies exist, scaling the approach effectively and handling the diversity of architectures in large repositories are non-trivial challenges that pose moderate risks to successful implementation within typical resource constraints."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the difficulty of navigating and reusing models from massive public repositories. Successfully developing functionally meaningful, symmetry-aware embeddings for model weights would have a substantial impact. It promises to improve model discovery efficiency, reduce redundant computation (promoting sustainable AI), accelerate transfer learning, and potentially enable new applications in AutoML, model analysis, and architecture search. By advancing the treatment of weights as a data modality, it aligns perfectly with the goals of the workshop task and could foster new research directions, making a strong contribution to the field."
