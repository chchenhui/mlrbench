    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses one of the workshop's central themes ('Foundation Models') and tackles multiple key challenges explicitly mentioned in the call for papers, including irregular sampling, missing values, multimodality, explainability, and practical applications (sepsis prediction). It proposes an innovative method relevant to healthcare time series, fitting the submission guidelines precisely."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation, the proposed model architecture (transformer with time-aware attention), the training strategy (self-supervised masked reconstruction), the approach to interpretability (attention gradients), the target data types (multimodal healthcare time series), and the expected outcomes. Minor details about the exact implementation of 'time-aware attention' could be further specified, but the overall concept is immediately understandable and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts (transformers, self-supervision, time-aware attention, gradient-based interpretability) into a cohesive foundation model specifically designed for the challenges of multimodal, irregularly sampled healthcare time series. While the individual components are not entirely new, their specific combination and application to create a robust and interpretable foundation model for this domain offers a fresh perspective and addresses a gap in current research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is largely feasible using current machine learning techniques and architectures. Transformers, self-supervised learning, and attention-based methods are well-established. The main challenges would be acquiring diverse, large-scale multimodal healthcare datasets (EHR, wearables, ECG) and the significant computational resources required for pre-training a foundation model. However, assuming access to data and compute, the technical implementation is practical and builds on existing methodologies."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant as it tackles critical barriers to the deployment of advanced AI models in healthcare: robustness to data imperfections (irregularity, missing values) and the need for interpretability. Developing foundation models that inherently handle these issues could lead to major advancements in clinical decision support, patient monitoring, and understanding disease progression from complex time series data, thus having substantial potential impact."
