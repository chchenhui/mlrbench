        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges highlighted in the task description (temporal dynamics, active nature, data scarcity in touch processing) and the workshop's goals (computational models, representation learning, datasets, lowering entry barrier). The methodology precisely implements the research idea (joint self-supervised contrastive learning and RL-based active exploration). Furthermore, it clearly positions itself within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging related work in active exploration (AcTExplore, Alice Johnson), contrastive learning (Contrastive Touch-to-Touch, MViTac), temporal modeling (Jane Doe, Michael Green), and dataset creation (Laura Red), while aiming to integrate these concepts in a novel way to tackle identified challenges."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a strong motivation and clearly stated objectives. The methodology section meticulously details the proposed framework, including the encoder architecture, contrastive loss formulations (standard and temporal), RL setup (state, action, reward, algorithm choice, curiosity), joint training procedure, dataset collection plan, and evaluation protocol. Technical details are presented concisely with supporting mathematical formulations where appropriate. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly articulated. There is very little ambiguity regarding the proposed work."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like self-supervised contrastive learning for tactile data and reinforcement learning for active exploration exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the core novelty lies in the proposed *joint framework* that synergistically combines these elements. The idea of having the representation learning module inform the active exploration policy, which in turn gathers data to improve the representations in a self-supervised loop specifically for temporal-spatial tactile data, is innovative. The specific temporal contrastive loss formulation and the integration of curiosity within the active exploration reward function tailored for tactile information gain further contribute to the novelty. It represents a significant step beyond applying standard vision techniques or addressing active exploration and representation learning in isolation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established machine learning techniques: contrastive learning (InfoNCE) for self-supervised representation learning and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with curiosity for reinforcement learning. The rationale for combining these techniques to address the specific challenges of active, temporal tactile sensing is well-argued. The proposed methodology, including the encoder architecture (CNN + Temporal module), loss functions, RL formulation (state, action, reward), and joint training strategy, is technically coherent. The evaluation plan is comprehensive. Minor weaknesses include the potential complexity of tuning the combined system and the reward function hyperparameters, but the overall approach is methodologically robust and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. The required hardware (6-DOF arm, high-res tactile sensor, motion capture) is standard for robotics research but requires access and expertise. The data collection effort (100+ objects, 1M+ frames) is substantial and time-consuming. The core technical challenge lies in implementing and stabilizing the joint training of the self-supervised representation learner and the RL-based exploration policy, which requires considerable expertise in both deep learning and RL. Tuning the reward function and ensuring the components work synergistically will require significant effort. While ambitious, it is achievable within a well-equipped research lab with the necessary expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses fundamental challenges in tactile processing, a field identified as crucial for robotics, prosthetics, and VR/AR. By proposing a framework that explicitly models the temporal and active nature of touch, it moves beyond adapting vision models and contributes to establishing touch processing as a distinct computational science, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals. Success would lead to more robust tactile understanding, enabling more dexterous robotic manipulation and improved human-computer interaction. Furthermore, the planned release of a large-scale dataset and open-source code would be a major contribution to the community, lowering the barrier to entry and fostering future research."
