    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for computational approaches to touch processing, representation learning, handling temporal/active aspects, and providing tools/datasets. The proposal accurately reflects the core research idea of jointly learning temporal representations via SSL and active exploration via RL. It effectively positions itself within the cited literature, identifying a clear gap (joint learning vs. separate approaches) and building upon existing work in SSL, RL, and tactile sensing. All sections consistently reinforce the central theme and objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and exceptionally well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is broken down into logical, detailed components (SSL model, contrastive loss, RL formulation, dataset, evaluation). Mathematical formulations are provided where necessary and are easy to understand. The structure is logical, flowing from background and motivation to methods, expected outcomes, and impact. Implementation details further enhance clarity. Minor ambiguities, such as the specifics of the k-NN entropy estimator or the exact interplay during joint training updates, are negligible compared to the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While utilizing established techniques like TCNs, contrastive learning (InfoNCE), and RL (PPO), the core novelty lies in their specific integration: jointly training a temporal self-supervised representation learner and an RL agent for active exploration, where the exploration policy is explicitly guided by maximizing information gain (entropy reduction) within the learned representation space. This tight coupling and specific objective function distinguish it from prior works that addressed SSL or active exploration separately, or used RL for exploration with different goals (e.g., coverage in AcTExplore). The novelty is clearly articulated and justified against the provided literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (TCNs, contrastive learning, MDPs, PPO) and established methods from relevant literature. The methodology is well-justified, with appropriate choices for the model architecture (TCN for temporal data), loss function (InfoNCE), and RL algorithm (PPO). The MDP formulation is clear, and the reward function based on information gain is theoretically motivated. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant tasks, strong baselines, and ablation studies. Potential minor weaknesses include the practical challenges of accurately estimating entropy in latent space and ensuring stable convergence of the joint training loop, but the overall approach is technically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. It requires significant resources (robot arm, high-end sensor, GPU compute) and substantial effort for data collection (50M frames). While the individual components (TCN, InfoNCE, PPO) are implementable using standard libraries, integrating and tuning the joint SSL-RL system presents a moderate technical challenge and risk. The data collection scale is large but achievable with automation. The plan is detailed, suggesting careful consideration of requirements. Overall, it's feasible within a well-resourced research setting, but the complexity and scale introduce manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses critical, timely challenges in tactile perception identified in the task description (temporal dynamics, active sensing, label scarcity). The potential contributions – a novel joint learning framework, improved tactile understanding, enhanced sample efficiency, and particularly the creation of a large-scale public dataset and open-source code – are substantial. Success would directly advance robotic manipulation, prosthetics, and haptics, while also lowering the entry barrier for research in computational touch processing, strongly aligning with the workshop's goals and promising considerable impact on the field."
