    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The task calls for 'Computational approaches to process touch data,' which is precisely what the idea proposes using TCNs for high-resolution tactile data. It directly addresses the challenges mentioned in the task description, such as handling the temporal components and unique structure of touch data from high-resolution sensors. The goal of developing a robust framework aligns with the workshop's aim to build foundations for touch processing and lower the entry barrier."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. It clearly states the motivation (challenges with high-res tactile data), the proposed method (TCNs with spatial convolutions and skip connections), expected outcomes (accuracy, efficiency), and potential impact. The core concept is easy to grasp. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architectural details (e.g., precise layering, fusion of temporal and spatial components), but this level of detail is often refined during research execution."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. TCNs are an established architecture for sequence modeling, and CNNs are standard for spatial data. Applying them to tactile data isn't entirely new, as related methods (like 1D CNNs, 2D CNNs on tactile frames, or RNNs) have been explored. The novelty lies primarily in the specific application of TCNs, potentially combined with spatial convolutions in a novel way, to address the challenges of *high-resolution* spatio-temporal tactile data. It's more of an adaptation and focused application of existing techniques rather than a fundamentally new concept."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible. TCNs are well-understood models with available implementations in standard deep learning frameworks. High-resolution tactile sensors and datasets are becoming increasingly accessible, as noted in the task description. The computational requirements for TCNs are generally manageable, potentially lower than some recurrent architectures for long sequences. Implementation involves standard machine learning practices like data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear potential impact. Effectively processing high-resolution tactile data is a key challenge in robotics, prosthetics, and human-computer interaction. If TCNs prove to be more effective or efficient than existing methods for this specific data type, it could lead to meaningful advancements in these application areas. Providing a robust computational tool contributes directly to the workshop's goal of establishing a computational science for touch processing."
