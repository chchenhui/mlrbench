    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key themes (representation properties, training objectives, modality interactions, robustness, geometry) and questions. It elaborates precisely on the research idea of using geometric alignment (OT, Riemannian) beyond instance-level contrastive loss. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, referencing recent relevant papers (GRAM, misalignment studies, geometric consistency) and explicitly tackling the identified challenges like misalignment, scalability, and balancing information. The 'Addressing Workshop Motivations' section further reinforces this strong alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear, well-structured, and logically organized. The background, problem statement, objectives, and experimental plan are well-defined. The use of equations for the losses aids understanding. However, the specific formulation and justification for the Riemannian loss term (\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Riemannian}}) lack full clarity. The calculation of the covariance matrix (\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^\\mathcal{V}_i = \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbf{X}_i^\\mathcal{V} \\mathbf{X}_i^\\mathcal{T} \\mathbf{X}_i^\\mathcal{V}) appears non-standard and requires better explanation regarding the definition of the local neighborhood matrices (\\mathbf{X}_i^\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbf{X}_i^\\mathcal{T}) and the rationale behind this specific product structure. Similarly, the loss function itself (\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^\\mathcal{V}_i \\log \\mathbf{\\Sigma}^\\mathcal{T}_i)) is not a common metric for comparing covariance matrices and needs clearer justification regarding what geometric property it enforces. These ambiguities slightly detract from the overall clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While components like contrastive learning, OT, and Riemannian geometry exist individually, their specific combination into a hybrid loss function (\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{contrastive}} + \\lambda_1 \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{OT}} + \\lambda_2 \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Riemannian}}) explicitly designed to align multimodal manifolds at both distributional (OT) and local structural (Riemannian) levels is novel. This approach distinguishes itself from purely instance-based methods (CLIP) and recent geometric methods like GRAM. Proposing a hybrid approach directly addresses the contemporary debate in the literature regarding the necessity and nature of alignment (e.g., Jiang et al., Tjandrasuwita et al.). The planned use of synthetic benchmarks for controlled evaluation also adds to the novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal is theoretically motivated by the limitations of existing methods and builds upon established techniques like contrastive learning and OT. The experimental design is generally rigorous. However, the soundness is significantly weakened by the questionable formulation of the Riemannian loss term (\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Riemannian}}). As noted under Clarity, the calculation proposed for the local covariance matrices (\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^\\mathcal{V}_i = \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbf{X}_i^\\mathcal{V} \\mathbf{X}_i^\\mathcal{T} \\mathbf{X}_i^\\mathcal{V}) is non-standard and its validity/interpretation is unclear. Furthermore, the loss function \\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^\\mathcal{V}_i \\log \\mathbf{\\Sigma}^\\mathcal{T}_i) lacks clear justification as a measure of Riemannian metric alignment compared to established metrics (e.g., Log-Euclidean distance). This core technical component requires significant clarification or correction to ensure mathematical rigor. While the rest of the proposal is largely sound, this weakness in a central part of the methodology lowers the score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard, publicly available datasets and common backbone architectures (Transformers, ResNet). The implementation of contrastive loss and OT loss (using Sinkhorn) is well-established. The computational requirements are high but typical for state-of-the-art multimodal research. The experimental plan, including baselines, metrics, and ablation studies, is practical. The main uncertainty regarding feasibility stems from the potential need to revise the Riemannian loss formulation if the current one proves unsound or ineffective, which might require additional theoretical work or experimentation. However, assuming a viable geometric loss can be implemented, the overall research plan is achievable with appropriate resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in multimodal representation learning: achieving robust and meaningful alignment beyond simple instance matching by considering the underlying geometry. Improving geometric consistency could lead to major advancements in cross-modal retrieval, generation quality, and robustness to noise or missing modalities, as hypothesized. The research directly tackles fundamental questions about representation properties and training objectives highlighted by the workshop and recent literature. Successful outcomes would provide valuable theoretical insights into the alignment vs. specificity trade-off and offer a potentially superior framework for multimodal fusion with broad applicability in areas like healthcare, robotics, and content creation."
