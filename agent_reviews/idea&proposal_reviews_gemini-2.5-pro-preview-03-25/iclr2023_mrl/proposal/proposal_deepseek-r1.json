        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding multimodal representation properties, particularly geometry, and how training objectives influence them. The proposed methods (OT, RMA for geometric alignment) stem directly from the research idea and are well-contextualized within the provided literature, citing relevant recent work (Cicchetti et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2023) and acknowledging challenges like misalignment. The objectives and evaluation plan directly tackle questions posed by the workshop and the core research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, three-stage methodology (Encoding, Alignment, Optimization), and experimental design are presented logically and are easy to understand. The mathematical formulations for OT and RMA are provided, giving a concrete idea of the approach. Expected outcomes are specific. Minor areas for refinement include the lack of the referenced Figure 1 (though the description is adequate) and potentially a slightly deeper explanation or justification for the specific RMA formulation chosen, linking it more explicitly to established manifold alignment techniques beyond conceptual similarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Optimal Transport and local structure preservation methods exist independently, the core novelty lies in their specific combination as explicit, complementary objectives (global OT + local RMA) for geometric alignment in multimodal representation learning. This approach contrasts with purely instance-based contrastive methods or methods focusing on only one aspect of geometry. It builds intelligently upon recent work cited in the literature review (e.g., Jiang et al.'s geometric consistency, Cicchetti et al.'s GRAM) but proposes a distinct framework focusing on the interplay between global distributional and local structural alignment."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. The motivation, grounded in the detrimental effects of geometric misalignment cited in the literature, is strong. Using Optimal Transport for distribution matching is theoretically well-founded. The concept of preserving local neighborhoods (RMA) is also sound. The experimental design is robust, featuring relevant datasets, strong baselines (including recent geometric methods), comprehensive evaluation metrics (task performance, geometric analysis, robustness), and a necessary ablation study. The RMA formulation, while clear, could benefit from slightly stronger theoretical justification or connection to established manifold alignment algorithms to reach 'Excellent'."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The proposed methods (OT via Sinkhorn, k-NN search for RMA, standard unimodal encoders, multi-task learning) are implementable using existing ML libraries and hardware (GPUs). The chosen datasets are standard benchmarks, although HowTo100M requires significant computational resources, which is a common challenge. The main risks involve the computational cost of OT at scale and the potential difficulty in tuning the weights for the multi-task objective function, but these are typical research challenges and appear manageable rather than fundamental roadblocks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and timely problem in multimodal learning â€“ understanding and improving geometric alignment for better representation fusion and robustness, directly aligning with the workshop's themes. Success would likely lead to improved cross-modal task performance, enhanced model robustness (especially to missing modalities), and valuable theoretical insights into the role of geometry in multimodal learning. The potential development of standardized geometric evaluation metrics would also be a valuable contribution to the community. The potential impact spans both theoretical understanding and practical applications."
