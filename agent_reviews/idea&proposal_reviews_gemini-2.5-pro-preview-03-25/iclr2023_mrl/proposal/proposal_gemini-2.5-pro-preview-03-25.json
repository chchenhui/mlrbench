        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the MRL workshop's focus on representation properties (specifically geometry), the influence of training objectives, and robustness. It systematically elaborates on the core research idea of using explicit geometric alignment (OT, Riemannian) to go beyond instance-level contrastive methods. Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging standard methods (CLIP), recent geometric approaches (GRAM), and the ongoing debate about the necessity of strict alignment (Jiang et al., Tjandrasuwita et al., Cai et al.), clearly motivating the need for explicit geometric control."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with background and motivation, clearly stating objectives, detailing the methodology (conceptual framework, specific loss functions like OT/Sinkhorn and Riemannian variants, data, algorithms), and outlining a comprehensive experimental plan. Key concepts are explained well, and the mathematical notation for OT is presented correctly. While the exact formulation for the neighborhood preservation loss could be slightly more concrete, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality. While the idea of considering geometry in multimodal learning is emerging (as evidenced by the literature review, e.g., Cicchetti et al., Jiang et al.), the specific approach of incorporating explicit Optimal Transport and Riemannian geometry-based losses (neighborhood preservation, distance matrix alignment) alongside standard contrastive objectives offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond implicit alignment or alternative geometric measures like Gramian volume, proposing distinct mechanisms for structural alignment. The novelty lies in the specific formulation and application of these geometric tools for this purpose."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations in multimodal learning, contrastive methods, Optimal Transport, and Riemannian geometry. The proposed methodology, including the combined loss function and the specific geometric alignment losses (OT via Sinkhorn, neighborhood/distance preservation), is technically plausible. The experimental design is comprehensive and rigorous, featuring relevant baselines, standard benchmarks, appropriate task metrics, dedicated geometric analysis metrics (W-dist, MMD, Procrustes, etc.), ablation studies, and robustness checks. Minor improvements could involve providing more explicit mathematical forms for all proposed losses (e.g., L_{Neigh})."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It plans to use standard benchmark datasets and readily available pre-trained encoders. Implementing the core contrastive framework is standard. The proposed geometric losses, while adding complexity, are based on established techniques; OT solvers (Sinkhorn) are available in libraries, and neighborhood/distance calculations are computationally standard, albeit potentially intensive. The main challenges involve managing computational cost (especially with large batches or high dimensions) and hyperparameter tuning (\\lambda_{GA}), which are common and generally manageable risks in deep learning research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. It addresses a critical and timely problem in multimodal representation learning: understanding and controlling the geometric structure of shared embedding spaces beyond simple instance alignment. This directly tackles core questions highlighted by the MRL workshop. Success in developing methods for explicit geometric alignment could lead to more robust, semantically richer representations, potentially improving performance on fine-grained cross-modal tasks and enhancing robustness. The research promises valuable theoretical insights into the role of geometry and practical methodological advancements for the field."
