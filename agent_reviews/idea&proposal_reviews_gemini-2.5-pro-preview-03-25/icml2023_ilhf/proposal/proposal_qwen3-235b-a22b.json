    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the task description, such as learning from implicit multimodal feedback (speech, facial expressions, EEG, eye-tracking), handling unknown/contextual feedback grounding via intrinsic reward learning, adapting to non-stationarity using meta-learning, and aiming for social alignment. The methodology closely follows the research idea, proposing multimodal transformers, contrastive/IRL-based reward learning, and meta-adaptation. It also explicitly references relevant work (PEBBLE) and tackles key challenges identified in the literature review (implicit feedback interpretation, non-stationarity, multimodal integration)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, with defined objectives, methodology, and evaluation plans. The overall goal and approach are understandable. However, certain aspects could be refined. Objective 3 ('Bridge Representation Gaps') is somewhat vague compared to the others. The exact mechanism of the contrastive reward learning (Step 1) needs more detail: specifically, how implicit signals (like EEG or frustration scores) are used to guide the contrastive process or select pairs, especially given the claim of learning 'without explicit supervision' while also mentioning 'implicit feedback labels'. Clarifying how the contrastive loss truly captures nuanced implicit intent beyond just comparing trajectory returns would strengthen the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing concepts like multimodal learning, RLHF, meta-learning, and contrastive learning, the specific combination and application are innovative. The core novelty lies in proposing a contrastive learning framework to infer *intrinsic* rewards directly from *unstructured, multimodal, implicit* human feedback (going beyond explicit preferences or simple error signals like ErrP), coupled with meta-learning for rapid adaptation in non-stationary interactive settings. This approach offers a fresh perspective compared to standard RLHF or methods like PEBBLE, focusing specifically on leveraging the richness of implicit social cues without predefined semantics."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, based on established methods like multimodal transformers, contrastive learning principles, meta-learning (MAML-like), and PPO. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics. However, the soundness of the core reward learning mechanism requires clearer justification. The link between the proposed contrastive loss on trajectory returns and the successful interpretation of subtle, contextual implicit cues (e.g., frustration via facial expression) needs stronger theoretical grounding or empirical evidence cited. The ambiguity noted in the Clarity section regarding how implicit signals inform the contrastive loss slightly impacts the perceived rigor of this central component."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal faces significant feasibility challenges, primarily concerning data collection. Gathering 50,000 high-quality interactions from 200 participants involving multiple complex modalities (video, audio, EEG, eye-tracking) and associated annotations is extremely ambitious and resource-intensive (time, cost, infrastructure, expertise). While the ML components (transformers, contrastive learning, meta-RL) are technically implementable with existing tools, the data requirements present a major bottleneck and risk. A smaller-scale pilot study might be a more realistic starting point. The complexity of reliably extracting meaningful signals from noisy implicit data (especially EEG/eye-tracking) also adds to the challenge."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in interactive AI: learning effectively from the rich, implicit feedback humans naturally provide. Success would represent a major advancement over systems relying solely on explicit rewards or preferences. It has substantial potential impact across critical domains like assistive robotics, personalized education, and accessibility, enabling more intuitive, adaptive, and socially aligned AI systems. By reducing the burden of explicit labeling, it could foster broader deployment. The planned release of a large-scale multimodal interaction dataset (if feasible) would also be a significant contribution to the community."
