        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the task, such as learning from implicit multimodal feedback (gaze, expressions, etc.), handling non-stationarity, inferring rewards without predefined semantics (via IRL), and aiming for socially aligned agents. The methodology directly implements the research idea (transformer, IRL, meta-RL for multimodal feedback). It also acknowledges and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as interpreting implicit feedback, non-stationarity, and multimodal integration. The objectives and impact align well with the goals outlined in the task description for advancing interactive learning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The objectives, overall methodology (data, model, IRL, meta-RL, experiments), and expected impact are clearly articulated. The use of sections and subsections aids readability. However, some technical details lack precision. Specifically, the connection between the output of the multimodal transformer (joint latent space/intent predictor) and the input required for the Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) reward estimation (R(s,a)) is abstract and not clearly defined. The exact mechanism of how feedback translates into a reward signal via IRL needs further elaboration beyond the high-level formula provided. The role of the 'Intent Predictor' relative to the IRL process could also be clearer."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like transformers for multimodal data, IRL, and meta-RL are known, their specific combination to learn *intrinsic* reward functions *directly* from *implicit, multimodal* human feedback (beyond explicit preferences or single modalities like EEG) appears innovative. The focus on inferring rewards without predefined semantics for the feedback signals and using meta-learning to adapt this learned reward function adds to the novelty. It distinguishes itself from the cited literature, which often relies on explicit feedback (Lit 1, 2), single implicit modalities (Lit 3), or imitation learning (Lit 4), by proposing a more integrated RL-based approach for interpreting raw, implicit, multimodal cues as rewards."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is conceptually sound, grounding itself in established methodologies like multimodal learning, IRL, and meta-RL. The choice of these techniques is appropriate for the stated objectives. However, the proposal lacks technical depth and rigor in key areas. The IRL formulation (R(s, a) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\text{human feedback}}[r]) is overly abstract and doesn't specify how the expectation is computed or how the feedback (represented in the latent space) translates to a reward 'r'. Standard IRL challenges (e.g., reward ambiguity, data requirements) are not discussed. Similarly, the meta-learning aspect lacks detail on how the reward function adaptation specifically occurs. The technical formulations are presented but are too high-level to fully assess their correctness and suitability without further specification."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Collecting high-quality, annotated multimodal interaction data is resource-intensive and complex. Training the proposed multimodal transformer and integrating it with potentially unstable IRL and meta-RL algorithms requires substantial computational resources and expertise. Debugging and tuning this complex system will likely be difficult. While simulated environments might ease data collection initially, ensuring the learned behaviors transfer effectively to real-world interactions with subtle human feedback is a major hurdle. Success depends heavily on access to resources and specialized expertise, and there are considerable risks related to data quality, algorithm stability, and evaluation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in interactive AI: enabling agents to learn from the rich, implicit feedback humans naturally provide. Moving beyond hand-crafted or explicit scalar rewards is crucial for developing truly adaptive, intuitive, and socially aware AI systems. Success would have a substantial impact on fields like assistive robotics, personalized education, and general human-computer interaction, potentially leading to more natural, collaborative, and effective AI assistants. The research directly tackles key limitations of current methods and aligns with the goal of creating AI that is better integrated into human social contexts, including potential benefits for accessibility."
