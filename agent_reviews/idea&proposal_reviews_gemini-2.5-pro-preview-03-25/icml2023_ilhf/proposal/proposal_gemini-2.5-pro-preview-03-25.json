    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenges outlined in the task description, such as learning from implicit, multimodal feedback with unknown grounding, handling non-stationarity via meta-learning, and designing intrinsic rewards for social alignment. The methodology closely follows the research idea, elaborating on the transformer encoder, IRL-inspired reward learning, and meta-RL integration. It effectively positions itself relative to the cited literature, building upon concepts from RLHF, PEBBLE, and multimodal agent research while explicitly aiming to overcome their limitations (e.g., reliance on explicit feedback, single modalities, or lack of reward learning from implicit cues)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected impact are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow. The four specific research objectives are unambiguous. The algorithmic steps (Encoder, Reward Inference, Meta-RL) are explained in sufficient detail for a proposal, including architectural choices and learning paradigms. The rationale connecting the methodology to the objectives and significance is strong. Minor ambiguities might exist in the exact implementation details of the contrastive preference learning or meta-RL updates, but this level of detail is appropriate for a proposal stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. The core novelty lies in the specific combination of learning an intrinsic reward function *directly* from *multimodal* implicit human feedback *without pre-defined semantics*, and using *meta-RL* to enable rapid adaptation of both the policy and the reward interpretation model. While components like multimodal transformers, IRL/preference learning, and meta-RL exist, their synthesis to address the problem of learning reward grounding from implicit, ambiguous, multimodal signals in an adaptive way is novel. It significantly extends existing RLHF approaches (often relying on explicit feedback) and implicit feedback studies (often single-modality or predefined signals like ErrP). The distinction from prior work (e.g., MIA's focus on imitation/self-supervision) is clear."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on solid theoretical foundations in RL, multimodal learning, preference learning, and meta-learning. The proposed methodology (transformer encoder, contrastive preference learning for reward, MAML-based adaptation) uses established techniques applied to a new problem context. The technical formulations provided are conceptually correct. However, the core challenge of reliably inferring a meaningful reward signal (preference/intent) from inherently noisy, ambiguous, and potentially user-specific implicit multimodal signals is significant. The proposed bootstrapping and contrastive learning approaches are plausible but require strong empirical validation to demonstrate they can overcome this ambiguity effectively. The assumption that implicit signals consistently correlate with underlying reward needs careful examination in the chosen task environments. Minor gaps exist in specifying the exact loss functions and optimization details, but this is acceptable at the proposal stage."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Integrating real-time multimodal data capture (vision, audio, potentially gaze), processing with complex models (transformers), learning a reward function from subtle cues, and implementing meta-RL requires substantial engineering effort, computational resources, and expertise. Data collection, especially synchronized multimodal data from human subjects, is complex and requires careful setup and ethical considerations (IRB). The core reward inference step is technically risky â€“ it might be difficult to learn a robust reward signal from implicit feedback alone. While the plan to start with simulation is prudent, transitioning to real human interaction adds considerable complexity. The project is ambitious and requires significant resources and time, placing it at the 'Satisfactory' to 'Good' boundary, leaning towards Satisfactory due to the inherent difficulty of the core learning problem."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in creating truly adaptive and intuitive interactive AI systems: learning from natural, implicit human communication. Success would represent a major advancement over current RLHF methods relying on explicit feedback, pushing towards more seamless human-AI collaboration. It directly tackles fundamental questions about interaction-grounded learning and social alignment highlighted in the task description. The potential applications in personalized education, assistive robotics, healthcare, and collaborative AI are substantial and transformative. By reducing the need for hand-crafted rewards or burdensome explicit feedback, it could significantly enhance the scalability and applicability of interactive learning systems in real-world social contexts."
