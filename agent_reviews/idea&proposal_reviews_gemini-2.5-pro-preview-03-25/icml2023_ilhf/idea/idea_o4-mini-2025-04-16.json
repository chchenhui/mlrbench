        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Interactive Learning with Implicit Human Feedback' by proposing a method to learn from multimodal cues (gaze, facial expressions, gestures, prosody) without explicit rewards. It tackles key questions from the task description, such as learning from initially unknown/ambiguous signals, handling non-stationarity in user preferences, and moving beyond hand-crafted rewards in RL. The focus on multimodal, implicit feedback, self-supervision, and adaptation fits squarely within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main components (multimodal data collection, self-supervised contrastive embedding, Bayesian reward modeling, RL integration, active queries), and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The proposed framework is immediately understandable, with only minor ambiguities perhaps around the specific architectures or scale of implementation, which is expected at the idea stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like contrastive learning, Bayesian reward models, RL, and active learning exist, their specific synthesis for *online, self-supervised learning of latent rewards from multiple implicit multimodal cues* (gaze, face, speech, gesture) combined with Bayesian adaptation for non-stationarity and active queries for disambiguation is innovative. It moves beyond typical approaches that might use single modalities, simpler mappings, or require more explicit supervision/pre-defined reward structures."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Collecting synchronized multimodal data is achievable. However, implementing online self-supervised cross-modal contrastive learning requires substantial data and computational resources, potentially hindering real-time performance. Fitting and updating a Bayesian reward model online adds computational complexity. Integrating these components robustly within an RL loop is a considerable engineering task. While feasible in a research setting, practical deployment might require simplifications or significant computational power."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental challenge in human-AI interaction: leveraging natural, implicit human signals instead of relying solely on explicit feedback. Success would enable more intuitive, personalized, and adaptive interactive systems across various domains (robotics, education, assistive tech). Reducing the need for hand-crafted rewards and adapting to non-stationary preferences could lead to major advancements in building scalable and user-friendly AI."
