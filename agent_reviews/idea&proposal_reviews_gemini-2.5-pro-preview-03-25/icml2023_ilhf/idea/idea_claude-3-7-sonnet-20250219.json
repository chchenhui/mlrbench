    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Interactive Learning with Implicit Human Feedback', focusing specifically on facial expressions, which is explicitly mentioned as a key implicit signal in the task. The idea tackles central questions posed in the task, such as learning from initially unknown, high-dimensional feedback signals (unsupervised clustering and adaptive interpretation of expressions) and moving beyond explicit rewards in RL. It aligns perfectly with the goal of exploring how algorithms can leverage natural human cues in interactive settings."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with a well-defined motivation and a structured three-stage approach. The overall goal of learning personalized feedback models from facial expressions is understandable. The stages (unsupervised representation, correlation for reward inference, adaptive interpretation) provide a logical flow. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific algorithms or mechanisms within the correlation and adaptation stages (e.g., how exactly correlation translates to reward, how adaptation avoids instability), but the core concept and research direction are well-articulated and comprehensible."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While using facial expressions in HCI or affective computing is established, the core novelty lies in integrating them into an RL framework *without pre-defined semantic labels* and learning their meaning *interactively* through correlation and adaptation. This contrasts with common approaches that use pre-trained emotion classifiers mapped to fixed rewards. The combination of unsupervised clustering, interaction-grounded reward inference, and adaptive interpretation specifically for facial feedback in RL presents a fresh and innovative approach to implicit feedback."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Stage 1 (unsupervised clustering of facial expressions) is achievable using existing computer vision and ML techniques. However, Stage 2 (inferring rewards via correlation) and Stage 3 (adaptive interpretation) are technically challenging. Reliably associating unlabeled, potentially subtle or ambiguous facial patterns with underlying reward purely through interaction data is difficult and may require large amounts of data, careful assumption design, or sophisticated correlation techniques. Ensuring the adaptation process is stable and converges effectively adds complexity. Real-time processing requirements further compound these challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance and impact potential. It addresses a critical limitation in current interactive RL systems â€“ the over-reliance on explicit, often cumbersome, user feedback. Enabling agents to learn from natural, implicit signals like facial expressions could drastically improve the intuitiveness, efficiency, and user experience of human-machine interaction. Success in this area could lead to major advancements in personalized AI, robotics, virtual assistants, and accessibility tools, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the task description."
