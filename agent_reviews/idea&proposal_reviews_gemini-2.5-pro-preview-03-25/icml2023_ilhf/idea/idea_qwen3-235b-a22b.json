        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of learning from implicit, multimodal human feedback (language, gaze, gestures) instead of explicit rewards, which is central to the workshop's focus. It tackles key questions posed in the task, such as learning from initially unknown/ambiguous signals without explicit rewards, reducing reliance on hand-crafted rewards in RL, and enabling interaction-grounded learning. The proposed self-supervised grounding and contrastive reward learning mechanism specifically targets the challenge of interpreting rich, high-dimensional, and potentially ambiguous feedback signals mentioned in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is compelling, and the main technical approach is broken down into logical steps: modeling signals as time-series, using mutual information for alignment, employing contrastive learning for reward inference, and integrating with RL. The concepts of self-supervision, cross-modal consistency, and contrastive learning are understandable within the ML context. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architectures or the precise formulation of the contrastive loss, but the overall research direction and methodology are clearly presented."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While learning from preferences or demonstrations exists, the proposed method of using cross-modal self-supervision (mutual information maximization across modalities and time) specifically to *ground* initially unknown implicit signals for *reward inference* via contrastive learning in an RL context is innovative. It combines existing techniques (self-supervision, contrastive learning, RL) in a novel way to address the specific challenge of interpreting ambiguous, multimodal feedback without predefined mappings or explicit labels, pushing beyond standard preference-based RL."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The core components—time-series modeling, mutual information estimation, contrastive learning frameworks, and standard RL algorithms—are well-established in machine learning. Implementation would require careful design, particularly for the cross-modal alignment and contrastive reward function components. Data generation, even in simulation using proxy signals as proposed, is achievable. Real-world application would introduce further challenges (sensor noise, real-time constraints), but the proposed approach is sound for research and development, especially within simulated environments initially."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental limitation in RL (reward specification) and a key challenge in HCI (natural interaction). Successfully learning grounded rewards from implicit, multimodal feedback could lead to major advancements in adaptive robotics, personalized AI assistants, and other systems requiring intuitive human-AI collaboration. It directly tackles several core research questions highlighted in the task description, indicating its relevance and potential to make meaningful contributions to the fields of interactive ML, RL, and HCI."
