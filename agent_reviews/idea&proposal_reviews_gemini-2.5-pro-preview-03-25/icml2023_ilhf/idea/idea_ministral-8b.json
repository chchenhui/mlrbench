    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Interactive Learning with Implicit Human Feedback' by proposing an adaptive RL framework that leverages multimodal cues (natural language, speech, eye movements, facial expressions, gestures) mentioned explicitly in the task. It tackles key challenges highlighted, such as learning from implicit signals instead of just explicit rewards, grounding feedback, and adapting to non-stationarity. The idea aligns well with the workshop's goal of exploring how to leverage rich, high-dimensional, potentially ambiguous feedback signals in interactive settings."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-defined, the main idea is broken down into logical, understandable steps (Data Collection, Feature Extraction, Feedback Grounding, Adaptive Learning, Evaluation), and the expected outcomes and potential impact are clearly stated. The core concept of using multimodal implicit feedback within an adaptive RL framework is communicated effectively, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the overall research direction and methodology."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While learning from implicit feedback or using RL in interactive settings exists, the proposed integration of *multiple* implicit modalities (vision, language, speech, etc.) simultaneously for *grounding* feedback within an *adaptive* RL framework specifically designed to handle non-stationarity offers a fresh perspective. It moves beyond single-modality feedback or simple preference learning, aiming for a more holistic interpretation of human intent during interaction. The emphasis on grounding initially unknown or ambiguous signals adds to its innovative aspect."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Collecting comprehensive, synchronized multimodal interaction data is resource-intensive. State-of-the-art methods exist for feature extraction, but integrating them robustly is complex. The 'Feedback Grounding' step is particularly challenging, requiring sophisticated methods to interpret noisy, ambiguous, and context-dependent implicit signals and translate them into actionable information for the RL agent. Developing adaptive RL algorithms that effectively use this grounded feedback and handle non-stationarity adds another layer of complexity. While conceptually sound, successful implementation requires substantial effort and expertise across multiple domains (CV, NLP, Speech, RL, HCI)."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds excellent significance and potential impact. It addresses a critical limitation in current human-AI interaction paradigms â€“ the reliance on explicit, often cumbersome, feedback mechanisms. Success could lead to significantly more natural, intuitive, and efficient interactive systems. The potential for improved personalization and adaptability has broad implications across domains like assistive technology (explicitly mentioned in the idea and relevant to the task's HCI/accessibility points), education, robotics, and collaborative tools. It directly tackles fundamental questions about human-AI communication and learning."
