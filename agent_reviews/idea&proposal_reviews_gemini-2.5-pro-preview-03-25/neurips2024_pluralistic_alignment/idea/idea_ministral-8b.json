    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'pluralistic AI alignment' by proposing a method to integrate diverse values using 'crowdsourced consensus-building techniques', explicitly aligning with the workshop's aim to explore methods drawing from 'governance and consensus-building practices'. The idea covers key topics mentioned in the call, including 'methods for pluralistic ML training' (consensus algorithms), 'datasets suitable for pluralistic AI' (crowdsourced value collection), and 'designing human-AI interaction that reflects diverse user experiences and values'. It fits well within the intersection of ML, HCI, and social sciences highlighted by the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with distinct motivation, a main concept broken down into four logical steps, and stated outcomes/impact. The overall goal and approach are well-articulated and understandable. Minor ambiguities exist in the specifics of the 'consensus algorithms' (e.g., how exactly conflicts are resolved beyond multi-objective optimization) and the precise nature of the 'human-AI interaction workflows'. While sufficient for a research idea summary, further elaboration on these technical components would enhance precision."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by synthesizing existing concepts (crowdsourcing, ML for optimization, HCI) into a specific framework for pluralistic AI alignment focused on consensus-building. While individual elements aren't entirely new, the integration and application to explicitly model and reconcile diverse, conflicting human values via crowdsourced consensus algorithms represent a fresh approach compared to alignment methods focusing on single preference functions or simpler aggregation. The emphasis on consensus inspired by social/governance models adds an innovative layer to technical AI alignment research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant practical challenges. Large-scale, representative crowdsourcing (Step 1) is resource-intensive and methodologically complex to execute without bias. Developing robust ML 'consensus algorithms' (Step 2) capable of handling deep value conflicts and scaling effectively is a substantial research challenge. Designing and evaluating effective 'human-AI interaction workflows' (Step 3) for complex value discussions is non-trivial. Defining suitable 'evaluation metrics' (Step 4) for pluralistic alignment is also an open problem. While plausible as a research direction, implementation requires considerable resources, interdisciplinary expertise, and overcoming significant technical hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a problem of high significance. Aligning AI with diverse and often conflicting human values is a critical challenge for developing ethical, fair, and trustworthy AI systems. Current alignment methods often fall short in capturing this pluralism. Successfully developing a scalable framework for pluralistic alignment, as proposed, could lead to major advancements in AI safety, ethics, and governance, potentially having a substantial positive impact on how AI is integrated into society."
