        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of the 'Pluralistic Alignment Workshop' by proposing a concrete framework (FCVA) for integrating diverse values, handling conflicts (via social choice and multi-objective optimization), and incorporating techniques relevant to multiple workshop topics, including 'Methods for pluralistic ML training' (federated value modeling), 'Methods for achieving consensus' (social-choice aggregation), 'Navigating privacy challenges' (differential privacy), and 'Democratic processes' (interactive stakeholder dashboard). It tackles the insufficiency of current methods in capturing pluralistic values, as mentioned in the workshop motivation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with distinct sections for motivation, the main idea (broken into four stages), expected outcomes, and potential impact. The four-stage process provides a logical flow. Key concepts like federated learning, differential privacy, Borda count, multi-objective RL, and Pareto fronts are mentioned, giving a good sense of the technical approach. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the exact mechanism for privacy-preserving perturbations on the Borda count or the specifics of the value predictor training data, but the overall concept and workflow are well-articulated and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The novelty lies primarily in the specific integration and synthesis of existing techniques (federated learning, social choice theory, multi-objective RL, differential privacy, interactive visualization) into a cohesive framework explicitly designed for pluralistic AI value alignment. While individual components are not entirely new, their combination to address value diversity, minority preference preservation, privacy, and stakeholder interaction within a single pipeline offers a notable and innovative approach compared to standard alignment methods focusing on single objective functions or centralized data."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible as it builds upon established techniques. Federated learning, differential privacy, social choice mechanisms, multi-objective RL, and interactive dashboards are all areas with existing research and tools. However, integrating these components seamlessly presents moderate challenges. Ensuring robust privacy guarantees across the pipeline, managing the computational complexity of multi-objective RL with potentially many value functions, and designing an effective, scalable interactive dashboard require careful engineering and potentially significant resources. Data acquisition (annotated value data from diverse cohorts) also presents practical hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant and increasingly critical problem in AI ethics and alignment: how to align AI systems with diverse, complex, and often conflicting human values present in pluralistic societies. Moving beyond monolithic alignment objectives towards methods that respect diversity and empower stakeholders is crucial for responsible AI development. If successful, FCVA could provide a valuable framework for democratizing AI alignment, enhancing fairness (especially for minority groups), and increasing the trustworthiness and social acceptance of AI systems, leading to major advancements in the field."
