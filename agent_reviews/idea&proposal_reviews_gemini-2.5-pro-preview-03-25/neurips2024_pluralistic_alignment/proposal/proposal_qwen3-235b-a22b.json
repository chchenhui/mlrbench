        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the Pluralistic Alignment Workshop's call for methods integrating diverse values, using multi-objective techniques, and drawing inspiration from consensus-building. It faithfully expands on the MOVR research idea, detailing the vector-valued representations and context-sensitive arbitration. Furthermore, it explicitly incorporates and builds upon concepts from the provided literature review (MORL, vector-valued RL, preference elicitation, context-sensitive arbitration, transparency, etc.) and tackles the key challenges identified therein. All core components resonate strongly with the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, the methodology follows a logical structure (data collection, algorithm, validation), and the significance is well-argued. Technical concepts like POMDPs and vector Q-learning are introduced, and the arbitration mechanism is described conceptually. However, the precise implementation details of the arbitration strategies (Consensus-seeking, Trade-off Surfacing, Adaptive Weighting) and the operationalization of 'stakes' (sigma) could benefit from further elaboration for complete clarity. The connection between the learned value prototypes and the reward vector components is implied but could be more explicit. Overall, it is well-written and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing work in MORL, vector-valued RL, and multi-objective optimization (as cited in the literature review), the core novelty lies in the proposed context-sensitive arbitration mechanism that dynamically selects resolution strategies (consensus, trade-off surfacing, adaptive weighting) based on context (c) and stakes (sigma). This specific mechanism for navigating value conflicts in pluralistic alignment appears innovative. The integration of diverse preference elicitation, vector representations, and this dynamic arbitration into the cohesive MOVR framework represents a fresh approach compared to simpler aggregation or static weighting methods. It clearly distinguishes itself from prior work mentioned."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks (POMDPs, MORL, multi-objective optimization) and methodologies (stratified sampling, scenario-based elicitation, Siamese networks for representation learning). The proposed vector-valued Q-learning approach and scalarization techniques are standard in MORL. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive, including a relevant case study, baselines, and multiple evaluation metrics covering accuracy, representation, alignment, user satisfaction, and conflict resolution. Technical formulations appear correct. Acknowledging limitations (bias, complexity, manipulation) and proposing mitigations strengthens the proposal's rigor. Minor concerns exist regarding the practical definition and measurement of 'stakes' (sigma)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. Recruiting 5,000+ diverse global participants requires significant resources and logistical planning. Implementing vector-valued RL and the integrated MOVR system is computationally intensive (acknowledged O(V) overhead) but achievable with modern tools (PyTorch) and expertise. The experimental validation involving MTurk studies and expert validation is standard but requires careful execution. The main challenges lie in the scale of data collection and the complexity of integrating and tuning the various components (elicitation, learning, arbitration). The proposal acknowledges key risks and suggests mitigation strategies, indicating good planning, but successful execution depends heavily on securing adequate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely challenge in AI alignment: representing and navigating diverse, often conflicting, human values without resorting to oversimplification. This directly aligns with the core goals of the Pluralistic Alignment Workshop. If successful, MOVR could lead to fairer, more transparent, and more trustworthy AI systems, particularly in high-stakes domains like content moderation. The potential contributions—computational value pluralism, dynamic conflict resolution, enhanced transparency, and a valuable benchmark dataset—would represent substantial advancements in the field. The societal impact on AI governance, equity, and safety is clearly articulated and potentially transformative."
