        "justification": "The research idea 'SpatiaSonic' aligns perfectly with the task description for the 'Audio Imagination' workshop. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed, including 'Video to Audio Generation', 'Generation of spatial audio and experiences driven by spatial audio', 'Generation of audio for virtual or augmented reality (VR/AR)', and implicitly 'Synchronized Generation of audio along with visuals' by linking audio events to visual input. It also mentions evaluation, another topic listed. The focus on generating spatial audio from 360° video for immersive applications is highly relevant to the workshop's scope."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with a well-defined motivation and a structured three-stage pipeline (Scene Understanding, Acoustic Simulation, Conditional Diffusion Synthesis). The inputs (360° video) and outputs (multi-channel spatial audio) are specified, and the core mechanism (diffusion model conditioned on semantics and RIRs) is explained. While the overall concept is clear, some specific details (e.g., exact vision model architecture, RIR computation specifics, diffusion model conditioning details) could be further elaborated, but the current level of detail is good for a research idea summary."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like video-to-sound, diffusion models for audio, and acoustic simulation exist individually, the proposed integration is innovative. Specifically, using deep scene understanding from 360° video (depth, trajectory, semantics) to inform both coarse acoustic simulation (RIRs) and semantic conditioning for a diffusion model generating *spatial* (multi-channel) audio appears novel. It moves beyond standard video-to-sound by incorporating explicit spatial acoustic modeling within a modern generative framework."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Training sophisticated multi-task vision models for 360° video and large conditional diffusion models requires significant computational resources and expertise. Acoustic simulation, even coarse, adds complexity. The most significant potential bottleneck is the availability of large-scale, high-quality training data: paired 360° videos with corresponding multi-channel spatial audio recordings accurately synchronized and labeled. Data acquisition or simulation might require considerable effort. However, the individual technical components are based on existing and advancing research areas, making the project challenging but achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance. Automating the generation of realistic spatial audio for VR/AR, gaming, and telepresence addresses a critical bottleneck in immersive content creation, which is currently labor-intensive and costly. Success would enhance user immersion and presence, potentially accelerating the adoption of these technologies. It also contributes meaningfully to multimodal AI research by tightly integrating vision, acoustic physics, and audio generation. The potential impact on both the research community and the media industry is substantial."
