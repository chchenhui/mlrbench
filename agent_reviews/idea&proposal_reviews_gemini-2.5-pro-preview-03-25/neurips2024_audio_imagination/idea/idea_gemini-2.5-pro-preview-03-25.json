    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description (NeurIPS 2024 Audio Imagination Workshop). It directly addresses several key topics listed in the call for papers, including 'Video to Audio/Speech/Music Generation', 'Multimodal generation of audio - going beyond unimodal inputs (text/video/audio) to audio â€” using multiple modalities for generating audio', and 'Synchronized Generation of audio along with visuals'. The focus on generating audio conditioned on both video and text fits perfectly within the workshop's theme of advancing generative AI for audio, particularly exploring its relationship with other modalities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (need for multimodal context), the main components (video/text encoders, cross-modal attention fusion, audio decoder), and the expected outcome (context-aware, synchronized audio) are clearly explained. Examples of potential model types (diffusion, transformer) are provided. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the specific architecture of the cross-modal attention module, but the overall concept and approach are readily understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. While video-to-audio and text-to-audio generation are established areas, conditioning audio generation simultaneously on *both* video and detailed text prompts using a specific fusion mechanism is a more recent and less explored direction. Cross-modal attention itself is a well-known technique, so the novelty lies primarily in its specific application and architectural design for fusing video and text representations effectively for audio generation. Several recent works explore multimodal audio generation, so this idea builds upon existing trends rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking concept, but the specific focus on video+text fusion via cross-attention offers potential for novel contributions."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Key components like pre-trained video encoders, language models, audio decoders (diffusion/transformers), and attention mechanisms are readily available. Suitable datasets combining video, audio, and potentially text (like annotated subsets of large video datasets) exist or could be curated, although this might require effort. The main challenge lies in the significant computational resources required for training large multimodal models and the engineering effort needed to effectively implement and tune the cross-modal fusion mechanism. However, there are no fundamental technological barriers making it impractical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Generating audio that is contextually consistent with both visual scenes and textual descriptions addresses a key limitation in current generative models. Success would lead to more controllable, realistic, and immersive audio generation for applications like automatic video dubbing/sound design, virtual/augmented reality, accessibility tools, and creative content generation. It pushes the boundaries of multimodal understanding and generation, contributing meaningfully to the field."
