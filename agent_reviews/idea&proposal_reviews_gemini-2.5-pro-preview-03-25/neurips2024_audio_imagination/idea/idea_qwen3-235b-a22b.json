    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses AI-driven speech generation (specifically Text-to-Speech) and falls squarely within several listed workshop topics, including 'Text-to-speech', 'Methods for Evaluation of Generated Audio' (by providing authenticity verification), 'Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music' (a core motivation), and 'Novel applications of audio/speech/music generation'. The focus on verifiable synthesis using generative models aligns perfectly with the workshop's theme of advancements in generative AI for audio and its responsible deployment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation (audio deepfake risks), the core technical proposal (steganographic watermarking in TTS latent space using diffusion models), the key components (embedding tied to metadata, differentiable extraction, robust encoders), and the expected outcomes (quantitative metrics for accuracy and distortion on specific datasets) are all clearly articulated. The impact is also well-defined. While implementation details could be further elaborated in a full paper, the core concept and research plan are exceptionally clear and unambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While audio watermarking itself is not new, the proposed method of integrating steganography directly into the latent space of modern generative TTS models (specifically diffusion models) during the synthesis process is innovative. Combining this with content-specific identifiers (prompts, authors, timestamps), differentiable extraction networks, and watermark-robust encoders represents a fresh approach compared to traditional post-processing watermarking or simpler embedding techniques. It tackles the verification problem from within the generation pipeline."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents notable technical challenges. Diffusion models for TTS are state-of-the-art and implementable. Steganography in latent spaces and differentiable extractors are conceptually sound. However, achieving the ambitious target metrics (~98% detection accuracy with <1dB distortion) simultaneously, while ensuring robustness against common audio manipulations (compression, noise, etc.), is challenging. Embedding sufficient information without compromising audio quality or being easily removable requires careful design and experimentation. Access to standard datasets (VCTK/FS2) and significant computational resources for training diffusion models are required but standard for this type of research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea holds high significance and impact potential. Addressing the proliferation of audio deepfakes and establishing provenance for synthetic media is a critical challenge with broad societal implications for trust in media, security, and personal identity. Developing a robust, integrated framework for verifiable synthesis in TTS could lead to major advancements in responsible AI deployment, providing essential tools for accountability and misuse mitigation. Success would impact journalism, legal systems, content creation platforms, and the generative AI field itself."
