        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly relevant to the workshop task. It directly addresses the topic 'Methods for Evaluation of Generated Audio'. Furthermore, it incorporates 'Multimodal generation of audio' (by evaluating audio in context with text/video), 'Generation of audio for virtual or augmented reality (VR/AR)', and touches upon 'Responsibility in generative AI' by aiming for better evaluation beyond simple metrics. The focus on perceptual quality and context aligns perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on the challenges of audio perception and its relationship with other modalities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-defined (limitations of current metrics), and the main components of the proposed CAM-Eval framework (contrastive embeddings, human metrics, task objectives) are explicitly listed. The expected outcomes are also stated. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise architecture of the evaluator models or the exact integration mechanism of the three components, but the core concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While individual components like using embeddings (e.g., CLAP score, FAD) or human evaluation for audio assessment exist, the novelty lies in the proposed synthesis: a unified framework explicitly combining cross-modal embeddings, structured human perceptual feedback, and task-specific objectives (especially for VR/AR). Training evaluator models on this rich, multimodal, context-aware data represents a novel approach compared to relying solely on individual, often context-agnostic, metrics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Leveraging existing contrastive embeddings is possible, but fine-tuning or training new ones requires large datasets. Collecting reliable human perceptual data via crowdsourcing is resource-intensive (time, cost, experimental design). Defining and measuring task-specific objectives like 'VR immersion' robustly can be complex. The primary bottleneck is likely the creation of a large, diverse, and well-annotated dataset incorporating generated audio, multimodal context, human scores, and task metrics, which is needed to train the proposed evaluator models effectively."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Evaluation is a major bottleneck hindering progress in generative audio. Existing metrics often fail to capture perceptual quality, creativity, or suitability for specific contexts like VR/AR or multimodal scenarios. Developing a more nuanced, context-aware, and perceptually grounded evaluation framework like CAM-Eval could lead to major advancements by enabling more meaningful model comparisons, guiding research towards perceptually better results, and fostering the development of audio generation models tailored for real-world applications, particularly in creative and immersive domains."
