    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for responsibility in generative audio AI (a key workshop topic) by focusing on verifiable TTS synthesis. The methodology, objectives, and significance detailed in the proposal are a direct and comprehensive implementation of the research idea. Furthermore, it explicitly builds upon and positions itself within the context of the provided literature, referencing relevant concepts like diffusion-based TTS watermarking, robust detection, and the challenges identified (e.g., imperceptibility vs. robustness)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The background, objectives, high-level methodology (components, data, metrics), and expected impact are presented logically. However, some technical details could be more precise. For instance, the exact mechanism for integrating the watermark into the diffusion model's latent space beyond simple concatenation is not fully specified. Similarly, the training procedures for the differentiable extraction network and the watermark-robust encoder for zero-shot detection could benefit from further elaboration to remove minor ambiguities."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a satisfactory level of novelty. It combines several recent advancements: diffusion models for TTS, steganographic watermarking, differentiable extractors, and robust encoders for zero-shot detection. While the literature review indicates prior work exists in diffusion-based watermarking (Chen et al., 2024) and robust/zero-shot detection (Brown et al., 2023; AudioSeal), the specific proposed architecture integrating these elements for verifiable TTS synthesis offers a novel combination and application focus. It's more of a strong integration of existing concepts tailored to a specific problem rather than a fundamentally groundbreaking technique. The novelty could be articulated more strongly against the cited works."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established techniques like diffusion models, learnable watermarking, and standard TTS datasets/metrics. The proposed architecture is plausible, and the evaluation plan is relevant. However, the ambitious performance targets (~98% accuracy, <1dB distortion) require strong justification and careful execution, as the imperceptibility-robustness trade-off is challenging. The proposal lacks deep technical formulations (understandable for a proposal but limits full assessment) and specifics on how the latent space embedding avoids degrading synthesis quality or how true zero-shot robustness will be achieved and validated."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current ML technology and standard datasets. The components (diffusion models, encoders, decoders) are well-understood, although training them effectively requires significant computational resources. The main challenge lies in simultaneously achieving the high targets for imperceptibility, robustness (especially against diverse/unknown attacks), detection accuracy, and zero-shot capability. This presents a significant research risk, making the project ambitious but plausible within a research context. The experimental plan is logical but achieving the stated outcomes is not guaranteed."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem: the lack of trust and verifiability in AI-generated audio (deepfakes). Developing a robust framework for watermarking TTS models to ensure provenance and enable detection would have substantial impact across journalism, legal systems, personal security, and the promotion of responsible AI practices. It directly tackles ethical concerns surrounding generative audio, aligning perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on responsibility."
