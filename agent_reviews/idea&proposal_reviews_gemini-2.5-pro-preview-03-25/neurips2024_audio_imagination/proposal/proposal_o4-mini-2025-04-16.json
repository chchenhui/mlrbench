    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description (NeurIPS Audio Imagination Workshop topics like TTS, evaluation, responsibility), the research idea (expanding on the core concept of integrated watermarking in diffusion TTS), and the literature review (acknowledging prior work like XAttnMark, AudioSeal, diffusion watermarking, and addressing identified challenges like integration and standardization). It directly targets relevant workshop themes and builds logically upon the provided context and prior art."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. Objectives are specific and measurable (e.g., <1 dB SNR loss, >= 98% accuracy). The methodology is detailed, including data, architecture specifics (diffusion backbone, conditioning mechanism), loss functions with mathematical formulations, extractor design, training pseudo-code, and a comprehensive experimental plan. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While building on existing diffusion TTS models and watermarking concepts, the core novelty lies in the proposed end-to-end framework ('StegaDiff') that *jointly* trains the TTS generator, a specific watermark conditioning mechanism within the UNet (\\phi_w(w) concatenated with text context), and a differentiable watermark extractor. This deep integration, combined with the goal of zero-shot detection and establishing benchmarks, distinguishes it from prior work which might focus on post-hoc methods or less integrated approaches (as suggested by the literature review, even considering Chen et al., 2024). The specific architectural modification for conditioning is a clear novel contribution."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It leverages state-of-the-art diffusion models for TTS and established principles for audio watermarking (psychoacoustic loss for imperceptibility, robustness via augmentation). The methodology is well-justified, including the choice of loss functions (\\mathcal{L}_{\\rm diff}, \\mathcal{L}_{\\rm wm}, \\mathcal{L}_{\\rm imp}) and the joint training approach. Technical formulations are provided and appear correct. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering baselines, robustness, generalization, ablations, and crucial human evaluation, indicating methodological rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly practical and implementable. It relies on public datasets (VCTK, FS2) and standard deep learning techniques (diffusion models, CNNs, attention) and hardware (GPUs). The proposed steps, including data preprocessing, model training (with specified hyperparameters and duration), and evaluation, are well-defined and realistic for a typical research project. While balancing the loss terms and achieving high zero-shot robustness are challenging research goals, the plan itself is feasible with current technology and resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and timely issue: the lack of traceability and verifiability in high-fidelity synthetic speech (audio deepfakes). Developing a robust, integrated watermarking framework like StegaDiff has high potential impact for responsible AI deployment, media authentication, legal evidence verification, and combating misinformation. The goal of establishing benchmarks and open-sourcing the code further enhances its potential significance by fostering reproducible research in this important area."
