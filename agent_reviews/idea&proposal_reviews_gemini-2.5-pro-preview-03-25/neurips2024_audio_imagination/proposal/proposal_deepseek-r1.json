        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music' topic listed in the NeurIPS workshop call. The methodology and objectives perfectly match the provided research idea, elaborating on the integration of steganography into diffusion-based TTS for verifiable synthesis. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and builds upon the cited literature, referencing specific techniques (psychoacoustic masking, generator-detector architectures, diffusion TTS) and baselines (XAttnMark, AudioSeal, FakeSound), while explicitly aiming to tackle key challenges identified in the review (imperceptibility vs. robustness, integration, detection accuracy, zero-shot detection, standardization)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the research design, data, and specific techniques (watermark embedding in diffusion models, differentiable extraction, zero-shot detection via robust encoders) with relevant mathematical formulations (diffusion step modification, psychoacoustic loss, detection loss, contrastive loss). The experimental design, including baselines and metrics, is clearly outlined. The expected outcomes are specific and measurable. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving minimal room for ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like diffusion models for TTS, audio watermarking, psychoacoustic masking, and robust encoders exist (as evidenced by the literature review), the novelty lies in their specific integration and application. Key novel aspects include: 1) Embedding the watermark directly within the diffusion model's denoising steps conditioned on the watermark code. 2) The joint training framework optimizing diffusion, imperceptibility (psychoacoustic loss), and watermark detection simultaneously. 3) The proposed use of contrastive learning specifically to train a watermark-robust encoder for zero-shot detection of watermarked synthetic speech. This combination represents a fresh approach compared to applying existing watermarking techniques post-hoc or using simpler integration methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in diffusion models, steganography, psychoacoustic principles, and deep learning. The proposed methodology is well-justified, employing established techniques like cross-attention for conditioning, psychoacoustic masking for imperceptibility, convolutional networks for detection, and contrastive learning for robust representation. The technical formulations presented for the core components (diffusion update, loss functions) are appropriate and correctly formulated. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics for thorough evaluation. While joint optimization might pose challenges, the overall approach is technically robust and well-grounded in the relevant literature."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. It relies on standard deep learning techniques, publicly available datasets (VCTK, FS2), and established evaluation metrics. The required computational resources (GPUs for training diffusion models) are significant but standard for this type of research. The plan is realistic and broken down into logical steps. Potential challenges include the complexity of the joint optimization process and achieving the ambitious performance targets for imperceptibility, robustness, and zero-shot detection simultaneously. However, these are research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks, making the project highly feasible for a well-equipped research team."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and urgent societal problem of audio deepfakes and the lack of provenance in AI-generated content. By proposing a method for embedding verifiable watermarks directly into the TTS synthesis process, it offers a proactive solution for mitigating misuse, enhancing trust in media, and supporting regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act). Success would represent a major advancement in responsible AI for audio generation, setting standards for accountability and potentially influencing practices across the field. The potential impact on journalism, legal systems, and content creation platforms is substantial."
