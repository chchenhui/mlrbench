    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core idea of steganographic watermarking in TTS using diffusion models. It fits perfectly within the NeurIPS workshop's scope, particularly topics like TTS, evaluation methods, and responsibility in generative AI. The methodology explicitly builds upon and aims to advance the state-of-the-art presented in the literature review (e.g., mentioning AudioSeal, XAttnMark, diffusion-based TTS watermarking) and addresses the key challenges identified (imperceptibility vs. robustness, integration, detection, standardization)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Outcomes, Limitations). Research objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology is broken down into understandable components with clear technical descriptions, including mathematical formulations and architectural concepts (diffusion process, watermark encoding, extraction loss, contrastive loss). The experimental design and evaluation metrics are specific and well-articulated. While highly technical, the proposal is presented with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While audio watermarking and diffusion-based TTS exist separately (as shown in the literature review), the core idea of integrating steganographic watermarking directly into the *latent space* of diffusion models, conditioned on both text and a secret code using learned orthogonal directions, is innovative. Combining this with differentiable extraction and specifically training robust encoders for *zero-shot* detection using contrastive learning offers a fresh perspective compared to existing methods like AudioSeal or XAttnMark. It's not entirely groundbreaking but represents a significant and novel synthesis of techniques applied to this problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages well-established foundations (diffusion models, steganography, psychoacoustics, deep learning). The mathematical formulations for the diffusion process, watermark embedding, and loss functions are appropriate. The methodology, including joint training of generator/extractor and the use of psychoacoustic masking, is well-justified. The experimental plan is comprehensive, including relevant metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. Minor areas needing further empirical validation include the practical effectiveness of learned orthogonal vectors and the robustness of the zero-shot detection approach, but the overall technical approach is solid."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. It requires substantial computational resources (8 A100 GPUs) and expertise in advanced generative models. Implementing and jointly optimizing the diffusion model, watermark embedding, extraction network, and potentially the zero-shot encoder is complex. Achieving the ambitious targets for robustness (98% accuracy under diverse attacks) and zero-shot performance (>90%) will require significant research effort and tuning. However, the plan is detailed, uses standard datasets, and relies on existing frameworks (PyTorch, NeMo), making it achievable within a well-resourced research environment, albeit with moderate risk regarding hitting all performance targets."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of audio deepfakes and the lack of verifiable provenance for synthetic speech, which has profound societal implications for media trust, security, and individual rights. A successful outcome would provide a valuable technical solution for responsible AI deployment in audio generation, potentially influencing industry standards (like C2PA for images) and aiding forensic analysis. The development of standardized benchmarks is also a significant contribution to the field."
