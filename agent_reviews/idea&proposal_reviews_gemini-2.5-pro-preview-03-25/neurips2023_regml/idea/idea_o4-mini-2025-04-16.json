        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's task description. It directly addresses the core theme of bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory policies by proposing a concrete framework ('Policy2Constraint') to translate regulatory text into algorithmic implementations (ML constraints). This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on operationalizing regulations and developing novel algorithmic frameworks for compliance (e.g., fairness, data usage like GDPR mentioned in the idea)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation is well-defined, outlining the problem of manual translation. The proposed three-stage framework (Regulatory NLP -> Formalization -> Constrained Optimization) provides a clear, logical structure for the research. The specific examples (GDPR, fair housing) and expected outcomes (toolkit, benchmarks) further enhance understanding. There are no significant ambiguities in the core concept."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like legal NLP, formal methods, and constrained optimization exist, the proposed end-to-end integration to automatically translate raw regulatory text into differentiable constraints for ML training is innovative. The specific challenge of mapping extracted norms into differentiable penalty functions suitable for standard optimization pipelines represents a fresh approach compared to manually defining constraints or relying solely on post-hoc audits."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible as a research project, but presents significant technical challenges. Stage 1 (Regulatory NLP) requires sophisticated models capable of handling the complexity and ambiguity of legal language. Stage 2 (Formalization), particularly translating potentially complex logical predicates into *differentiable* functions, is non-trivial and may not be possible for all types of regulatory norms. Stage 3 (Constrained Optimization) is more standard. While ambitious, the approach is plausible within a research context using current ML and NLP techniques, though achieving high accuracy and broad applicability will require substantial effort and potentially new methodological developments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It tackles a critical bottleneck in deploying trustworthy AI systems: ensuring compliance with complex and evolving regulations. Automating this process could drastically reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and enable scalable development of regulation-aware ML. Success would provide valuable tools and insights for both researchers and practitioners, potentially leading to major advancements in responsible AI and facilitating regulatory adherence in high-stakes domains like finance and healthcare."
