        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea 'AuditGen' aligns excellently with the workshop task description. The workshop explicitly calls for 'Evaluation and auditing frameworks for ensuring that ML models comply with regulatory guidelines' and highlights 'New regulation challenges posed by large generative models and methods to mitigate them, especially in the area of creative industries'. AuditGen directly addresses these points by proposing a framework to audit generative models for copyright compliance, a key regulatory concern for creative industries impacted by large models. It fits perfectly within the scope and aims of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation (copyright risks), the main components (input probing, similarity analysis, risk quantification), and the overall goal (providing tools for assessment) are well-defined. The proposed three-step process provides a logical structure. While the specific technical details of the probing strategies, multi-modal analysis, and risk metrics are not fully elaborated, the core concept and approach are communicated effectively and are largely unambiguous for a research proposal summary."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While techniques for detecting data memorization or similarity analysis (hashing, embeddings) exist individually, AuditGen proposes a novel integration into a systematic, automated framework specifically tailored for *copyright compliance auditing* in generative models. The focus on creating standardized reports and risk quantification metrics for regulatory purposes, rather than just technical memorization detection, adds a layer of originality. It combines existing concepts in a new configuration to address a specific, pressing regulatory challenge."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. The technical components like prompt generation, similarity analysis using known techniques (hashing, embeddings, string matching), and metric development are generally achievable. However, the major hurdle lies in creating or accessing a 'representative database of known copyrighted works' at scale, which involves substantial legal, logistical, and potentially prohibitive cost issues. Defining 'substantial similarity' in a legally robust way and creating universally accepted risk metrics are also non-trivial challenges. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation, especially regarding the database, requires considerable effort and may face obstacles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Copyright infringement risks associated with generative models are a major concern for developers, businesses, and policymakers worldwide, directly impacting the creative industries. Developing systematic auditing tools like AuditGen addresses a critical, unmet need for responsible AI deployment and regulatory compliance. Success in this area could lead to major advancements in trustworthy AI, provide practical tools for industry, and inform future regulations, making the potential impact substantial."
