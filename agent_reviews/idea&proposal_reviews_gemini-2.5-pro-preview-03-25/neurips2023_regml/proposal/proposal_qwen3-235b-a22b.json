    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (Workshop on Regulatable ML), the research idea (Policy2Constraint), and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of bridging the gap between ML and regulatory policies by proposing a concrete framework to operationalize regulations. The methodology clearly elaborates on the 3-stage idea, and it explicitly positions itself relative to the cited literature (e.g., LegiLM, Compliance-as-Code, ACT), aiming to tackle the key challenges identified in the review, such as legal text interpretation, formalization, and constraint integration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Evaluation, Outcomes, Conclusion). The objectives are explicitly stated and broken down into manageable stages. Each stage of the methodology is detailed with specific techniques (e.g., Legal BERT, GNN, FOL, MLNs, Lagrangian Relaxation) and includes a helpful technical workflow example. Evaluation plans (datasets, metrics, baselines) and expected outcomes (toolkit, benchmarks) are concrete and understandable. There is minimal ambiguity, making the proposal easy to follow and comprehend."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by aiming to create an automated *end-to-end* pipeline from raw legal text to constrained ML training. While individual components build on existing work (Legal NLP, constrained optimization, formal methods), the specific integration and application are novel. It goes beyond existing works like LegiLM (assessment, not training constraint generation) or ACT (assumes constraints are given). The combination of domain-specific NLP for norm extraction, translation to FOL/MLNs, conversion to *differentiable* penalties, and integration into multi-objective optimization frameworks with temporal considerations presents a fresh and comprehensive approach to the problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, built upon established methods in NLP (BERT, GNNs), formal logic (FOL, MLNs), and optimization (Lagrangian Relaxation, Adversarial Training). The theoretical basis for using differentiable surrogates for constraints is reasonable. However, the soundness hinges critically on the performance of challenging components: 1) High-accuracy NLP extraction from inherently ambiguous legal text is difficult. 2) Faithfully translating nuanced legal norms into formal logic (FOL/MLNs) without loss or misinterpretation is non-trivial. 3) Approximating hard constraints with soft penalties might not guarantee strict compliance. While the proposed methods are appropriate, these inherent difficulties introduce potential weaknesses that require careful handling and validation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Success requires overcoming hurdles in: 1) Curating large, accurately annotated legal datasets (requiring legal expertise). 2) Achieving high performance in the NLP norm extraction phase. 3) Developing robust methods for formalization and handling constraint conflicts. 4) Managing the computational complexity of multi-objective constrained optimization. Integrating custom differentiable constraints into existing ML frameworks (like XGBoost) can also be technically demanding. While the components exist, their seamless integration into a robust end-to-end system is ambitious and requires substantial resources (compute, expertise in ML, NLP, logic, law)."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of AI, law, and ethics â€“ the operationalization of regulations in ML systems. Automating this process could drastically reduce compliance costs and risks for industries deploying AI in regulated sectors (finance, healthcare). The expected outcomes (open-source toolkit, benchmarks) would be valuable resources for both researchers and practitioners. Success would represent a major advancement in 'Regulatable ML', fostering trust and accountability in AI systems, directly aligning with the goals outlined in the task description."
