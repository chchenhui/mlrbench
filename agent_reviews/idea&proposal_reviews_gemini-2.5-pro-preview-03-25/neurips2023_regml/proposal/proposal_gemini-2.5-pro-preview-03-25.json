    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the task description: bridging the gap between regulatory policies and ML implementation. The proposed 'Policy2Constraint' framework directly operationalizes the research idea's three-stage approach (NLP -> Formalization -> Constrained Optimization). Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited literature, referencing specific works for legal NLP (Zhu et al., Ershov, Hassani et al.), formalization/constraints (Wang et al.), compliance in specific domains (Rida), and related concepts like machine unlearning (Marino et al.). The objectives and methodology directly tackle topics mentioned in the workshop call, such as operationalizing rights (fairness, data usage), providing evaluation frameworks (via case studies and metrics), and developing novel algorithmic frameworks for compliance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, starting with a strong background and problem statement, followed by a clear articulation of the proposed solution (Policy2Constraint), specific research objectives (O1-O5), a detailed methodology broken down into three stages plus validation, and expected outcomes/impact. Each stage of the methodology is explained with sufficient detail regarding techniques (e.g., NER, relation extraction, FOL mapping, penalty function examples, optimization algorithms) and expected outputs. The language is precise and technical concepts are explained well. While some implementation details remain open (as expected in a proposal), the overall research plan, goals, and approach are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components leverage existing research areas (legal NLP, formal methods, constrained ML optimization), the core novelty lies in their integration into a single, automated end-to-end framework ('Policy2Constraint') specifically designed to translate natural language regulatory text directly into trainable ML constraints. Existing work often focuses on parts of the problem (e.g., legal text analysis, manual constraint implementation, post-hoc verification). The automated generation of differentiable penalty functions directly from NLP-extracted requirements derived from legal text represents a significant step beyond prior art like Shaikh et al. (2017) which focused more on alerting/logging, or Wang et al. (2024) which focused on aligning LM outputs rather than training general ML models based on external legal text constraints. The proposal clearly distinguishes its integrated approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in NLP, formal methods, and machine learning optimization. The methodology is well-structured and technically detailed. Stage 1 leverages state-of-the-art NLP techniques. Stage 2 acknowledges the core challenge of translating logic to differentiable penalties and proposes plausible approaches (using existing metrics, gradient-based penalties, relaxation techniques) referencing relevant work (Wang et al.). Stage 3 correctly identifies appropriate standard and advanced optimization techniques (weighted sum, multi-objective methods). The experimental design is rigorous, including specific case studies, relevant datasets, appropriate baselines, comprehensive evaluation metrics (covering both task performance and constraint satisfaction), and plans for ablation studies. Technical formulations, like the example DP penalty, are correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges, primarily in Stage 2 (Formalization & Constraint Generation). Translating complex, potentially ambiguous legal requirements extracted via NLP into accurate, effective, and differentiable (or approximately differentiable) penalty functions is inherently difficult and represents the main risk factor. Success depends heavily on developing robust methods for this translation. Stage 1 (NLP) also requires high-quality (potentially annotated) legal text data and robust models to handle legal language nuances. Stage 3 (Optimization) is more standard but multi-objective optimization can be complex to tune. The project requires significant expertise across multiple fields (NLP, ML, Formal Methods, potentially Law) and computational resources. While ambitious, the plan is broken down logically, and the proposed methods are grounded in existing research, making it plausible, albeit challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of AI, law, and ethics â€“ the operationalization of regulatory requirements in ML systems. The gap between high-level legal principles and concrete ML implementation is a major bottleneck for developing trustworthy AI. If successful, the 'Policy2Constraint' framework could provide a scalable, systematic, and verifiable way to build 'compliance-by-design' ML systems, reducing risks and costs for organizations. The potential impact spans academia (advancing regulatable ML research), industry (enabling compliant AI deployment), regulators (potential for automated auditing tools), and society (fostering trust in AI). The open-source toolkit would further amplify its impact. The research aligns perfectly with the goals of the Workshop on Regulatable ML."
