    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the workshop ('FMs in the Wild') by focusing on reliability and hallucination mitigation, a key challenge mentioned. The proposed Multi-Level Contrastive Learning (MLCL) framework directly implements the research idea, elaborating on the token, statement, and source-reliability levels. Furthermore, the proposal effectively situates itself within the provided literature, acknowledging existing work on hallucination detection (ReDeEP, REFIND, Bi'an), mitigation (Iter-AHMCL, RAG-HAT), and contrastive learning (Jiang et al., Zheng et al.), while clearly articulating its distinct focus on intrinsic prevention through a multi-level approach. It comprehensively integrates the background, problem, idea, and prior work into a coherent plan."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to the proposed solution, objectives, detailed methodology, and expected impact. The core concept of MLCL and its three levels are explained precisely. Research objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (implicitly). The methodology section provides substantial detail on the conceptual framework, data requirements, algorithmic formulation (including loss functions), training procedures, and a comprehensive experimental plan. The language is precise and academic, minimizing ambiguity. It is immediately understandable to someone familiar with the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using contrastive learning for hallucination mitigation isn't entirely new (as evidenced by Jiang et al., 2023 and Wu et al., 2024 in the literature review), the proposed **multi-level** approach combining token, statement, and particularly **source-reliability** contrastive learning within a single framework is innovative. The source-reliability component, aiming to embed sensitivity to information provenance directly into the model's representations via contrastive learning to combat hallucination, appears to be a distinct contribution compared to existing methods that often focus on post-hoc source checking in RAG or single-level contrastive approaches. The proposal clearly articulates this multi-level combination as its core novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and methodologically rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations of contrastive learning (InfoNCE) and applies them logically to the problem of hallucination. The proposed multi-level framework is well-reasoned, addressing hallucination at different granularities. The methodology outlines a robust experimental plan, including appropriate base models, strong baselines (covering standard fine-tuning, RAG, related CL methods, and detection/correction approaches), relevant evaluation metrics and datasets (both general and domain-specific), and necessary ablation studies. The technical formulation of the loss functions is generally correct, although the specific implementation details for integrating source reliability information into representations for the source-level contrastive loss require further elaboration. The acknowledgment of data curation challenges and the plan for verification add to the soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Fine-tuning existing large FMs is standard practice, avoiding the infeasibility of pre-training. The core ML techniques are established. However, the primary challenge lies in the **curation of high-quality, large-scale contrastive datasets** for all three levels, especially generating plausible-but-false hallucinations and reliably labeling source credibility. This requires substantial effort, potentially including significant human annotation or sophisticated automated verification pipelines. Tuning the hyperparameters for the combined loss function (\\lambdas, \\tau) will also be complex. While the plan is generally realistic and uses existing technologies, the data generation aspect poses a moderate risk to timely execution and requires careful planning and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem in contemporary AI: the reliability of foundation models due to hallucination. This issue is a major barrier to trustworthy AI deployment, particularly in high-stakes domains like medicine, finance, and law, aligning perfectly with the workshop's focus. Successfully developing a method that intrinsically reduces hallucination tendency during training/fine-tuning would be a major advancement over purely post-hoc methods. The potential impact includes enhanced FM trustworthiness, safer AI deployment, enablement of new applications, contribution to responsible AI practices, and deeper scientific understanding of hallucination mechanisms. The research has clear potential for substantial contributions to the field."
