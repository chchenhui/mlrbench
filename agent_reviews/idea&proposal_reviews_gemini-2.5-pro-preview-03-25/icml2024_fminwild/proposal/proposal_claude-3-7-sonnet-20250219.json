    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of the workshop ('FMs in the wild') by focusing on reliability (specifically hallucination reduction), a key challenge mentioned. It faithfully expands on the research idea, detailing the multi-level contrastive learning approach. Furthermore, it situates the work within the provided literature, acknowledging related contrastive learning and RAG approaches while clearly positioning its preventative, multi-level framework as a distinct contribution addressing identified key challenges like hallucination mitigation and knowledge integration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, multi-level methodology, and rationale are articulated effectively. The structure is logical and easy to follow. The mathematical formulations provide a good overview, although some definitions (e.g., anchor/reference embeddings) could be slightly more explicit. The RAG integration section (2.3) is conceptually clear but could benefit from more detail on the 'Compatibility' function and the precise mechanism of incorporating the verification score. Overall, the proposal is well-articulated and understandable with only minor areas for refinement."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using contrastive learning and RAG for hallucination reduction are concepts present in the literature review (e.g., papers 1, 4, 7, 8, 9), the specific combination of a *multi-level* contrastive approach (token, statement, source-reliability) applied during fine-tuning appears novel. This structured approach targeting different granularities of factual inconsistency distinguishes it from existing single-level or model-level contrastive methods cited. The integration of this specific framework with RAG further adds to its originality. It's not groundbreaking in its core components but offers a fresh and potentially more comprehensive combination."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, RAG) and relevant literature. The multi-level methodology is well-reasoned, addressing hallucinations at different semantic levels. The mathematical formulations represent standard contrastive loss approaches. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines, diverse metrics (automatic, human, efficiency), multiple scenarios, and crucial ablation studies to validate individual components. The plan to create a specialized dataset, while challenging, is methodologically sound for supervised contrastive learning."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. Creating a high-quality dataset of 10,000 paired factual/hallucinated examples requires significant human effort and expertise, representing a potential bottleneck. Fine-tuning foundation models (even 8B parameter ones) with multiple contrastive losses and RAG integration demands substantial computational resources (GPU time, memory). The extensive evaluation plan, including human assessment and ablation studies, is also resource-intensive. However, the techniques used are established, and the proposed model scale (Llama 3-8B) is manageable within a typical research environment, making the project ambitious but achievable with adequate resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses hallucination, one of the most critical barriers to the trustworthy deployment of foundation models in real-world, high-stakes applications (as emphasized by the task description). Successfully reducing hallucinations, especially via a preventative training-phase approach that minimizes inference overhead (as claimed), would be a major advancement. This research has the potential to significantly increase trust in AI, enable safer deployment in critical sectors like healthcare and law, and contribute valuable insights to responsible AI development."
