        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's focus on FM reliability in the wild, specifically tackling hallucinations as requested. The methodology clearly elaborates on the research idea's multi-level contrastive learning and RAG integration. It acknowledges and positions itself relative to the cited literature, aiming to build upon existing contrastive learning and RAG approaches for hallucination mitigation by proposing a specific multi-level framework. The emphasis on domain-specific applications and efficiency also matches the task description's requirements for real-world deployment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The introduction sets the context well, objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology follows a logical progression (data, training, integration, evaluation). The algorithmic steps provide a good overview. However, some areas could benefit from refinement. The specifics of implementing contrastive learning at each level (e.g., precise representation extraction methods, negative sampling strategies, how source reliability is defined and represented) lack detail. The mathematical formulation for the contrastive loss is generic and doesn't specify adaptations for each level. The RAG integration details are also high-level. Despite these points, the core concepts and overall plan are understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While contrastive learning and RAG are known techniques used for hallucination (as shown in the literature review), the specific combination of *three distinct levels* (token, statement, source-reliability) within a unified contrastive learning framework applied during training appears novel. Existing works focus on model-level contrastive learning, multimodal contrastive learning, or RAG mechanisms/detection. The inclusion of a 'source-reliability' level adds a unique dimension compared to approaches focusing solely on content factuality. The novelty is clearly distinguished from prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, relying on established techniques like contrastive learning and RAG. The evaluation plan includes appropriate metrics. However, there are weaknesses. The success heavily depends on creating a high-quality, specialized hallucination dataset with labels for facts/hallucinations and source reliability, the process for which is not detailed and presents significant challenges. Defining and implementing the 'source-reliability' contrastive learning component effectively is conceptually difficult and lacks concrete formulation. The potential interactions (positive or negative) between the three contrastive levels and their integration with the base FM objective and RAG are not fully explored. The provided contrastive loss function is generic and may require significant adaptation for each level."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. The core components (FMs, contrastive learning, RAG) are technically implementable with existing libraries. However, the primary challenge lies in data preparation: creating the large-scale, multi-level annotated dataset (factual vs. hallucination pairs, source reliability labels) is a substantial undertaking requiring significant resources and potentially novel annotation methodologies. Training such a complex model will be computationally intensive, potentially conflicting with the stated goal of maintaining efficiency. Evaluating hallucination robustly across different domains also remains challenging."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Hallucination is a critical bottleneck for the reliable deployment of foundation models in real-world scenarios, especially high-stakes domains, aligning perfectly with the workshop's theme. Developing methods to mitigate hallucinations *during* the learning process, as proposed, rather than solely relying on post-hoc checks, represents a major advancement. Success would significantly enhance FM trustworthiness and usability, potentially enabling wider adoption in sensitive applications. The research addresses a key challenge highlighted in the literature review and has clear potential for impactful contributions to AI safety and reliability."
