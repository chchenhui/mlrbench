        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description (Workshop on FMs in the Wild). It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of 'Reliability and Responsibility' (Question 2) by proposing concrete methods to tackle hallucination and privacy issues in FM deployment. It also touches upon 'Safety, Ethics, and Fairness' (Question 3) through its privacy-preserving components and implicitly considers 'Practical Limitations' (Question 4) by aiming for lightweight estimators and low overhead. The focus on real-world deployment challenges like OOD queries, reliability, and privacy fits perfectly within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation is explicitly stated, outlining the problems of hallucination and privacy leaks. The proposed solution, a hybrid framework with two distinct components (uncertainty-aware retrieval and privacy filtering), is clearly articulated. Potential technical approaches (BNN, ensembles, NER, redaction, DP) are suggested, and the expected outcomes (reduced hallucination, enhanced privacy) are specified. The overall concept is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While individual components like uncertainty estimation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), privacy filtering (NER/redaction), and differential privacy exist in prior work, the novelty lies in their specific integration into a unified framework explicitly designed for reliable and private FM deployment. Combining uncertainty-triggered RAG to combat hallucinations with proactive input privacy filtering and DP-protected retrieval addresses multiple facets of trustworthy deployment simultaneously. It's a thoughtful synthesis and application of existing techniques to a critical problem area, offering a fresh perspective on holistic FM reliability."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Techniques for uncertainty estimation (ensembles, approximate Bayesian methods), RAG, NER-based PII detection, token redaction, and differential privacy are established research areas with existing implementations. However, integrating these components effectively poses engineering challenges. Ensuring the uncertainty estimator is both reliable and 'lightweight', calibrating the confidence threshold appropriately, implementing DP for retrieval without excessive overhead or utility loss, and managing the latency of the combined system require careful design and experimentation. Access to relevant domain-specific knowledge bases is also necessary for the retrieval component. Overall, it's feasible but requires significant engineering effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing FM reliability (specifically hallucinations) and privacy leaks tackles two of the most critical barriers to deploying these powerful models in sensitive, high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, as mentioned in the motivation. Improving trustworthiness and safety in real-world, unpredictable scenarios (OOD queries) is paramount for responsible AI adoption. A successful implementation of this framework could lead to major advancements in deploying FMs safely and effectively, directly contributing to the goals outlined in the workshop description."
