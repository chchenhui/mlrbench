        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on FMs in the wild, emphasizing reliability and responsibility (Question 2), which directly includes addressing hallucination. The idea proposes a specific method to reduce hallucinations, a core reliability issue mentioned explicitly in the workshop's scope. It also touches upon domain-specific applications and efficiency considerations, relevant to Questions 1 and 4 respectively. The motivation clearly links the problem of hallucinations to real-world deployment risks, fitting the workshop's theme perfectly."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly states the motivation (hallucination as a reliability issue), the core proposal (multi-level contrastive learning), the specific levels involved (token, statement, source-reliability), the required data (paired factual/hallucinated examples), and the intended integration (RAG). The expected outcomes are also defined. While specific implementation details (e.g., exact loss functions, dataset construction methodology) are omitted, this is expected for an abstract-level idea. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise mechanism of source-reliability contrastive learning, but the overall concept is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While contrastive learning itself is not new, and applying it to improve factuality or reduce hallucinations has been explored, the proposed *multi-level* framework (token, statement, source-reliability) specifically designed for hallucination reduction during training/fine-tuning offers a fresh perspective. Combining these different granularities of contrastive objectives within a single framework, particularly including source reliability, represents a novel approach compared to simpler contrastive methods or post-hoc filtering techniques. It's an innovative combination and application of existing concepts to a specific, challenging problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Contrastive learning frameworks are well-established, and integrating them into FM training/fine-tuning pipelines is achievable, albeit computationally intensive (standard for FM research). Retrieval-augmented generation is also a known technique. The primary feasibility challenge lies in constructing the required 'specialized hallucination detection dataset' with reliable paired examples across the three proposed levels (token, statement, source). Creating such a dataset at scale could be resource-intensive and complex, requiring careful annotation or sophisticated generation methods. However, assuming access to adequate resources for dataset creation and model training, the core technical approach is practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Hallucination is widely recognized as one of the most critical barriers to the reliable deployment of foundation models in real-world, high-stakes applications (healthcare, finance, legal). Developing methods that fundamentally reduce the propensity of models to hallucinate during the learning phase, rather than just detecting it post-hoc, would represent a major advancement. Success in this research could significantly enhance FM trustworthiness and safety, directly addressing a core concern highlighted in the workshop description (Reliability and Responsibility) and enabling broader, safer adoption of FMs."
