        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses the 'Synthetic Data and Model Collapse' topic explicitly listed in the workshop's call for papers. It focuses on understanding and mitigating model collapse arising from synthetic data usage in Foundation Models (FMs), proposing both theoretical investigation (dynamical systems) and practical mitigation strategies (adaptive curation via RL), perfectly aligning with the workshop's goals of addressing data challenges in the FM pipeline."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. It clearly defines the problem (model collapse), the proposed approach (dynamical systems modeling, RL for adaptive curation, diversity metrics, collision detection), the intended experiments, and expected outcomes. While specific technical details (e.g., exact spectral analysis techniques, RL reward formulation) are high-level, the overall concept and methodology are presented with good clarity and minimal ambiguity, making it readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While model collapse and synthetic data are known research areas, the proposed approach combines several elements in a novel way: 1) Applying dynamical systems theory to explicitly model the *process* of collapse and identify thresholds. 2) Using Reinforcement Learning for *adaptive*, real-time adjustment of data blending based on diversity metrics, moving beyond static ratios. 3) Integrating a 'collision detection' module. This synthesis offers a fresh perspective compared to existing work focusing on static data mixtures or post-hoc analysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Modeling the training dynamics of large FMs using dynamical systems theory, particularly involving spectral analysis, can be computationally intensive and complex. Implementing an RL agent for real-time control of data streams during large-scale training, including efficient calculation of diversity metrics (like feature embedding entropy), requires sophisticated engineering and substantial computational resources. The theoretical linkage between diversity and convergence guarantees might also be difficult to establish rigorously. While plausible as a research project, it requires considerable effort, expertise (in dynamical systems, RL, large-scale ML), and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant. Model collapse is a critical bottleneck limiting the reliable and large-scale use of synthetic data, which is increasingly important for training FMs due to cost, scale, privacy, and data scarcity. Developing principled methods and tools to prevent collapse would be a major advancement, enabling more robust and sustainable FM development. The potential impact extends to various applications, particularly in resource-constrained domains like healthcare and low-resource languages, making the research highly impactful for the field."
