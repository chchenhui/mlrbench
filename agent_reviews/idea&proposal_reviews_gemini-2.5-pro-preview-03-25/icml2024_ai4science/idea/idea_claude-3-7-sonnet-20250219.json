        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses the core theme of the task description: 'Scaling in AI for Scientific Discovery'. It proposes a specific method for *how* scaling can be done (adaptive, physics-informed), tackles the limitations of current scaling ('simply scaling up models often fails'), and suggests benefits related to efficiency and interpretability, touching upon the 'Pareto frontier' mentioned in the task. It aligns perfectly with the interest in exploring novel scaling strategies beyond uniform increases in size for scientific applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is clearly articulated. The motivation is well-defined, contrasting the proposed approach with current limitations. The main idea of 'adaptive physics-informed scaling' is explained, and the three key innovations (regime identification, selective allocation, hierarchical scaling) provide a good structural overview. While the exact implementation mechanisms for these innovations are not detailed, the overall concept and goals are presented with good clarity and minimal ambiguity for a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel approach to scaling AI models in scientific domains. While Physics-Informed ML and model scaling are existing areas, the combination of using physical principles and regime boundaries to *adaptively guide the allocation of model complexity during scaling* is innovative. It moves beyond uniform scaling or standard PINN approaches by proposing a dynamic, non-uniform scaling strategy explicitly linked to the underlying physics. The hierarchical scaling aspect mirroring physical systems also adds to the novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible but presents significant technical challenges. Implementing automatic identification of physical regimes, designing architectures that support selective parameter allocation, and creating effective hierarchical scaling mechanisms will require considerable research and engineering effort. Expertise in both ML and the specific scientific domain is crucial. However, the concepts build upon existing research areas (PINNs, adaptive architectures), and the mention of preliminary positive results suggests initial viability, making it reasonably feasible despite the challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a highly significant problem: the inefficiency and limitations of current scaling methods for complex scientific modeling. If successful, achieving comparable or better accuracy with significantly fewer parameters (as suggested by preliminary results) would represent a major advancement. This could drastically reduce computational costs, enable the modeling of more complex systems, improve model interpretability by linking architecture to physics, and accelerate discovery across various scientific fields reliant on large-scale simulations."
