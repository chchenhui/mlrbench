    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The task explicitly asks about how scaling changes the Pareto frontier of methodology, interpretability, and discovery, and discusses limitations of scaling. The idea directly addresses this by proposing intrinsically interpretable foundation models to tackle the trade-off between scaling (performance) and interpretability, aiming to shift this exact Pareto frontier. It also aligns with mentioned themes like foundation models, large simulated datasets, and enforcing symmetries in AI for Science."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main proposal (intrinsically interpretable foundation models via architectural constraints), examples (physics-aligned attention, modular components), training approach (simulated data, symmetries), and evaluation criteria (accuracy, explanation fidelity) are well-defined. Minor ambiguities might exist in the precise implementation details of the 'domain-informed architectural constraints' or how modularity guarantees clarity at scale, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While foundation models, interpretability techniques, and physics-informed ML exist, the proposal to build *intrinsically* interpretable foundation models specifically for science, using domain-informed architectural constraints (like physics-aligned attention or modularity for dynamic scaling/clarity) represents a novel integration. It moves beyond common post-hoc interpretability methods and tackles the challenge directly within the model architecture at scale, offering a fresh perspective on the scaling vs. transparency problem in scientific AI."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Building and training foundation models requires substantial computational resources and large datasets (though using simulated data helps). Designing novel architectural constraints that enforce interpretability *without* crippling performance or scalability is technically demanding. Integrating domain knowledge (like physics) deeply into the architecture adds complexity. Evaluating 'explanation fidelity' robustly is also non-trivial. While the components exist, their successful integration at scale is ambitious and requires considerable effort and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Lack of interpretability is a major barrier to the adoption and trust of large-scale AI models in critical scientific domains. Successfully developing scalable models that retain intrinsic interpretability would be a major advancement, potentially accelerating scientific discovery by providing tools that are both powerful and understandable. Addressing the performance-interpretability trade-off directly targets a fundamental challenge in trustworthy AI, especially relevant for scientific applications where understanding mechanisms is crucial."
