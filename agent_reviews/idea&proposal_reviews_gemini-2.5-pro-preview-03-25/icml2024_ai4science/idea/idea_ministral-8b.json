    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Scaling in AI for Scientific Discovery' by proposing the development of 'Scalable Foundation Models'. It explicitly tackles how scaling can be done (scalable architectures, data fusion) and how it can help (enhanced efficiency, accelerate discovery), which are key questions posed in the task description. The focus on multi-modal data and interdisciplinary applications also aligns with the workshop's goal of fostering synergy across scientific fields."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is generally clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main components (data fusion, scalable architectures, interpretability), and expected outcomes are outlined. However, the description of the specific methodologies remains high-level. For instance, 'advanced techniques to fuse data' and 'designing deep learning architectures' lack specific details on the proposed innovations or approaches beyond mentioning transfer learning and model compression. Further elaboration on the concrete technical methods would enhance clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses good novelty. While foundation models, multi-modal learning, and AI for science are individually active research areas, the specific focus on building *scalable*, *multi-modal* foundation models tailored for *broad scientific discovery* with integrated *interpretability* represents a novel synthesis and application focus. It's not proposing entirely new algorithms from scratch but rather an innovative combination and adaptation of existing advanced concepts to address a specific, challenging domain."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is satisfactory but presents significant challenges. Building large-scale foundation models requires immense computational resources and massive, curated datasets. Integrating diverse scientific multi-modal data (text, images, sensor data, potentially omics, simulations, etc.) poses substantial technical hurdles in terms of data alignment, representation learning, and fusion. Ensuring meaningful interpretability in such complex models is also a major, unsolved research problem. Access to suitable large-scale, multi-modal scientific data across different domains might also be a bottleneck. The ambition is high, making implementation non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Successfully developing scalable, multi-modal foundation models for science could fundamentally change how research is conducted across numerous fields. It addresses the critical bottleneck of data volume and complexity in modern science. Enabling efficient analysis, hypothesis generation, and insight extraction from diverse data sources could dramatically accelerate scientific discovery and foster interdisciplinary breakthroughs. The potential impact is substantial."
