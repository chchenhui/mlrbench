    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses the core themes of the task description. It focuses on scaling AI for science, explicitly tackles the trade-off between scaling, interpretability, and discovery (a key question raised), and investigates the limitations of scaling (loss of interpretability) while proposing a potential solution ('Interpretability-Aware Scaling'). It aligns perfectly with the interest areas mentioned, particularly 'How scaling change the Pareto frontier of methodology, interpretability and discovery?' and 'What is the limitation of scaling and what is the cure for it?'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is clearly articulated. The motivation (scaling vs. interpretability trade-off in science) is well-defined, and the main concept ('Interpretability-Aware Scaling') is understandable. It outlines potential methodological directions (physics-informed constraints, causal discovery, concept bottlenecks) and evaluation criteria (joint metrics for performance and interpretability). While specific implementation details are not fully elaborated (expected for an idea summary), the overall goal and approach are communicated effectively with minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "While research on interpretability, scaling laws, and specific techniques like physics-informed ML or concept bottlenecks exists individually, the novelty lies in the proposed synthesis. Specifically, framing interpretability as a quantifiable objective *during* the scaling process for scientific discovery, rather than just post-hoc analysis, is innovative. Developing methods and metrics to systematically explore the Pareto frontier between scale/performance and scientific interpretability represents a fresh perspective on managing the trade-offs inherent in applying large models to science."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is conceptually feasible, building on existing techniques. However, practical implementation presents significant challenges. Integrating interpretability constraints or modules (like causal discovery or concept bottlenecks) into the training loop of very large models can be computationally expensive and technically complex. Defining robust, quantifiable metrics for 'interpretability' and 'discovery potential' that scale effectively is non-trivial. Successfully executing this would require substantial computational resources and expertise in both large-scale ML and interpretability methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a highly significant problem in AI for Science. As models scale, their black-box nature often hinders scientific understanding, trust, and hypothesis generation, limiting their utility beyond prediction. Developing methods to maintain or enhance interpretability during scaling could unlock the potential of large AI models as genuine tools for scientific discovery, leading to major advancements and deeper insights across various scientific domains. It tackles a critical bottleneck for the field."
