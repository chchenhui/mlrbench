    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the task (scaling AI for science, methodology-interpretability-discovery frontier, limitations of scaling) within the context of Molecular Dynamics (MD). It faithfully expands on the three-stage pipeline outlined in the research idea. Furthermore, it is well-grounded in the provided literature, citing relevant works on equivariant models (Equiformer, NequIP, Allegro), scaling laws, active learning, and interpretability, and explicitly aims to address challenges identified in the literature review (e.g., computational cost, interpretability bottlenecks)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The overall objective, the three distinct stages of the methodology (SE(3)-Eformer, DiaSL, ACRe), and the experimental plan are articulated precisely and logically. Key concepts are explained, and relevant equations are provided for the core components like the attention mechanism and loss function. The structure is easy to follow, progressing from introduction and motivation to detailed methodology and expected impact. Minor technical details could be further elaborated (e.g., specifics of the RL controller for DiaSL), but the proposal is immediately understandable without significant ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty, primarily through the synergistic integration of three key components: E(3)-equivariant Transformers, physics-informed adaptive scaling laws (DiaSL), and uncertainty-driven active sampling (ACRe), specifically tailored for creating a scalable foundation model for MD. While the SE(3)-Eformer builds heavily on existing work like Equiformer, the proposed DiaSL mechanism (extending arXiv:2302.23456 with dynamic adaptation) and the ACRe strategy (specific combination of UQ, motif identification, and Metadynamics integration) introduce original elements. The main innovation lies in the unified framework designed to systematically address the scaling challenge in MD by combining these techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations, including E(3) equivariance, attention mechanisms, established ML scaling principles, uncertainty quantification techniques (MC dropout, ensembles), and active learning concepts. The methodology for each stage is well-justified and builds upon cited literature (e.g., Equiformer, physics-informed scaling laws, UQ methods). The technical formulations presented (attention, loss) appear correct. While the empirical validation and precise calibration of the novel DiaSL and ACRe components are necessary and represent areas where rigor must be demonstrated during execution, the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. It requires substantial computational resources (2,000 A100 GPU hours, DGX clusters) and large datasets (existing + generated), which are demanding but standard for this scale of research. The underlying technologies (equivariant GNNs, Transformers, MD simulations, UQ methods) exist. However, the successful integration of the three stages, particularly the development and calibration of the adaptive DiaSL controller and the ACRe active learning loop, represents significant technical complexity and potential bottlenecks. Achieving the ambitious performance targets also adds to the challenge."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it tackles the critical bottleneck of scaling AI models for scientific discovery, specifically within the computationally demanding field of molecular dynamics. Addressing the trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and interpretability is crucial. Success would yield substantial impact: methodologically, by providing a new paradigm for principled, physics-guided scaling of AI models in science; and scientifically, by potentially accelerating drug discovery and materials science through more efficient and accurate MD simulations. The goal of enhancing interpretability alongside scalability further increases its significance."
