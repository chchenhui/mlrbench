    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the task (scaling AI for science, Pareto frontier, limitations), faithfully elaborates on the research idea's three-stage pipeline, and effectively integrates concepts and addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review (equivariance, scaling laws, active learning, computational cost). All components are well-integrated and contextually relevant."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The three-stage methodology is broken down into understandable steps with specific technical details (architecture, loss function, scaling strategy, active learning process). The experimental design is thorough. Minor ambiguities, such as the precise nature of the tensor product in the attention formula, are negligible in the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits notable originality by integrating three distinct but complementary areas: equivariant architectures (extending Equiformer), physics-informed scaling laws, and active learning for molecular dynamics. While the individual components draw from existing work (cited appropriately), their synergistic combination into a unified framework specifically designed for scaling foundation models in MD is innovative. It offers a fresh perspective on tackling computational bottlenecks in AI for science."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (equivariance, scaling laws, uncertainty quantification) and established methods from the literature. The proposed methodology, including the equivariant transformer extension, scaling strategy, and active learning loop, is well-reasoned. The experimental plan is robust, including relevant benchmarks, metrics, and ablation studies. The reliance on empirical validation for scaling triggers and active learning effectiveness is appropriate for this type of research."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The proposal faces significant feasibility challenges, primarily due to the immense computational cost associated with generating the initial dataset (10 million DFT calculations) and training/scaling large equivariant models. While the techniques themselves are established, the proposed scale requires substantial, potentially prohibitive, computational resources and time. The active learning loop, involving iterative DFT calculations and retraining, also adds complexity and cost. Successful implementation is heavily contingent on access to large-scale computing infrastructure."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses a critical challenge in computational science: the efficient and accurate simulation of molecular dynamics using AI. Success would represent a major advancement, potentially redefining the accuracy-cost Pareto frontier for MD simulations and accelerating drug discovery and materials science. The proposed framework for integrating physical symmetries and scaling laws also offers valuable methodological contributions to the broader AI for Science field, demonstrating principled scaling beyond naive approaches."
