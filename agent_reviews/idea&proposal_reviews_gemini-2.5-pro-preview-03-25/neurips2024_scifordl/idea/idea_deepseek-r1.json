    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea aligns perfectly with the task description. The workshop calls for submissions using the scientific method (hypothesis testing, controlled experiments) for empirical analysis to understand deep learning. This idea proposes exactly that: forming a hypothesis (attention heads as 'task experts' in ICL), designing controlled experiments (systematic ablation studies), and using empirical results to validate or falsify the hypothesis. It directly addresses listed topics like 'in-context learning in transformers' and '(mechanistic) interpretability', fitting the workshop's core goals precisely."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (understanding ICL mechanisms), the central hypothesis (specialized attention heads as 'task experts'), the proposed methodology (systematic ablation, performance measurement, attention pattern analysis, scaling studies), and the expected outcomes (identifying critical heads, testing the hypothesis). The steps are logical and the overall goal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While ablation studies are a known technique in interpretability research, the systematic application to rigorously test the specific hypothesis of 'task expert' attention heads within the context of in-context learning across diverse tasks and model scales is a focused and valuable contribution. It builds upon prior work analyzing attention heads but directs the investigation towards a specific, debated mechanism underlying ICL, offering fresh perspectives on how this capability emerges and functions."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Training or fine-tuning transformer variants is standard practice, although potentially resource-intensive for large models or extensive scaling studies. The core experimental technique, ablating attention heads during inference, is computationally straightforward. Performance evaluation and attention pattern analysis are also standard procedures. Access to pre-trained models can mitigate some training costs. The main challenge lies in the scale of experiments (multiple tasks, model sizes, ablation targets), requiring significant computational resources, but the core methodology uses existing, well-understood techniques."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. In-context learning is a defining, yet poorly understood, capability of modern large language models. Uncovering the mechanisms behind ICL, specifically testing the role of attention heads, addresses a fundamental question in the field. Validating or falsifying the 'task expert' hypothesis would provide crucial insights into transformer function, potentially leading to major advancements in model interpretability, efficiency (e.g., through targeted pruning), and the design of models with better ICL capabilities, especially smaller ones."
