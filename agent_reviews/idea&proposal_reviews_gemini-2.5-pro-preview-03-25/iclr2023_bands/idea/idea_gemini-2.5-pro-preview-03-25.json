        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core question of 'How can we develop a general defense method against a variety of backdoor attacks and even unseen attacks?' which is explicitly mentioned in the task overview. The motivation highlights the limitations of existing trigger-specific defenses and the need for universal mechanisms, especially for large models, echoing the concerns raised in the task description. It fits squarely within the workshop's scope, particularly the topics related to detecting backdoored models and developing general defenses."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The core concept – that backdoor triggers induce anomalous activation trajectories – is stated plainly. The proposed method (monitoring activation sequences, modeling normal trajectories with sequence models like recurrent autoencoders/TCNs, detecting deviations) is clearly outlined. The motivation and expected outcome are well-articulated. The mention of applicability in black-box scenarios by analyzing output probabilities over sequential processing is slightly less detailed but still conveys the intended direction. Overall, the idea is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using activations for backdoor defense exists (e.g., activation clustering, outlier detection), the specific focus on analyzing the *temporal dynamics* or *trajectories* of activations across multiple layers using sequence modeling techniques (RNNs, TCNs) appears novel in the context of backdoor defense. Most existing activation-based methods focus on static patterns or statistics at specific points. Modeling the evolution of activations as a sequence to detect anomalies caused by triggers offers a fresh perspective compared to trigger reconstruction or input filtering methods. It represents a new combination of sequence anomaly detection and backdoor defense principles."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents implementation challenges. Monitoring activations is standard in white-box settings. Modeling sequences with recurrent autoencoders or TCNs is technically feasible. However, challenges include: 1) Defining and robustly modeling the distribution of 'normal' trajectories, especially with only unlabeled or limited clean data, which might be noisy or contain outliers. 2) The computational overhead of monitoring and processing activation sequences for every input, particularly in deep networks, could be significant for real-time applications. 3) The claim of black-box applicability via 'output probabilities over sequential processing' needs more concrete definition and validation; its feasibility is less certain than the white-box approach. 4) Ensuring the method is sensitive enough to detect subtle trigger effects without generating excessive false positives on benign inputs exhibiting natural variations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. A successful universal, attack-agnostic backdoor defense would address a critical vulnerability in modern ML, especially for widely deployed large pre-trained models where retraining is impractical. It directly tackles the limitation of existing defenses being tailored to specific attack types. If proven effective, particularly with limited clean data, it could lead to major advancements in ML security and trustworthiness, providing a much-needed general protection mechanism against a pervasive threat."
