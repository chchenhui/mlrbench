    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the need for general defense methods against diverse and unseen backdoor attacks, a key question posed in the task description ('How can we develop a general defense method against a variety of backdoor attacks and even unseen attacks?'). It also tackles the challenge of adapting defenses across different domains (CV, NLP, FL), another central theme highlighted ('Can [existing defense techniques] be adapted to other domains?'). The focus on detecting backdoored models with limited clean data aligns perfectly with the listed workshop topics ('Detecting backdoored models under different threat models, such as having limited clean data...'). The proposal explicitly mentions targeting CV, NLP, and FL, which are core areas mentioned in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (meta-learning for domain-agnostic detection using latent activations), training process (simulation, anomaly detection, meta-aggregation), and deployment strategy (few-shot fine-tuning on clean data) are understandable. However, some aspects could be more precise. For instance, the specific type of meta-learning algorithm, the nature of the 'small anomaly detector', the method for generating 'synthetic triggers' across diverse domains, and the exact mechanism by which 'universal backdoor irregularities' are captured remain high-level. Minor refinements clarifying these implementation details would improve precision."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like analyzing latent activations for backdoor detection and meta-learning exist independently, their combination to create a *domain-agnostic* backdoor detector adaptable with few clean samples is innovative. Most existing defenses are tailored to specific domains (primarily vision) or attack types. The core novelty lies in leveraging meta-learning to explicitly learn a generalizable representation of backdoor anomalies across modalities (CV, NLP, FL) and enabling fast adaptation to new, unseen domains or trigger types without requiring poisoned samples during deployment. This cross-modal, few-shot adaptation approach offers a fresh perspective compared to existing work."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Using meta-learning and analyzing activations are established techniques. The few-shot adaptation using only clean data is an attractive practical feature. However, the meta-training phase requires simulating diverse poisoning scenarios across multiple complex domains (CV, NLP, FL), which demands substantial resources, varied datasets, and representative models. Generating realistic and effective synthetic triggers across these domains is non-trivial. Furthermore, the core assumption that universal, domain-agnostic backdoor signatures exist within latent activations and can be effectively captured by meta-learning needs empirical validation, as backdoor manifestations might vary significantly across tasks and architectures. Success hinges on the quality and diversity of the meta-training setup."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical vulnerability in the widespread deployment of pre-trained models: the lack of generalizable backdoor defenses. As highlighted in the task description, backdoor attacks pose a major threat across various domains, and existing defenses often fall short against diverse or unseen attacks. A successful MetaShield could provide a practical, unified solution for detecting backdoors in models from various sources and domains (including emerging ones like FL), requiring minimal domain-specific knowledge or data at deployment. This would be a major advancement in ML security and trustworthiness, directly contributing to safeguarding the ML ecosystem."
