    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for general defense methods against diverse and unseen backdoor attacks, particularly focusing on cross-domain applicability (CV, NLP, FL) and practicality (limited clean data). The methodology elaborates precisely on the research idea (MetaShield using meta-learning for domain-agnostic detection). It acknowledges and aims to overcome the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as domain specificity, adaptability, and data efficiency, positioning itself clearly against existing work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The problem, motivation, objectives, and overall framework (MetaShield) are presented logically and are easy to understand. The experimental design is comprehensive and clearly outlined. However, some technical details could be more precise, particularly the exact formulation of the domain-agnostic feature transformation function 'psi' (beyond conceptual description of normalization, moments, topology) and the specific contrastive loss function used in the inner loop of MAML. Despite these minor points, the core concepts and plan are communicated effectively."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While meta-learning for backdoor detection has been explored (as noted in the hypothetical literature review items [6] and [10]), this proposal's novelty lies in its explicit focus on *cross-modal* training (CV, NLP, FL) to achieve *domain-agnostic* detection. The combination of meta-learning (MAML) with a specific strategy for extracting potentially domain-invariant features from penultimate layer activations (using statistics and topology via 'psi') and the emphasis on few-shot adaptation using only clean data represents a fresh approach. It's an innovative synthesis and application of existing concepts to address a specific gap, rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established techniques like meta-learning (MAML) and activation analysis. The methodology follows a logical progression. However, the core assumption – the existence and learnability of sufficiently strong *domain-invariant* backdoor signatures in penultimate layer activations across diverse domains like CV, NLP, and FL – is ambitious and requires strong empirical validation. The justification for the specific components of the feature transformation 'psi' (statistical moments, topology) could be stronger, and its precise formulation is missing. The experimental plan is rigorous and designed to test the core hypotheses, which strengthens the soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Generating backdoored models across different domains, extracting activations, and implementing MAML are achievable with standard ML libraries and computational resources (though meta-training will be intensive). The design emphasizes a lightweight detector and few-shot adaptation, enhancing deployment feasibility. The main risk lies in the research hypothesis itself: if domain-invariant signatures are too weak or noisy, the approach might not yield the desired performance. The success of the feature transformation 'psi' might require significant experimentation. However, the plan to investigate this is realistic for a research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem in ML security. Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat, especially with the proliferation of pre-trained models. The lack of effective, generalizable, and data-efficient defenses is a critical gap. If successful, a domain-agnostic, few-shot backdoor detector would represent a major advancement with substantial practical impact, enhancing trust and security across diverse ML applications. The potential contributions to both practical defense mechanisms and the theoretical understanding of cross-domain backdoor characteristics are substantial."
