    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for general defense methods against diverse and unseen backdoor attacks across multiple domains (CV, NLP, FL), the need for defenses effective with limited clean data, and the challenge of securing pre-trained models. The methodology clearly implements the core research idea of using meta-learning for domain-agnostic detection. It effectively synthesizes the literature, citing relevant works on domain-specific defenses (TextGuard), advanced attacks (ReVeil, BELT), FL vulnerabilities (arXiv:2308.04466), cross-domain issues (arXiv:2403.67890), and prior meta-learning detection approaches (arXiv:2405.12345, arXiv:2407.98765), positioning MetaShield as a solution to the identified key challenges (domain specificity, adaptability, data efficiency)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology (meta-training, fine-tuning, deployment), experimental setup (datasets, baselines, metrics), and expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The structure is logical, flowing from background to conclusion. Mathematical formulations for MAML and the task loss are provided. Minor areas could benefit from slight refinement: the exact mechanism of the contrastive adaptation loss could be elaborated further, and the justification for relying solely on penultimate layer activations across diverse architectures could be strengthened. However, these are minor points, and the overall proposal is easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While meta-learning for backdoor detection has been explored (arXiv:2405.12345, arXiv:2407.98765), this proposal's novelty lies in its explicit focus on *cross-modal generalization* (CV, NLP, FL) and learning *domain-agnostic* signatures via MAML trained on diverse tasks. The combination of meta-learning for universality and few-shot adaptation using only clean data (via contrastive learning on activations) presents a fresh approach to tackle the limitations of domain-specific defenses highlighted in the literature review. It's a novel application and combination of existing techniques to address a specific, challenging gap."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid foundations: meta-learning (MAML), anomaly detection based on activations (a common backdoor defense strategy), and contrastive learning. The methodology is logical, and the experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics. The mathematical formulations appear correct. The primary assumption – that universal backdoor signatures exist and are learnable from penultimate layer activations across different modalities using MAML – is a strong but reasonable hypothesis central to the research question. While this requires thorough empirical validation, the overall approach is technically well-grounded and justified by related work."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard datasets, widely available pre-trained models, and established ML techniques (MAML, MLP classifiers, contrastive learning). The required computational resources are typical for deep learning research. Implementing the framework using standard libraries is achievable. The few-shot requirement for deployment enhances practical feasibility. The main risk is scientific rather than technical: the core hypothesis about learnable cross-modal signatures might not hold as strongly as hoped, potentially limiting performance against very diverse or stealthy attacks. However, the research plan itself is practical and implementable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the lack of generalizable defenses against backdoor attacks in an era of widespread pre-trained models across diverse domains (CV, NLP, FL, etc.), as emphasized in the task description and literature. A successful MetaShield would represent a major advancement, offering a practical, adaptable, and data-efficient tool for securing ML systems. It has the potential to influence how backdoor defenses are developed and deployed, moving beyond domain-specific solutions. The planned release of code and datasets further enhances its potential impact on the research community."
