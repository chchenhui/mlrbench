    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for general, cross-domain backdoor defenses effective against unseen attacks with limited data. It faithfully elaborates on the core research idea of using meta-learning for domain-agnostic detection. Furthermore, it explicitly references relevant literature (e.g., TextGuard, Backdoor FL, meta-learning for detection) and positions itself to tackle the key challenges identified in the review, such as domain-specificity, adaptability, and data efficiency. The chosen domains (CV, NLP, FL, RL) and the focus on pre-trained models align perfectly with the context provided."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Research objectives are explicitly listed and measurable. The methodology is presented with a logical structure, detailing data collection, the MAML-based meta-learning framework (including the objective function), feature extraction, anomaly detector design, and deployment steps. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying domains, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Expected outcomes are quantified, and the potential impact is clearly articulated. The language is precise, and the overall structure facilitates easy understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While meta-learning for backdoor detection has been explored ([6], [10] in the literature review), this proposal distinctively focuses on *cross-modal* generalization (CV, NLP, FL, potentially RL) by learning *universal* backdoor signatures from latent activations. The aim to achieve domain-agnostic detection that adapts rapidly using only a few *clean* samples, without needing trigger examples or reverse-engineering, represents a significant advancement over many existing domain-specific or data-hungry methods. The combination of MAML, cross-modal activation analysis, and few-shot clean-data adaptation for backdoor detection is innovative."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It leverages established techniques like MAML for meta-learning and anomaly detection on latent features. The methodology is well-described, and the experimental plan is thorough, including appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablations. However, the core premise rests on the assumption that backdoor poisoning induces 'subtle but universal perturbations' in latent activations across diverse domains and trigger types (pixel patches, text tokens, parameter perturbations). This universality is a strong assumption that requires substantial empirical validation, representing the main potential weakness in the theoretical foundation. The technical formulation (MAML equation) appears correct, but the practical success hinges heavily on this core assumption holding true across the proposed modalities."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It relies on standard datasets, common ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow), and established algorithms (MAML, MLP, PCA). The computational resources required for meta-training, while potentially significant, are within the typical range for deep learning research. The deployment requirement of only a few clean samples significantly enhances its practical feasibility. Implementation complexity exists, particularly in setting up the diverse meta-training tasks, but it does not require fundamentally new technologies. The main risk is scientific (validity of the universality assumption) rather than purely implementational."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of generalizable and practical defenses against backdoor attacks in the rapidly expanding ecosystem of pre-trained models across various domains. A successful outcome would provide a valuable, unified tool for enhancing ML security, potentially impacting the trustworthiness of model repositories and informing security standards. By aiming for a cross-domain solution, it pushes the field beyond siloed approaches and could inspire further research into generalizable ML defenses. The potential impact on both research and practice is substantial."
