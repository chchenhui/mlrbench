        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics listed for the workshop, including Stochastic Optimal Control, Diffusion Models, Stochastic Processes, and Neural SDEs. It explicitly aims to bridge machine learning (diffusion models) with control theory (SOC) and dynamical systems, which is the central theme of the workshop ('New Frontiers in Learning, Control, and Dynamical Systems'). The proposal tackles the challenge of scalability in control using modern deep learning techniques, fitting squarely within the workshop's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and very well-defined. The motivation (limitations of HJB PDEs, strengths of diffusion models) is concisely stated. The core mechanism (learning score of optimal trajectories via DSM, using reverse SDE for control) is explained logically and step-by-step. The objectives, proposed method, and validation strategy are clearly articulated. While implementation details would require further specification in a full paper, the research concept itself is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While using diffusion models for control/RL is an emerging area, the specific approach of learning the score function of the *distribution of optimal trajectories* (∇ₓ log p*(τ)) and using a reverse SDE to sample control policies directly appears innovative. It offers a distinct perspective compared to methods focusing solely on state distributions or direct policy parameterization via diffusion. It cleverly reframes the SOC problem in the language of score-based generative modeling, representing a fresh combination of existing concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology but presents moderate implementation challenges. Key components like denoising score matching and SDE solvers are established. However, feasibility hinges on: 1) The ability to generate sufficiently high-quality 'pseudo ground-truth' trajectories using ADP or MPC, which can be computationally expensive or inaccurate in high dimensions. The quality of these initial trajectories will directly impact the learned score function. 2) The computational cost of training the score model on potentially complex, high-dimensional trajectory data. 3) The practical efficiency of sampling control trajectories via the reverse SDE at inference – the claim of needing 'just a few diffusion steps' requires empirical validation, as diffusion sampling can often be slow. Overall, it's implementable but requires careful engineering and validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and challenging problem in control theory: solving high-dimensional stochastic optimal control problems, where traditional methods like solving HJB equations fail due to the curse of dimensionality. By proposing a scalable, data-driven approach leveraging powerful generative models (diffusion models), it could lead to major advancements. Successfully unifying score-based diffusion models with SOC offers a new paradigm for policy synthesis that is potentially more scalable and flexible than existing methods, with broad implications for robotics, autonomous systems, and other complex control tasks."
