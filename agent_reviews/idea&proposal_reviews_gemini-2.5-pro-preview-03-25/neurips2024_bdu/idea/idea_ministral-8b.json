        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task description. It directly addresses the core theme of 'Bayesian Decision-making and Uncertainty'. It highlights the limitations of current AI in handling uncertainty, proposes Bayesian methods as a solution, and specifically leverages the opportunity mentioned in the task description: using frontier models (LLMs) to enhance Bayesian methods with stronger priors. The application areas mentioned (scientific discovery, hyperparameter tuning, environmental monitoring) also directly match those listed in the task description. Furthermore, it acknowledges the challenge of scalability, another point raised in the call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is well-articulated and mostly clear. The motivation, main steps (LLM priors, adaptive inference, evaluation, scalability), and expected outcomes are laid out logically. The core concept of using LLMs to generate priors for Bayesian models is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific mechanisms for translating LLM outputs into formal priors and the exact nature of the 'adaptive Bayesian inference algorithm', but these details are often elaborated upon in a full paper rather than an initial idea description. Overall, the proposal is clearly presented."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While combining LLMs with other ML fields is increasingly common, the specific proposal to use LLMs to generate *context-specific priors* for Bayesian decision-making frameworks is innovative. It moves beyond using LLMs simply for text generation or basic knowledge retrieval, integrating them into the core mechanism of Bayesian inference. The focus on *adaptive* inference using these LLM-derived priors further enhances the novelty. It represents a fresh perspective on improving Bayesian methods by leveraging the implicit knowledge within LLMs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Accessing LLMs and implementing Bayesian methods are individually possible. However, the integration poses hurdles: 1) Reliably extracting structured, quantifiable, and well-calibrated priors from potentially noisy or biased LLM outputs is non-trivial. 2) The computational cost of repeatedly querying LLMs within an adaptive inference loop could be substantial. 3) Scalability, as acknowledged in the proposal, is a major concern, especially for high-dimensional problems. While conceptually sound, practical implementation requires overcoming these considerable technical challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical limitation in modern AI – robust decision-making under uncertainty – which hinders deployment in high-stakes domains. Improving Bayesian methods, particularly prior specification and scalability, is crucial. Leveraging the vast knowledge encoded in LLMs to inform priors could lead to substantial improvements in uncertainty quantification and decision quality, especially in complex, data-sparse, or dynamic environments. Success in the targeted application areas (scientific discovery, HPO, environmental monitoring) would represent major advancements, potentially leading to more reliable and effective AI systems."
