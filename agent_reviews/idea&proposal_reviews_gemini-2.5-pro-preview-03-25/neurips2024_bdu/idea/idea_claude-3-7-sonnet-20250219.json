        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's theme of 'Bayesian Decision-making and Uncertainty'. It directly addresses the core problem highlighted in the task description: the need for models to make reliable decisions that account for uncertainty, especially in critical applications and dynamic environments. The proposed use of Bayesian methods (probability distribution over ensembles, Bayesian updating) fits perfectly with the workshop's focus. It also touches upon relevant challenges like performance guarantees and computational tractability, and aims for robustness in OOD scenarios, all mentioned in the call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly, outlining the motivation, the main concept (adaptive Bayesian ensemble selection), and its key components (meta-learning, utility function, SMC). The goal of dynamically weighting/selecting models based on uncertainty context is well-articulated. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for meta-learning uncertainty patterns or the exact definition of the 'model space' explored by SMC, but the overall research direction and approach are understandable and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by proposing a specific synthesis of existing concepts. While Bayesian methods, ensemble techniques, meta-learning, and decision theory are established fields, their integration into an *adaptive Bayesian selection* framework driven dynamically by uncertainty characteristics (including type: epistemic/aleatoric) and decision context appears innovative. Maintaining and updating a probability distribution over *ensemble configurations* (not just model weights) using SMC for this purpose offers a fresh perspective compared to standard ensemble averaging or static Bayesian model averaging."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the individual components (Bayesian inference, ensembles, meta-learning, SMC) are known, integrating them into a cohesive and efficient system is complex. Scalability is a major concern: maintaining and updating a distribution over ensemble configurations, especially with many models, could be computationally demanding. Achieving the claimed 'computationally tractable for real-time applications' might require substantial optimization or simplification. Meta-learning robust uncertainty patterns across diverse domains is also ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a highly significant problem: improving the reliability of ML decision-making under uncertainty, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous systems. Enhancing uncertainty quantification, calibration, and OOD robustness would be impactful contributions. Success in this research could lead to more trustworthy AI systems and directly aligns with the workshop's goal of tackling critical problems and shaping future directions in Bayesian decision-making."
