        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of Bayesian decision-making, uncertainty, incorporating prior knowledge, and leveraging frontier models (LLMs) for enhancement. The proposal accurately reflects the core research idea of using LLMs for prior elicitation in BO. It effectively uses the provided literature review to motivate the problem, contextualize the proposed solution (LLM-BO-PE), differentiate it from related work (e.g., LLAMBO, multi-task initialization), and acknowledge concurrent efforts in the specific area of LLM-based prior elicitation, thereby showing a deep understanding of the context and prior work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem definition to the proposed solution, methodology, and expected impact. Objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section clearly outlines the three main components (LLM module, BO integration, validation) and details the steps involved, including input/output of the LLM module and the experimental design. The language is precise and technical concepts are explained well. Minor ambiguities typical of proposals (e.g., exact prompt engineering details) do not detract significantly from the overall clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal has satisfactory novelty. While using LLMs to augment Bayesian methods is innovative, the literature review (specifically items 5-9, acknowledged as concurrent work) indicates that the core idea of using LLMs specifically for *prior elicitation* in BO is being explored simultaneously by multiple groups. The proposal correctly acknowledges this context. Therefore, the novelty lies less in the absolute uniqueness of the concept and more in the proposed systematic framework (LLM-BO-PE), the specific focus on translating natural language descriptions into structured GP prior components (kernel, hyperparameters, ARD), and the planned rigorous empirical evaluation. It's a timely and relevant contribution to an emerging area, but not entirely groundbreaking given the concurrent work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations of Bayesian Optimization and Gaussian Processes. The proposed methodology, involving an LLM to suggest prior parameters (kernel, hyperparameters) which are then used to initialize the GP in a standard BO loop, is logical and technically well-founded. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, diverse tasks, appropriate metrics, and considerations for statistical robustness. Potential weaknesses, such as the reliability of LLM outputs and the effectiveness of prompt engineering, are acknowledged as areas for investigation. The technical descriptions related to GPs and BO are appropriate."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The required technologies (LLMs via APIs or open models, BO libraries like BoTorch/GPyTorch) are readily available. The proposed methodology involves integrating existing components, which is technically achievable. The experimental plan, while requiring significant computational effort for multiple BO runs, is standard practice in the field. Key challenges identified, such as prompt engineering and parsing LLM outputs, are practical hurdles that can likely be overcome with careful implementation and iteration. The scope appears realistic for a typical research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and well-known bottleneck in Bayesian Optimization â€“ the difficulty of specifying informative priors. Improving BO efficiency by automating prior elicitation could lead to substantial savings in computational cost and experimental time, particularly impactful in fields like scientific discovery (materials, drugs) and engineering where function evaluations are expensive. Furthermore, it could democratize BO by lowering the expertise barrier. The work also contributes to the understanding of how LLMs can be integrated with established ML algorithms and directly aligns with the workshop's goals of enhancing Bayesian methods using frontier models."
