    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description's focus on Bayesian decision-making, uncertainty, scaling Bayesian methods, and leveraging LLMs for stronger priors. It directly implements the research idea of using LLMs for prior elicitation in BO based on natural language descriptions. Furthermore, it acknowledges and positions itself within the context of the provided literature review, citing relevant recent works and addressing the highlighted challenges. The objectives and methodology directly follow from the idea and fit the workshop's theme."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally clear and well-structured. The background, objectives, methodology (broken into stages), and expected outcomes are articulated logically. The core concepts (LLM prompting, GP priors, EI, validation strategy) are understandable. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanisms for parsing LLM output ('rule-based or fine-tuned classifiers') and the details of the 'adaptation mechanism' for poor priors, but these do not significantly hinder the overall comprehension. The technical formulations provided are standard and clear."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal's novelty is limited due to significant overlap with the provided literature review. Several cited papers (e.g., AutoElicit, LLAMBO, and items 5-10 from 2024/2025) explore the exact same core idea: using LLMs to elicit priors for BO from natural language descriptions, often for similar applications (HPO, materials, drug discovery). The proposal does not sufficiently articulate how its specific framework or approach significantly differs from or improves upon these very recent works. While combining these elements into a specific framework and performing validation is useful, the core conceptual contribution appears incremental rather than groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on sound theoretical foundations (BO, GPs, LLMs) and proposes a logical methodology. The use of standard acquisition functions (EI), benchmark functions, real-world tasks, and relevant baselines for validation is appropriate. The inclusion of an adaptation mechanism and consideration of LLM limitations (hallucinations, bias) demonstrates methodological awareness. However, the soundness relies heavily on the assumption that LLMs can consistently generate high-quality, structured priors from potentially ambiguous natural language across diverse domains, and that the proposed parsing and adaptation mechanisms will be effective, which requires strong empirical validation. The KL divergence metric requires ground-truth priors, which may limit its applicability."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal appears largely feasible. It relies on accessible resources like pre-trained LLMs, standard BO libraries, and benchmark datasets. The technical challenges, such as prompt engineering, parsing LLM outputs, and integrating components, are significant but solvable with current ML/NLP techniques. The proposed validation plan using synthetic and real-world tasks is practical. Potential risks like LLM reliability and computational overhead are acknowledged with mitigation strategies (consistency checks, optimization). The overall plan is realistic for a research project."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem: improving the efficiency and accessibility of Bayesian Optimization, particularly for complex, expensive black-box functions common in scientific discovery and engineering. Automating prior elicitation via LLMs could democratize BO for non-experts and accelerate research by reducing the number of required function evaluations. If successful, the work could have a notable impact on how BO is applied. However, the limited novelty slightly tempers the significance, as it builds upon a rapidly developing area where similar approaches are emerging concurrently."
