    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the HiLD workshop (high-dimensional dynamics, analyzable models, scaling limits, role of optimizers/architectures, geometry vs. intuition). The problem statement, objectives, and methodology perfectly reflect the research idea's focus on using RMT and high-dimensional statistics to characterize loss landscapes, validate empirically, and bridge theory with practice. Furthermore, the proposal explicitly acknowledges and aims to tackle the key challenges identified in the literature review (high-D complexity, validation, dynamics link, metric development, theory-practice gap)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and logically presented. The background, problem statement, and motivation are articulated concisely. The research objectives are specific and well-defined. The methodology section provides significant detail on the theoretical tools (RMT, Kac-Rice), empirical setup (architectures, datasets, measurement techniques like Lanczos), proposed metrics, and evaluation plan. Technical concepts are explained appropriately. While the underlying mathematical concepts are complex, the proposal clearly outlines the intended approach and steps, leaving minimal ambiguity about the research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While it builds upon existing work using established tools like RMT (as cited, e.g., Baskerville et al.), it proposes significant extensions: applying these tools to different architectures and training stages, deriving analytical scaling laws for landscape features, and systematically validating these laws empirically at scale. The development of specific, computable geometry-informed metrics (Spectral Bulk Ratio, PR, Gradient Alignment) derived from high-dimensional theory and the explicit goal of translating these into practical guidelines for optimizer and architecture design represent a novel synthesis and application aimed directly at bridging the theory-practice gap. It offers fresh perspectives beyond simply describing the landscape."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations (RMT, high-dimensional probability, statistical mechanics) and cites relevant, state-of-the-art literature. The proposed methodology is robust, combining theoretical derivations with large-scale, systematic empirical validation. The plan details appropriate mathematical tools and computational techniques (e.g., Lanczos for Hessian spectra). Key technical concepts and target quantities (Hessian spectrum, critical points, gradient alignment) are correctly identified and formulated. The proposal also realistically acknowledges potential challenges (e.g., RMT assumptions, complexity of Kac-Rice adaptation) and outlines mitigation strategies."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. The empirical validation, while computationally intensive (requiring significant resources for training and Hessian analysis across many models/datasets), uses established techniques (Lanczos, auto-diff HVPs) and is technically achievable. However, the theoretical objectives, particularly deriving novel analytical scaling laws for complex architectures or adapting tools like the Kac-Rice formula, are ambitious and carry inherent research risk. Successfully developing metrics and guidelines that demonstrably improve practical optimization (Objective 5) is also challenging. Overall, the plan is generally realistic, but the theoretical components require high expertise and may face difficulties, and the computational cost is substantial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a fundamental and critical problem in deep learning: understanding and improving optimization in high-dimensional parameter spaces, moving beyond flawed low-dimensional intuitions. Success would lead to major advancements in our theoretical understanding of *why* deep learning works. Furthermore, the potential practical impact is substantial, offering the possibility of more principled and efficient optimization algorithms, reduced reliance on hyperparameter tuning, and better neural architecture design. The research directly aligns with and contributes to the core goals of the HiLD community, aiming to bridge the theory-practice gap."
