        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core themes of the workshop (efficient long context, sub-quadratic models, RAG efficiency, KV cache, adaptation). The proposed DySRA-SubQ model directly tackles the challenges outlined in the task description, such as efficient adaptation, long context understanding with query-specific fetching, and KV cache management. It elaborates precisely on the research idea, detailing the dynamic sparse retriever, sub-quadratic backbone, and compressive cache. Furthermore, it effectively positions the work within the context of the provided literature, citing relevant papers on RAG efficiency (AttentionRAG, LongRAG), KV cache compression (RazorAttention, PyramidKV, KV-Compress), and efficient attention (GCA), while clearly articulating its unique contributions, particularly the RL-based dynamic retrieval and the rotating cache for streaming contexts."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes), and the research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides good detail on the overall architecture and the function of each core component (Retriever, Backbone, Cache). The use of RL for the retriever, the concept of sparse attention within a sub-quadratic model, and the rotating compressive cache mechanism are explained conceptually well. However, some areas could benefit from slight refinement: the exact interaction between the sparse attention and the chosen sub-quadratic backbone remains somewhat abstract, and the distinction between the proposed rotating cache and existing methods, while mentioned, could be slightly sharper. The lack of the conceptual diagram placeholder also slightly detracts. Overall, the proposal is understandable and well-defined, with only minor ambiguities typical of a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly original and innovative. While individual components draw inspiration from existing work (sub-quadratic models, RAG, KV cache compression, RL), the specific combination and proposed mechanisms offer significant novelty. Key novel aspects include: 1) The Dynamic Sparse Retriever trained via RL to proactively select minimal token sets based on query relevance and sparsity objectives, differing from post-retrieval pruning or standard dense retrieval. 2) The Rotating Compressive KV Cache designed explicitly for constant memory usage during continuous streaming by compressing and rotating out the *oldest* context segments, distinct from methods compressing the entire current context window. 3) The end-to-end co-optimization strategy for these specific components. The proposal clearly distinguishes its approach from the cited literature, presenting a potentially groundbreaking method for efficient, adaptive long-context processing."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous, based on solid theoretical foundations (Transformers, RAG, RL, sub-quadratic architectures, compression techniques). The motivation is well-established. The proposed methodology for each component is plausible: RL is a valid approach for learning selection policies, integrating sparse attention is technically feasible, and using techniques like low-rank projections for KV compression is established. The hybrid loss function and optimization strategies are standard. Technical formulations (RL objective, attention basics) are correctly presented conceptually. Minor weaknesses include the inherent challenges of RL training (stability, reward design) and the potential information loss from aggressive KV compression, which are acknowledged research risks rather than fundamental flaws in the proposal's logic. The complexity of integrating all components requires careful engineering, but the overall approach is technically well-grounded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While based on existing concepts, integrating a novel RL-based retriever, a modified sub-quadratic backbone with sparse attention, and a custom rotating compressive cache into a co-optimized system is highly complex. Success requires substantial expertise in multiple areas (LLMs, RL, efficient architectures) and significant computational resources for training and large-scale evaluation. Key challenges include stabilizing the RL training, efficiently implementing the cache mechanism without introducing excessive overhead, ensuring effective gradient flow for co-optimization, and managing the complexity of the overall system. While the plan is broken down logically, the technical hurdles and required effort are considerable, introducing non-trivial risks to successful execution within a typical project timeframe or resource constraint."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in current AI: the inability of foundation models to efficiently process and adapt to very long or continuously streaming contexts. The quadratic complexity of Transformers and the added burden of standard RAG limit scalability and real-time applications. Successfully developing the DySRA-SubQ model would represent a major advancement, potentially enabling models with constant memory usage and sub-quadratic compute for long contexts. This could unlock new applications in real-time analysis, long-term conversational AI, and efficient processing of large document corpora. The research directly aligns with pressing needs in the field and the specific goals of the workshop, promising substantial contributions to scalable and adaptive AI."
