        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's core themes, including efficient long context understanding, sub-quadratic models, RAG integration, adaptive fine-tuning/inference, and KV cache management. The proposed DS-RASQ model directly tackles the challenges outlined in the task description and research idea by integrating dynamic retrieval, sparse attention, and compressive caching. It positions itself clearly relative to the cited literature, aiming to unify concepts like context pruning (AttentionRAG), long-context attention (GCA), and KV cache compression (RazorAttention, PyramidKV) into a single, co-optimized framework."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is logically broken down into its core components (Retriever, Attention, Cache). Key mechanisms like the RL objective, sparse attention formulation, and cache update rule are mathematically defined. The experimental plan is detailed, covering datasets, baselines, metrics, and hyperparameters. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the specific architecture for the policy network or the exact nature of the 'straight-through differentiable relaxation', but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed approach. The structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like sparse attention, RAG, and KV cache compression exist (as shown in the literature review), the core novelty lies in their specific, unified integration and end-to-end co-optimization. Key novel aspects include: 1) Using RL for dynamic, query-specific *token-level* retrieval to guide sparsity, rather than chunk-level retrieval or static patterns. 2) Conditioning the sparse attention mechanism directly on these dynamically retrieved tokens. 3) Employing a learned, rotating compressive KV cache integrated within this framework. 4) Co-optimizing retrieval, attention, and compression via a hybrid loss. This combination represents a fresh approach distinct from prior work focusing on optimizing these aspects in isolation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established machine learning techniques: reinforcement learning (policy gradients for the retriever), sparse attention mechanisms, and low-rank approximations for compression. The mathematical formulations for the RL objective, sparse attention computation, and cache update appear correct and well-justified within the context of the goals. The proposed hybrid loss function for end-to-end training is a sensible approach to balancing accuracy and efficiency costs. Potential challenges, like RL training stability and the effectiveness of the specific compression scheme, are inherent research questions rather than fundamental flaws in the methodology. The overall technical approach is well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training a large foundation model with integrated RL, custom sparse attention, and learned compression components end-to-end is complex and computationally intensive, requiring substantial GPU resources (A100s mentioned) and engineering effort. Debugging and tuning the RL policy within this complex system can be particularly difficult. Data preparation for long-context streaming tasks is non-trivial. However, the plan is well-defined, uses standard tools (FAISS), and proposes relevant baselines. With adequate resources and expertise, the research plan is achievable, though ambitious. The risks are manageable but notable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and timely problem: the quadratic complexity and memory bottleneck limiting the application of foundation models to long contexts and streaming data. Successfully developing DS-RASQ would represent a major advancement in enabling efficient, adaptive AI. The potential impact spans improved real-time analysis, personalized agents, and broader deployment of FMs in resource-constrained settings. The research directly aligns with key challenges in the field and the specific themes of the workshop, promising substantial contributions to scalable and adaptive AI."
