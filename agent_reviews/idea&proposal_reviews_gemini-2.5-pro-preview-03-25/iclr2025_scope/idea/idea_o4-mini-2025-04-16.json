        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea directly addresses several key topics of the workshop, including 'Quadratic to Sub-Quadratic Model Conversion', 'Efficient Long Context Understanding', 'Efficient Sub-Quadratic Foundation Models', and 'Model Optimization for Latency and Throughput Efficient Inference'. It proposes a conversion method using techniques like distillation, mentioned in the call. It aims to improve efficiency (speed, memory) for long contexts, a central theme. While it doesn't explicitly tackle all listed topics like MoE or continual fine-tuning details, its core focus on converting pre-trained transformers to efficient sub-quadratic forms is highly relevant and perfectly aligned with the workshop's main goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (quadratic bottleneck), the core two-stage approach (factorization + distillation), the components (low-rank global, sparse local, dynamic pruning), and the target outcome (sub-quadratic conversion, efficiency gains, minimal accuracy loss) are well-defined. The claimed empirical results provide concrete targets. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the exact algebraic factorization method and the specifics of the dynamic key pruning mechanism, but the overall concept is readily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing concepts like low-rank approximation, sparse attention, and knowledge distillation for model conversion. While these individual components are not new, the specific proposed pipeline – algebraic factorization into low-rank global and sparse local components followed by lightweight distillation targeting both logits and attention maps, applied post-hoc to pre-trained models – offers a notable degree of originality. The addition of dynamic key pruning further enhances the approach. It's innovative in its specific combination and application as a conversion strategy, rather than training from scratch."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed techniques (low-rank factorization, sparse attention implementation, knowledge distillation) are standard and well-understood in the ML community. Implementing these components is practical with current libraries and hardware. The main challenge lies in achieving the desired low accuracy degradation (<1%) simultaneously with significant speed/memory gains, particularly ensuring the initial factorization preserves enough information and the lightweight distillation is effective. Access to pre-trained models and suitable datasets for distillation is required, but generally available. Overall, the idea appears largely feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical bottleneck in transformer models: their quadratic complexity with sequence length. Enabling efficient post-hoc conversion of large pre-trained models to sub-quadratic forms without full retraining would be highly impactful, saving computational resources and broadening applicability. Potential benefits include enabling long-context processing in resource-constrained environments, improving latency for real-time applications, and facilitating adaptation across various domains (language, vision, multimodal) as mentioned. If successful, LoSSA could significantly advance the deployment of efficient foundation models."
