    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly consistent with the workshop's theme of scalable optimization for efficient and adaptive foundation models. It directly addresses several key points mentioned in the task description, including 'Efficient Long Context Understanding', the challenge of 'efficient handling of the KV cache' that grows with longer contexts, 'efficient adaptation', and 'Model Optimization for Latency and Throughput Efficient Inference'. It also implicitly relates to making RAG more efficient by managing the context derived from retrieved documents. The focus on dynamic, context-aware compression aligns perfectly with the need for adaptive efficiency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (KV cache bottleneck in long contexts/adaptation) is well-defined. The core concept of using a 'Contextual Importance Predictor' (CIP) to dynamically prune/compress the KV cache based on task-specific relevance and a budget is understandable. The evaluation plan is mentioned. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific architecture of the CIP, how 'task-specific relevance' is learned/defined, and the exact mechanism for dynamic threshold adjustment, but the overall proposal is clear enough to grasp the main thrust of the research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses notable originality. While KV cache compression itself is not new (static quantization, pruning exist), the proposed approach of using a *learned, dynamic, context-aware* module (CIP) to predict relevance based on the current query and cache state for adaptive compression/pruning offers a fresh perspective. This goes beyond static methods or simpler dynamic heuristics (like FIFO, LRU, or basic attention score thresholding). Training a dedicated module for this prediction task, potentially tailored during fine-tuning, represents a novel combination and refinement of existing concepts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea appears largely feasible. Training a lightweight predictor module (e.g., a small MLP or transformer layer) is standard practice. Integrating it into the inference pipeline to selectively compress/prune KV pairs is technically achievable, although it requires careful engineering. Standard long-context and continual learning benchmarks can be used for evaluation. Potential challenges include ensuring the CIP's overhead doesn't negate the gains, effectively training the CIP to predict relevance accurately without harming downstream task performance, and tuning the dynamic threshold mechanism. However, these seem like engineering and research challenges rather than fundamental roadblocks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying large foundation models: the memory and latency costs associated with the KV cache, especially for long contexts and adaptive scenarios (continual learning, RAG). Successfully developing an effective context-adaptive compression technique could lead to substantial improvements in inference efficiency (memory reduction, potentially faster processing by reducing data movement/computation on less relevant tokens), making long-context models more practical and scalable. This directly contributes to the goals outlined in the workshop description."
