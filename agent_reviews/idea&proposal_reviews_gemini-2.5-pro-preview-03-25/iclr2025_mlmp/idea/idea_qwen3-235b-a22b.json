        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of using AI to tackle multiscale modeling challenges by proposing a method to automate scale transitions (switching between high-fidelity and coarse-grained models). It explicitly mentions using AI (RL, symbolic reasoning) to find efficient approximations starting from computationally expensive simulations, targeting high-impact problems (catalyst design) mentioned in the call. The goal of developing a 'universal AI-driven framework' matches the workshop's aim."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly states the motivation (computational cost), the core components (RL for dynamic model selection, symbolic regression for physical constraints), the objective (speedup with accuracy), and potential applications. The general mechanism is understandable. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise implementation details of how the RL state/action space is defined for model switching and how symbolic regression outputs are integrated to enforce physical laws, but the overall concept is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While RL for adaptive simulations and symbolic regression for discovering physical laws are known techniques, their proposed integration for dynamically selecting physics-based models (e.g., quantum vs. classical) across scales while enforcing physical consistency via symbolic regression is a novel combination for this specific problem. It offers a fresh perspective compared to static multiscale methods or purely data-driven surrogate models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Required components like RL frameworks, symbolic regression tools, and multiscale simulation data exist. However, integrating them effectively, designing a robust RL agent (reward function, state representation) for stable and optimal model switching, ensuring symbolic regression yields useful and integrable physical constraints, and generating sufficient high-quality training data across diverse systems will require considerable effort, expertise, and computational resources. It's ambitious but not impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. It targets a fundamental bottleneck ('grand challenge') in computational science â€“ the prohibitive cost of accurate multiscale simulations. Successfully developing such a framework could lead to major advancements by enabling simulations of previously intractable systems in critical areas like materials science, drug discovery (protein folding), energy (catalysts), and potentially others mentioned in the workshop call (climate, biology). The potential for 10-100x speedups would be transformative."
