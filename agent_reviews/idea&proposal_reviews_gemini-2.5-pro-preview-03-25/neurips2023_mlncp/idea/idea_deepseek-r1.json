        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the need for co-designing ML models (EBMs) with non-traditional hardware (analog stochastic hardware). It explicitly targets a model class (EBMs) mentioned in the task as limited by compute resources. Furthermore, it proposes to exploit inherent hardware characteristics (noise) as a resource, which is a key theme of the task. The goals of achieving efficiency, sustainability, and enabling new model classes are all central to the proposal and the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (EBM sampling cost, analog potential), main idea (co-design, leveraging noise), methodology (characterization, training algorithms, hybrid framework), and expected impact (faster/efficient sampling, EBM adoption) are articulated concisely and logically. There are no major ambiguities. Minor details on the specific mapping mechanisms or hybrid framework implementation could be further elaborated, but the core concept is immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While EBMs, analog computing, and hardware-software co-design exist independently, the specific proposal to co-design EBMs with analog hardware by *leveraging inherent device noise* as the primary mechanism for *stochastic sampling* (replacing traditional MCMC) is highly innovative. Developing training algorithms specifically optimized for these noisy, constrained hardware dynamics represents a fresh perspective compared to merely accelerating existing algorithms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces considerable implementation challenges. Characterizing hardware noise is standard, but developing stable training algorithms that effectively map physical noise to desired sampling dynamics while handling hardware constraints (limited precision, connectivity) is a significant research hurdle. Training EBMs is already difficult, and integrating hardware-specific noise models adds complexity. Access to suitable, well-characterized analog hardware platforms might also be a bottleneck. The proposed hybrid approach acknowledges these difficulties but adds system complexity. Significant research and engineering effort would be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Successfully implementing this could overcome a major computational bottleneck for EBMs, potentially making them practical for large-scale applications and low-power devices. This directly addresses the task's goal of enabling model classes limited by compute. Furthermore, it contributes to the critical need for energy-efficient AI and provides a compelling use case for analog hardware, potentially guiding future hardware design by demonstrating how noise can be a feature, not just a bug. The potential impact on generative AI and sustainable computing is substantial."
