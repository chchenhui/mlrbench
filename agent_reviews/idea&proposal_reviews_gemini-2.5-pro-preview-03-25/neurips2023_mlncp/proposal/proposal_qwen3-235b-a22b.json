    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (ML on new compute paradigms, co-design, exploiting noise, enabling new models), the research idea (physics-informed architectures, stochastic layers, physics loss, surrogates), and the literature review (builds upon cited works on noisy training, physics-informed methods, stochastic layers, EBMs on analog). It directly addresses the core challenges of analog hardware (noise, low precision) and aims to exploit these properties, as requested by the task. It incorporates key concepts from the cited literature and addresses the challenges highlighted therein."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, objectives, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and logically. The mathematical formulations for the stochastic residual layers and the physics-informed loss are presented clearly. The experimental plan is specific regarding datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablations. Minor details, such as the exact parameterization of the learnable noise function H(x, W) or specifics of the surrogate implementation, could be elaborated further, but the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several recent ideas in a novel framework. While individual components like stochastic layers (Black et al.), physics-informed approaches for hardware (White et al.), noisy training (Wang et al., Zhou et al.), and hardware surrogates exist, the specific combination proposed here is innovative. The formulation of the physics-informed loss (combining KL divergence on weights and matching activation statistics) and the specific design of the stochastic residual layer integrated within this framework appear original. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as it builds directly on cited prior work, but it offers a fresh and well-motivated approach to hardware co-design."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical concepts (residual networks, regularization, physics-informed ML, noise modeling). The proposed methodology, including stochastic layers, asymmetric activations, physics-informed loss, and differentiable surrogates, is well-justified based on the properties of analog hardware. The mathematical formulations are generally correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is robust, incorporating relevant baselines, metrics, ablation studies, and validation on both simulators and real hardware (IBM Analog AI Cloud). Minor points like the assumption of Gaussian noise or the need for more detail on the learnable noise function H(x,W) slightly temper the score, but the overall approach is technically sound."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the core concepts (custom layers, loss functions) are implementable in standard ML frameworks, developing accurate and *differentiable* hardware surrogates that capture complex non-idealities (crosstalk, detailed noise models) is non-trivial and resource-intensive. Hardware-in-the-loop training, while ideal for validation, can be complex logistically and slow. Tuning the multi-term loss function with several hyperparameters (\\lambda, \\gamma, \\alpha) will likely require extensive experimentation. Access to and reliable operation of the specified analog hardware platform (IBM Analog AI Cloud) is crucial. The ambitious accuracy targets also contribute to the feasibility risk."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical challenge of enabling robust and efficient machine learning on noisy, low-power analog hardware, which is crucial for the future of sustainable AI and edge computing. Success would represent a major advancement in hardware-algorithm co-design, potentially unlocking the practical use of analog accelerators for complex tasks, including training generative models or EBMs. Achieving high accuracy at very low precision (4-bit) and demonstrating significant energy savings would have substantial practical implications. The goal of transforming noise from a liability into an asset is conceptually important."
