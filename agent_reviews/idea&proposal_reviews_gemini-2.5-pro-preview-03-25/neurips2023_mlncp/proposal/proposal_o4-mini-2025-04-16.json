    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the task's call for co-designing ML models with new compute paradigms (analog hardware), tackling inherent noise and limitations. The methodology precisely implements the research idea's core concepts (physics-informed training, stochastic residual layers, hardware-aware loss, HIL/surrogate models). Furthermore, it effectively situates the work within the provided literature, referencing relevant prior art (noisy training, physics-informed methods, stochastic layers, EBMs on analog) and aiming to overcome the identified key challenges (noise, mismatch, low precision)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, the methodology is broken down into logical steps with clear mathematical formulations for noise models, SRLs, and the loss function. Algorithm 1 provides a concise overview of the training process. The experimental design is detailed and unambiguous. The language is precise and technical. While minor details like the exact calibration procedure or the form of the hardware distribution could be slightly more elaborated, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing research threads in a novel configuration tailored for robust training on analog hardware. While concepts like noisy training, physics-informed regularization, stochastic layers, and hardware-in-the-loop training exist (as evidenced by the literature review), the specific design of the Stochastic Residual Layers (SRLs) with data-dependent noise, the formulation of the physics-informed loss combining weight clipping and KL divergence against empirical hardware distributions, and the proposed HIL algorithm with periodic surrogate model calibration represent a novel synthesis. It's a strong combination and refinement of ideas rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It builds upon established ML principles (residual networks, SGD, regularization, reparameterization trick) and incorporates plausible models for analog hardware non-idealities (noise, quantization). The proposed SRL design and physics-informed loss are well-motivated. The use of hardware calibration to refine surrogate models adds rigor. The experimental plan is comprehensive, including relevant baselines and ablation studies. Potential weaknesses include the simplification inherent in the noise models (e.g., Gaussian assumption) and the reliance on accurate hardware characterization, but the overall approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some practical challenges. Implementation requires expertise in both ML (PyTorch, custom layers) and hardware interfacing. Crucially, it depends on access to specific analog hardware prototypes (memristor arrays, Loihi) and their associated control software/APIs for the hardware-in-the-loop component and calibration. Characterizing hardware accurately and managing potential instability or slow communication in HIL training are key risks. However, the core algorithmic ideas are implementable using existing software frameworks, and HIL experiments are common in this research area, making the project challenging but achievable with the right resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: enabling robust and efficient deep learning on energy-constrained analog hardware. This directly tackles the sustainability and scalability challenges of current AI, as highlighted in the task description. Success would represent a major step towards unlocking the potential of analog accelerators, potentially leading to substantial energy savings (5-10x claimed), enabling complex models (like EBMs) on edge devices, and advancing the co-design paradigm. The potential impact on both large-scale AI and low-power applications is substantial."
