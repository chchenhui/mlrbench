    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task (co-designing ML models for non-traditional hardware), incorporates the central concepts from the research idea (stochastic residual layers, physics-informed loss), and positions itself effectively within the context of the provided literature (citing relevant works, addressing key challenges like noise, low precision, and co-design complexity). The objectives and methodology directly reflect the goal of exploiting, rather than just mitigating, hardware non-idealities, which is central to the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are distinct, the methodology sections are logically structured, and the core concepts (stochastic layers, physics-informed loss) are explained with supporting mathematical formulations. The training procedure and experimental design are outlined comprehensibly. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for learning time-dependent noise parameters or the exact implementation details of surrogate gradients for the noise generator, but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding. The proposal is generally easy to follow and understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing a specific, integrated framework for hardware-algorithm co-design. While individual components like noise-aware training, physics-informed regularization, and stochastic layers exist in the literature (as evidenced by the review), the novelty lies in their specific combination and application: using *adaptive* stochastic residual layers (with learnable coefficients and parameterized noise) coupled with a *physics-informed loss* targeting specific hardware dynamics (bit-depth, activation asymmetry) within a unified training paradigm. This synergistic approach, aiming to actively leverage hardware properties, distinguishes it from prior work focusing primarily on noise tolerance or general co-design principles."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established concepts like residual networks, noise modeling, regularization, and physics-informed machine learning. The proposed methods (stochastic layers, physics-informed loss terms) are theoretically plausible and grounded in relevant prior work. The inclusion of techniques like reparameterization/surrogate gradients for backpropagation through stochastic elements and the plan for hardware-in-the-loop validation or surrogate modeling demonstrate methodological rigor. While the specific effectiveness of the proposed loss terms or the accuracy of noise modeling needs empirical validation, the overall approach is technically well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Access to specific analog hardware (IBM NorthPole, Mythic AMP) or reliable FPGA emulators is crucial and may be a bottleneck. Characterizing hardware noise accurately and developing robust, differentiable surrogate models are non-trivial tasks. Hardware-in-the-loop training introduces considerable engineering complexity. While standard datasets are used, the core technical work requires specialized expertise in both ML and hardware. The project is ambitious, and success depends heavily on overcoming these practical hurdles, making it moderately feasible within a typical research project timeframe without significant resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical and timely problem of AI's energy consumption and computational demands by exploring energy-efficient analog hardware. Successfully co-designing models to be robust and performant on such hardware could lead to major advancements in sustainable AI and enable powerful models (like generative AI or EBMs) on edge devices. The potential 10-20x energy reduction is substantial. Contributing open-source frameworks would also significantly benefit the research community working at the intersection of ML and novel hardware."
