    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses key themes of the workshop, such as leveraging pretrained models from other modalities (BERT, ViT), developing multimodal time series models (MAFFT), and creating new datasets/benchmarks (NewsTime). The methodology precisely implements the core research idea of fusing numerical data with text/vision context using modality-specific encoders, cross-modal attention, and adaptive weighting. It effectively situates itself within the provided literature, citing relevant recent works (Emami et al., Zhong et al., Kim et al., Ding et al.) and aiming to address identified challenges like modality integration and attention design."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, and significance are articulated concisely. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the architecture (encoding, fusion, head), data handling, mathematical formulations (attention, gating, loss), training procedures, and a comprehensive experimental design. The structure is logical and easy to follow, leaving minimal room for ambiguity. Minor details, like the specifics of the temporal transformer or probabilistic head, could be slightly expanded, but the overall clarity is excellent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While multimodal time series forecasting and leveraging pretrained models are existing research directions (as evidenced by the literature review), the specific combination proposed in MAFFT offers novelty. Key innovative aspects include: 1) The simultaneous integration of pretrained text (BERT) and vision (ViT) encoders with a dedicated temporal transformer. 2) The specific design of the pairwise cross-modal attention mechanism followed by aggregation. 3) The adaptive modality weighting mechanism based on concatenated representations to dynamically adjust fusion. 4) The creation of a new multimodal dataset (NewsTime). While not entirely groundbreaking, it presents a fresh and well-motivated combination of techniques distinct from the cited prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (Transformers, attention mechanisms, multimodal learning, transfer learning). The proposed methodology uses established deep learning components, and the mathematical formulations for attention and gating appear correct, though minor clarifications on weight sharing in cross-attention could be beneficial. The experimental design is robust, including relevant baselines, standard metrics for both point and probabilistic forecasting, ablation studies to validate design choices, and plans for interpretability analysis. The approach is well-justified and grounded in the cited literature."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The core architecture uses standard components readily available in libraries like PyTorch and HuggingFace. Using public benchmarks is straightforward. The main challenges are: 1) Creating the custom 'NewsTime' dataset, which requires significant effort in scraping, cleaning, and aligning data, but is a common task in data-centric ML research. 2) Access to sufficient computational resources (GPUs) for training large models (BERT, ViT) and running extensive experiments. Assuming adequate resources and data acquisition capabilities, the research plan is practical and implementable within a typical research project timeframe."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: improving time series forecasting accuracy and robustness by incorporating rich contextual information from other modalities, particularly relevant in the era of large pretrained models. Success would lead to substantial contributions: potentially superior forecasting performance (especially during external shocks), a novel and interpretable fusion architecture (MAFFT), insights into dynamic modality relevance, and a valuable new public benchmark dataset (NewsTime). The potential impact spans critical domains like energy, finance, and healthcare, aligning well with the workshop's focus on real-world applications and advancing the frontier of time series research."
