    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for multimodal time series models leveraging large pre-trained models (PatchTST, BERT, CLIP) and aims to create a new benchmark dataset. It faithfully implements the core research idea of multimodal attention fusion with dynamic weighting. Furthermore, it acknowledges and builds upon the cited literature (Time-VLM, Hybrid-MMF, etc.) while aiming to tackle identified challenges like modality integration and dynamic attention."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. Objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology section provides a detailed overview of the architecture (MAF-Net), data sources and preparation, algorithmic design (including mathematical formulations for key components like cross-modal attention and adaptive fusion), training strategy, baselines, and evaluation plan. The structure is logical, flowing from background and objectives to methods and expected outcomes. There is minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While multimodal time series forecasting and attention mechanisms exist (as shown in the literature review), the specific combination of PatchTST for temporal encoding, cross-modal attention where numerical representations query contextual modalities (text/vision), and an *adaptive* fusion mechanism dynamically weighting modalities based on the temporal signal's characteristics (via LSTM) presents a novel approach. It distinguishes itself from prior work like Time-VLM's retrieval/augmentation or Hybrid-MMF's early fusion. The novelty lies in the specific architecture and the adaptive weighting strategy."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon strong foundations by leveraging state-of-the-art pre-trained models (PatchTST, BERT, CLIP) and standard deep learning components (attention, LSTMs). The cross-modal attention mechanism is a technically sound application of attention principles. The adaptive fusion mechanism, while perhaps less theoretically grounded than standard attention, is a plausible and well-motivated heuristic approach to dynamic weighting. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant metrics (MAE, RMSE, CRPS), strong baselines, and necessary ablation studies. Technical formulations appear correct."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Accessing pre-trained models is straightforward, but training a complex multimodal model like MAF-Net will require significant computational resources (GPUs, memory). A key challenge lies in data acquisition, synchronization, and preparation, particularly for the proposed new 'Energy Demand with Satellite Imagery' dataset, which could be time-consuming and complex. While the core implementation uses standard ML components, integrating and training the full system effectively requires expertise. The plan is realistic, but data collection and computational demands introduce moderate risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical limitation of unimodal time series models by incorporating rich contextual information, which is crucial for accuracy in complex real-world systems, especially during anomalies or regime shifts. Potential improvements in forecasting accuracy (especially probabilistic forecasts measured by CRPS) and robustness to missing data are substantial. The planned release of a curated multimodal benchmark dataset (MultiTime-5M) would be a major contribution to the community. Success would advance multimodal learning theory and provide practical benefits in high-impact domains like energy, healthcare, and finance."
