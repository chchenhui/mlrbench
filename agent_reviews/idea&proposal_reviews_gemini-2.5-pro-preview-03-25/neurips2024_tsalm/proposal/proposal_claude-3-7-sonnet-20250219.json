    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for research on multimodal time series models and leveraging pre-trained models from other modalities. The methodology faithfully implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea, including modality-specific encoders, cross-modal attention, and an adaptive weighting mechanism. Furthermore, it explicitly references the provided literature, positioning itself relative to prior work (Emami et al., Zhong et al., Ding et al., Kim et al.) and aiming to address the identified challenges, such as dynamic modality integration and improving upon previous multimodal forecasting attempts."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The introduction effectively sets the context and motivation. The objectives are explicitly listed. The methodology section details the proposed architecture (encoders, attention, adaptive mechanism, decoder), data handling, training, and evaluation plan. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist in some technical descriptions (e.g., the precise inputs/outputs of the ContextEncoder, the exact nature of the 'conditional computation' mentioned briefly in the introduction but not detailed in the methodology), but these do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the proposed work."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality, primarily through the 'adaptive modality importance mechanism'. While multimodal fusion and cross-modal attention for time series are existing concepts (as evidenced by the literature review), the proposed mechanism's specific design—dynamically adjusting modality influence based on both forecasting context (via Context-Aware Importance Estimator) and data quality (via Data Quality Assessor)—appears to be a novel contribution compared to the cited works. The hierarchical attention structure is a reasonable design choice but less novel in itself. The proposal clearly distinguishes its approach from prior work like Emami et al. (static/feature-level focus) and Time-VLM (VLM focus)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established techniques like TCNs, Transformers, pre-trained encoders (BERT, ViT), and attention mechanisms. The overall architectural design is logical. The core idea of adaptive weighting based on context and quality is conceptually sound. The multi-task loss function is appropriate. The experimental design is comprehensive and rigorous, including comparisons against relevant baselines, ablation studies, robustness checks, multiple evaluation metrics (point, probabilistic, anomaly, efficiency), statistical significance testing, and interpretability analysis. Minor weaknesses include the need for more specific details on the implementation of the adaptive mechanism (e.g., architecture of ContextEncoder, specific quality metrics)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. The primary concerns are data acquisition and computational resources. Collecting and temporally aligning high-quality multimodal data (time series, text, images, categorical) across three diverse domains (finance, energy, healthcare) is a significant undertaking. Training the proposed complex architecture, which involves multiple large pre-trained encoders and attention mechanisms, will require substantial computational power (GPU time and memory). While using pre-trained models helps, end-to-end training and extensive hyperparameter tuning (e.g., via Bayesian optimization as proposed) across three datasets remain demanding. The plan is ambitious for typical research constraints."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: improving time series forecasting by leveraging rich contextual information from multiple modalities, especially during critical events like anomalies or regime changes. Success in this area has substantial potential impact across important domains like finance, energy, and healthcare, leading to more robust decision-making. The research aims to make significant theoretical contributions (advancing multimodal fusion understanding, novel adaptive mechanisms) and methodological contributions (flexible architecture). It aligns perfectly with the growing interest in multimodal learning and foundation models within the time series community, as highlighted by the workshop theme."
