    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for 'Multimodal Time Series Models' that integrate exogenous information using large models. The objectives and methodology perfectly reflect the research idea of using multimodal attention fusion with pre-trained encoders. It acknowledges and builds upon the cited literature, positioning itself within the current research landscape and addressing identified challenges like modality integration and attention design."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, overall architecture, methodology (data, training, evaluation), and expected outcomes are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. However, the specific details of the 'cross-modal attention module' and the 'adaptive weighting mechanism' remain somewhat high-level. The mathematical formulations provided are placeholders rather than precise definitions. Further clarification on the exact implementation of these core components and the interpretability methods would enhance clarity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates satisfactory novelty. While multimodal time series forecasting using attention and pre-trained models is an active area of research (as evidenced by the literature review), the proposal combines these elements with a specific focus on enhancing robustness during anomalous periods and includes an 'adaptive weighting mechanism' based on data quality/relevance. The novelty lies more in the specific architectural configuration, the adaptive weighting concept, and the systematic comparison of attention mechanisms within this context, rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking paradigm. It builds upon and integrates existing ideas effectively."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and methodologically rigorous. It builds on solid foundations (Transformers, attention, multimodal learning) and proposes a logical architecture. The use of pre-trained encoders, standard evaluation metrics, and a structured experimental design (including ablation studies) is appropriate. However, the lack of specific detail in the mathematical formulations for the core attention and weighting mechanisms slightly weakens the rigor. The concept of 'adaptive weighting' based on 'data quality and relevance' needs a more concrete definition of how these factors will be quantified and integrated. The plan for synthetic data generation also lacks specifics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but faces challenges. The required techniques (CNNs, Transformers, attention) are established, and leveraging pre-trained models is standard. However, acquiring or creating high-quality, large-scale, time-aligned multimodal datasets across diverse domains (finance, healthcare, energy) is a significant hurdle, as acknowledged in the literature review. Training these potentially large models will require substantial computational resources. While technically achievable with the right expertise and resources, data availability poses a moderate risk to successful implementation."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in time series forecasting: the limitation of relying solely on numerical data and the need for robustness during anomalies or regime changes. By aiming to integrate multimodal contextual information using advanced techniques, the research has strong potential to lead to more accurate and reliable forecasting models. Success would represent a meaningful contribution to the field, with practical implications for domains like finance, healthcare, and energy. It aligns well with the important trend of using large models and multimodality in time series analysis."
