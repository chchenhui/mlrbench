        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop's scope. It directly addresses two key topics: 'Leveraging Pretrained Models of Other Modalities for Time Series' by proposing the use of an LLM for text encoding, and 'Multimodal Time Series Models' by focusing on the fusion of numerical time series data with textual event data. Furthermore, it implicitly touches upon 'Building Time Series Foundation Models' (by mentioning transformer-based models) and 'Real-World Applications' (finance, energy). The motivation and proposed approach fit squarely within the theme of 'Time Series in the Age of Large Models'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-articulated. The motivation is compelling, and the main components of the proposed framework (numerical model, event detection, LLM encoder, dynamic fusion mechanism) are explicitly mentioned. The goal of improving forecasts for event-driven shifts is unambiguous. While specific architectural details or the exact nature of the dynamic fusion trigger are not fully elaborated, this level of detail is appropriate for a research idea summary. The core concept is easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea possesses satisfactory novelty. While multimodal time series forecasting integrating text is an existing research area, and using LLMs for text representation is becoming increasingly common, the proposed 'dynamic fusion' mechanism triggered by anomalies or uncertainty in the numerical forecast offers a novel twist. Most existing approaches might use static fusion or simpler attention mechanisms. The specific combination of event detection, LLM encoding, and adaptive, uncertainty-aware fusion provides a degree of originality, though it builds significantly on established concepts rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents notable implementation challenges. The core components (transformer-based TS models, LLMs, attention/gating mechanisms) are available. However, acquiring and accurately aligning high-quality, timestamped numerical time series data with relevant asynchronous textual event data at scale can be difficult. Implementing and training the dynamic fusion mechanism, particularly the part that reliably detects anomalies or high uncertainty to trigger text integration, requires careful design and experimentation. Significant computational resources would also be needed for training the large models involved. Therefore, while conceptually sound, practical implementation faces considerable hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea has good significance. It addresses a well-known and important limitation of traditional time series models â€“ their difficulty in reacting to sudden, externally driven events. Improving forecast accuracy during such events is critical in high-stakes domains like finance, energy, and supply chain management. Successfully implementing this idea could lead to more robust and reliable forecasting systems. It also contributes to the broader understanding of how to effectively combine different data modalities and leverage large language models for time series analysis, which is a timely research direction."
