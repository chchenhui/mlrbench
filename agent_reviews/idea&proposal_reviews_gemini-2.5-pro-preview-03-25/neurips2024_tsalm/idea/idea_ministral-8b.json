        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on the 'Analysis of Pretrained Time Series Models', highlighting their black-box nature as a key challenge. This idea directly addresses that challenge by proposing a framework to enhance the interpretability of these specific models, fitting squarely within the workshop's scope."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (interpretability gap), the proposed approach (hybrid framework using specific XAI techniques like attention, feature importance, counterfactuals), and the expected outcomes (interpretability framework, better understanding, enhanced trust). The language is concise and unambiguous, making the proposal easy to understand."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While applying XAI techniques is not new in general machine learning, focusing specifically on interpreting the internal representations of *pretrained time series foundation models* is a relatively recent and less explored area. Developing a dedicated framework that integrates multiple XAI methods tailored for these large-scale time series models offers a fresh perspective and addresses a timely challenge highlighted by the rise of such models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The proposed XAI techniques (attention analysis, feature importance, counterfactual explanations) are established methods. Pretrained time series models are becoming increasingly available. Implementation would require expertise in both time series modeling and XAI, and potentially significant computational resources depending on the scale of the models analyzed, but it relies on existing methodologies and technologies, making it practical to implement within a research context."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Interpretability is a major barrier to the adoption of complex models, especially in critical domains often involving time series data (e.g., healthcare, finance, energy). Enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of powerful pretrained time series models directly addresses this critical bottleneck, potentially leading to wider acceptance, safer deployment, and major advancements in the practical application of these models."
