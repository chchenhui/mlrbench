        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the second major theme of the AI4Mat workshop: 'What are Next-Generation Representations of Materials Data?'. The idea focuses explicitly on integrating multiple data modalities (structural, electronic, synthesis) into a unified representation to handle complexity and diversity, which is a core challenge highlighted in the theme description. It also touches upon the first theme by suggesting this unified representation could serve as a foundation for future materials-specific AI models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly states the motivation (limitations of current representations, need for unification), the core technical approach (multi-modal contrastive learning, modality-specific encoders, shared embedding space), methods to address challenges (physics-informed regularization, data augmentation for scarcity), and expected outcomes (improved cross-modal retrieval, property prediction). The concepts are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While contrastive learning and multi-modal learning are established concepts in broader ML, their specific application to unify *heterogeneous* materials data (combining structural graphs, spectroscopic data, and text-based synthesis protocols) within a single framework is innovative. Integrating physics-informed regularization directly into this multi-modal contrastive setup for materials science adds a further layer of novelty relevant to the field. It offers a fresh perspective compared to single-modality materials representations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Contrastive learning frameworks, GNNs, and Transformers are well-developed. However, challenges exist. Curating and aligning diverse multi-modal materials datasets can be complex and labor-intensive. Training such models may require significant computational resources. The effectiveness of physics-informed regularization and data augmentation in this specific context needs empirical validation. While implementable, it requires careful data engineering and potentially substantial compute."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Creating unified representations that bridge diverse materials data modalities addresses a critical bottleneck in AI for materials science. Success could lead to more robust and generalizable models, significantly accelerating materials discovery and property prediction. It directly tackles the challenge of leveraging complex, real-world materials data and could pave the way for more powerful foundation models in the domain, aligning with major research directions."
