    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the AI4Mat workshop themes of 'Next-Generation Representations of Materials Data' and 'Foundation Models for Materials Science'. The core idea of using contrastive learning for multi-modal alignment (structure, text, image) is consistently maintained throughout the proposal, from introduction to methodology and expected outcomes. The proposal explicitly references the provided literature (e.g., GNNs [1-4], CLIP [5], AI impact [6, 7]) and positions itself to address key challenges identified in the review (multi-modal integration, contrastive learning optimization, interpretability [Lit review challenges 1, 2, 5]). The objectives and methodology directly reflect the research idea and the need for unified representations highlighted in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear, well-structured, and easy to follow. The background, problem statement, objectives, and methodology are articulated precisely with minimal ambiguity. Key concepts like Contrastive Multi-Modal Alignment (CMMA), modality-specific encoders, and the contrastive loss function are clearly defined, including relevant mathematical formulations. The experimental design and validation plan are detailed and logical. The language is professional and technically accurate, making the proposal readily understandable to experts in the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the individual components (GNNs, Transformers, CNNs/ViTs, contrastive learning based on CLIP [5]) are established techniques, the novelty lies in their specific combination and application to create unified representations from the particular triad of material modalities: atomic structure, synthesis text, and characterization images. This specific multi-modal alignment task using contrastive learning tailored for materials science is not a standard approach and addresses a recognized gap (multi-modal integration [Lit review challenge 1]). It offers a fresh perspective compared to unimodal approaches [1-4] or simple fusion techniques. The novelty is clearly articulated, though it builds upon existing concepts rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in deep learning, representation learning, and established architectures for each modality (GNNs [1-4], Transformers, CNNs/ViTs). The choice of a contrastive learning framework (inspired by CLIP [5]) for modality alignment is well-justified and technically appropriate. The methodology is detailed, including specific model types, loss function formulation, and a comprehensive experimental plan with relevant baselines, ablation studies, and interpretability analysis [Lit review challenge 5]. The technical formulations presented are correct and clearly explained. The approach directly addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review [1, 2, 5]."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but faces a significant challenge regarding data availability. While the proposed methods (GNNs, Transformers, CNNs, contrastive learning) are technically implementable with current technology and expertise, the success heavily relies on curating large-scale, high-quality datasets where structure, synthesis text, and characterization images are *paired* for the same material instances. The proposal acknowledges this ('scarcer but growing') and mentions leveraging public databases and literature mining, but assembling such a comprehensive dataset remains a non-trivial task and represents the main risk. Assuming adequate data can be obtained and sufficient computational resources are available, the implementation is practical. The plan to handle missing modalities adds to its feasibility."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery: the effective integration of multi-modal data [Lit review challenge 1]. Success would lead to more accurate predictive models, a more holistic understanding of material relationships (structure-synthesis-characterization), and enable novel cross-modal applications. Crucially, it directly contributes to the development of next-generation material representations and foundational models for materials science, aligning perfectly with the AI4Mat workshop themes and the broader goals of the field [6, 7]. The potential for accelerating materials discovery and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration is substantial."
