    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses both key themes of the AI4Mat-ICLR-2025 workshop: building foundation models for materials science and developing next-generation representations, specifically through multi-modal integration. The methodology clearly implements the core research idea of using contrastive learning to align graph, text, and image modalities. It incorporates techniques (GNNs, Transformers, contrastive learning) and addresses challenges (multi-modal integration, interpretability) highlighted in the literature review. The objectives and expected impact are perfectly in sync with the workshop's goals and the initial research concept."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to detailed methodology, evaluation plans, and expected impact. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides precise details on data sources, preprocessing, encoder architectures (including mathematical formulations for key components like GNN updates and attention), the contrastive loss function, algorithmic steps, and evaluation procedures. The rationale is well-articulated, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good originality and innovation. While individual components (GNNs, Transformers, CNNs, contrastive learning like InfoNCE/CLIP) are established, their specific combination and application to create unified representations from *three* distinct modalities (atomic structure graphs, synthesis text, characterization images) in materials science is novel. Most prior work in materials informatics focuses on single or dual modalities. Framing this as a step towards a materials foundation model aligns with current research trends and adds to its novelty. It clearly distinguishes itself from the cited literature which focuses primarily on GNNs or general AI applications like CLIP."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations using well-established and appropriate methods for each data modality (GNNs for structures, Transformers for text, CNNs for images) and for multi-modal alignment (contrastive learning via InfoNCE). The methodology is detailed, technically correct (based on the provided formulations), and includes robust evaluation plans with relevant metrics, ablation studies, and hyperparameter tuning. The approach is well-justified by prior successes in multi-modal learning and the specific needs of materials science."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible, but data acquisition presents a moderate challenge. While the individual data sources (Materials Project, OQMD, literature scraping, image databases) exist, creating a large-scale dataset with accurately aligned *triplets* (structure + synthesis text + characterization image for the *same* material sample) is non-trivial and potentially a bottleneck. The proposal acknowledges the need for 'complete triplets' but doesn't detail the expected size or mitigation strategies if such aligned data is scarce. The computational methods are standard and implementable, and the timeline appears reasonable, but success hinges significantly on overcoming the data alignment hurdle."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical challenge in materials informatics: integrating diverse data types for holistic material understanding. Success would represent a major advancement in materials representation learning, directly contributing to the workshop's themes. The unified embeddings have the potential to significantly improve downstream tasks like property prediction and synthesis recommendation, thereby accelerating the materials discovery pipeline. The goal of creating a foundational component for materials AI and releasing models/code further enhances its potential impact on the research community."
