    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the AI4Mat workshop's themes of 'Foundation Models for Materials Science' and 'Next-Generation Representations of Materials Data' by proposing a unified multi-modal representation. The methodology closely follows the research idea, employing contrastive learning to align structural (GNN), textual (Transformer), and visual (ViT) data. It effectively incorporates and cites relevant works from the literature review (GNNs, CLIP, GNoME context) and acknowledges key challenges identified therein, such as multi-modal integration and GNN scalability. The objectives and significance are explicitly linked back to the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, flowing from introduction and objectives to methodology and expected outcomes. The core concepts (multi-modal data, contrastive alignment, specific encoders) are explained well. The methodology section details the architecture, contrastive loss, data sources, training protocol, and experimental design comprehensibly. Minor areas could benefit from refinement, such as providing more specific details on the hierarchical Transformer architecture or the exact implementation of the negative sampling strategy in the contrastive loss. However, the overall research plan is understandable and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by applying contrastive learning to simultaneously align three distinct modalities (atomic structure, synthesis text, characterization images) within the materials science domain. While the individual components (GNNs, Transformers, ViTs, contrastive learning like CLIP) are established, their specific combination and application to create unified representations for this particular set of material data types is novel. It extends existing multi-modal paradigms (like text-image alignment in CLIP) to the unique challenges of materials data. The novelty lies in the specific integration strategy and the target application, rather than inventing fundamentally new algorithms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations using well-established methods for each modality (3D GNNs for structure, Transformers for text, ViTs for images) and a proven technique (contrastive learning) for alignment. The choice of encoders is appropriate for the data types. The proposed contrastive loss function is plausible for enforcing cross-modal similarity. The experimental design includes relevant baselines, diverse downstream tasks, appropriate metrics, and ablation studies, indicating methodological rigor. The proposal acknowledges limitations like GNN scalability and missing modalities, demonstrating technical awareness. The technical formulations presented are generally correct and suitable for the task."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges, primarily concerning data. While the individual modeling techniques (GNNs, Transformers, ViTs, contrastive learning) are implementable with standard tools and the specified compute resources (A100 GPUs) are appropriate, the core requirement is a large-scale dataset with aligned triplets of structure, synthesis text, and characterization images. Curating and aligning such data from disparate sources (Materials Project, MatBERT, NIST-EM, etc.) is a major undertaking and potential bottleneck, the difficulty of which may be underestimated in the proposal. While specific datasets are mentioned, the process and scale of achieving the necessary alignment for effective contrastive learning across all three modalities are not fully detailed, introducing uncertainty."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical challenge in materials informatics: the integration of diverse data modalities for holistic material understanding, directly aligning with the AI4Mat workshop's key themes. Developing unified representations could lead to major advancements in predicting material properties, understanding synthesis-structure relationships, and accelerating the discovery of new materials with desired functionalities (e.g., for energy, sustainability). The potential to create foundational, multi-modal embeddings for the materials community and release open-source models adds substantial value. Success would represent a major step towards AI-driven materials discovery."
