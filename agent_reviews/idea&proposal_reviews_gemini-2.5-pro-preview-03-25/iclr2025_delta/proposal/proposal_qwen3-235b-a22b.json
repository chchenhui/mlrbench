        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes, including latent space geometry, manifold learning, expressivity, robustness, and AI4Science applications. The methodology builds logically on the research idea (using TDA for latent space regularization) and incorporates concepts and challenges highlighted in the literature review (persistent homology, Wasserstein distance, computational cost, comparison to recent works like TopoDiffusionNet, GAGA, TopoLa). The objectives, methods, and expected outcomes are all coherent with the initial motivation and the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The structure is logical, flowing from introduction and objectives to methodology, expected outcomes, and challenges. Key concepts like persistent homology and the proposed regularization term are explained, although the explanation assumes some familiarity with TDA. The experimental design is detailed with specific datasets, baselines, and metrics. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for adding the topological loss in diffusion models ('added to the denoising loss at intermediate timesteps' could be more specific) and the exact definition/implementation of custom metrics like HCM and GCS. Overall, the proposal is well-defined and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the idea of combining TDA and DGMs exists in recent literature (e.g., TopoDiffusionNet, Topology-Aware Latent Diffusion), this proposal frames it as a general latent space regularization technique applicable across different DGM architectures (VAE, diffusion) using Wasserstein distance on persistence diagrams. It focuses specifically on improving fundamental DGM properties like interpolation, OOD generation, and robustness through topological alignment, rather than solely controlled generation or specific data types. The proposed theoretical analysis (generalization bound extension) also adds to the novelty. It represents a distinct and valuable extension of existing ideas rather than being entirely groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established mathematical concepts (TDA, persistent homology, Wasserstein distance) and standard DGM frameworks. The proposed methodology of using topological distance as a regularizer is theoretically plausible. The experimental design includes relevant baselines, appropriate metrics (including topology-specific ones), and necessary ablation studies. Minor weaknesses include the lack of explicit discussion on the differentiability of the Wasserstein topological loss for backpropagation (though solutions exist) and the potential impact of mini-batch approximations on capturing global topology. The theoretical claim about generalization bounds is stated but not yet proven within the proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant computational challenges. Calculating persistent homology, especially for large datasets and high dimensions, is computationally intensive. The proposal acknowledges this and suggests standard mitigation strategies (subsampling, approximate TDA, mini-batch computations), which are reasonable but need careful implementation and validation. Implementing the differentiable topological loss requires specific expertise and libraries. Access to datasets and standard DGM training resources is assumed feasible. Hyperparameter tuning is acknowledged as complex. Overall, the project is achievable with sufficient computational resources and expertise in both DGMs and TDA, but the computational aspect poses a moderate risk."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and recognized limitation in DGMs: the lack of topological awareness in latent spaces, which hinders performance in tasks requiring structural fidelity. Successfully aligning latent geometry with data topology could lead to major improvements in interpolation quality, OOD generalization, and model robustness. The potential impact is substantial, particularly for AI4Science applications (e.g., molecular design, cosmology, biomedical imaging) where topological correctness is often crucial. It also has implications for computer vision and model interpretability, aligning well with important research directions."
