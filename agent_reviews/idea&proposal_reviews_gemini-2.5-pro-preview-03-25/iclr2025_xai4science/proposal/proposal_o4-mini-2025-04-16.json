    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (XAI for scientific discovery in healthcare, focusing on self-explainable models), the research idea (knowledge-guided self-explainable GNNs integrating ontologies), and the literature review (addressing challenges like performance vs. interpretability, knowledge integration, and validation). It explicitly references the workshop's theme, uses appropriate terminology, and positions itself clearly within the context of prior work and identified challenges. The objectives and methodology directly address the core concepts outlined in the idea and task description."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives, methodology (data, architecture, loss functions, evaluation) are presented logically and in detail. Mathematical formulations for the GNN, attention, and loss components are provided. The overall structure is easy to follow. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise nature of the interpretable function `g_m` in the concept bottleneck layer or the exact source and reliability of edge weights `r_ij` for the knowledge consistency loss, but these do not significantly hinder understanding of the core proposal."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing concepts like GNNs, attention mechanisms, concept bottleneck models, and knowledge integration in ML (as seen in the literature review, e.g., Ma & Zhang, 2019), the specific combination is innovative. Key novel aspects include: 1) Integrating heterogeneous biomedical ontologies directly into a GNN architecture with explicit concept bottleneck layers mapped to biological entities (genes, pathways, drugs). 2) The additive explanation layer built upon these concept scores. 3) The specific joint loss function incorporating prediction, knowledge consistency, sparsity, and concept purity. 4) The strong emphasis on wet-lab validation for discovered insights. It offers a fresh synthesis distinct from the cited prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established ML techniques (GNNs, attention, additive models) and leverages standard biomedical data sources and ontologies. The proposed methodology, including graph construction, model architecture, and loss functions, is technically well-described and appears robust. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. Minor points requiring further justification include the assumption of reliable prior knowledge weights (`r_ij`) for the knowledge consistency loss and the specific formulation of the concept purity loss. Overall, the technical approach is well-founded."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The computational aspects of the proposal (data acquisition from public sources, model implementation using PyTorch Geometric, training on GPUs) are largely feasible, although computationally intensive. However, the proposed wet-lab validation introduces significant feasibility challenges. It depends heavily on securing collaboration, funding, time, and specialized resources, which are not detailed in the proposal. This component carries substantial risk and uncertainty regarding its successful execution within a reasonable timeframe, lowering the overall feasibility score despite the computational parts being achievable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical need for trustworthy and interpretable AI in biomedical research and healthcare, directly aligning with the XAI4Science theme. By aiming to create models that are both predictive and mechanistically interpretable, it has the potential to accelerate biological discovery (biomarkers, drug targets), improve clinical decision-making, and foster trust in AI. The inclusion of wet-lab validation, if successful, would substantially increase the impact by providing experimental evidence for model-derived hypotheses. The proposed framework could also serve as a blueprint for other scientific domains."
