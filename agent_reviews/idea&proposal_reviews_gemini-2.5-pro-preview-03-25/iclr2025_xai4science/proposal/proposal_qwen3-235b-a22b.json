    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of using a-priori XAI for scientific knowledge discovery in healthcare. It faithfully implements the core research idea of knowledge-guided self-explainable models using GNNs and additive models integrated with biomedical ontologies. Furthermore, it explicitly builds upon the cited literature (interpretable GNNs, knowledge integration) and aims to tackle the key challenges identified (balancing performance/interpretability, knowledge integration, validation, trust)."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, outlining the background, objectives, methodology, and expected impact concisely. The model architecture, training protocol, and experimental design are described with sufficient detail, including specific techniques (GAT, GAM), datasets, baselines, and metrics. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise implementation of the GAM shape functions or the exact mechanism for Jaccard index maximization in the loss, but overall the proposal is well-articulated and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While it builds upon existing concepts like GNNs, attention, additive models, and knowledge integration (as cited in the literature review), the specific synthesis is innovative. The combination of ontology-driven GNN message passing, a hierarchical pathway attention module specifically designed for biological pathways, and decomposition via additive models for hierarchical interpretability in biomedical discovery represents a fresh approach. It clearly distinguishes itself from the cited works by integrating these components in a novel architecture tailored for mechanistic insight discovery."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in established ML techniques (GNNs, GAT, GAMs) and leverages standard biomedical data resources. The proposed methodology, including the knowledge-integrated GNN, hierarchical attention, additive decomposition, and the multi-task loss function, is technically plausible and well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, featuring relevant tasks, metrics, baselines, and ablation studies. Technical formulations appear correct, though minor details could be further specified. The approach directly addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review, indicating a solid understanding of the field."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. The use of public datasets and standard ontologies is practical. The core ML techniques (GNNs, GAMs) are implementable with existing libraries, although the specific integration and optimization will require significant expertise and computational resources. The main challenge lies in Objective 3 (wet-lab/clinical validation), which depends heavily on external collaboration and resources beyond the typical scope of an ML project. However, the primary computational research (Objectives 1, 2, 4) is achievable. The scope is ambitious but manageable for a dedicated research effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical need for trustworthy and interpretable AI in healthcare, directly contributing to the goal of using XAI for scientific discovery. By aiming to generate mechanistic insights (e.g., pathways, biomarkers) rather than just predictions, it has the potential to accelerate biomedical research, improve clinical trust, and enable precision medicine. Successful execution could lead to substantial advancements in both XAI methodology and oncology research, making a strong contribution to the field."
