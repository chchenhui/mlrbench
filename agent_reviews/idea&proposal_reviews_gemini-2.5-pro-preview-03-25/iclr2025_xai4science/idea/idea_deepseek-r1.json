        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of using XAI for scientific knowledge discovery. Specifically, it proposes using post-hoc attribution methods (a listed topic) to discover new biomarkers in healthcare (a listed application area), bridging the gap between understanding model behavior and advancing scientific knowledge."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It clearly outlines the motivation (black-box problem in medical AI), the proposed method (using post-hoc attribution, clinician analysis, validation), the specific techniques mentioned (Grad-CAM, SHAP), and the expected outcomes (trust, biomarker discovery, protocol). The process involving iterative feedback is also clearly stated, leaving little room for ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea has notable originality. While applying post-hoc attribution methods like Grad-CAM or SHAP to medical images is common for explaining model predictions, the novelty lies in the proposed systematic framework for explicitly using these explanations as a starting point for *discovering new, previously unrecognized biomarkers*. The emphasis on rigorous clinical validation (retrospective/prospective studies) and the iterative loop between ML experts and clinicians to convert attributions into testable hypotheses offers a fresh perspective on leveraging XAI for scientific discovery, beyond simple explanation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. The core ML techniques (post-hoc attribution methods) are well-established and readily implementable. Access to medical imaging data and trained models is common in research settings. The main requirements are strong interdisciplinary collaboration with clinicians and access to patient outcome data for validation. While prospective studies require significant resources, the initial phases involving retrospective analysis and heatmap review are highly practical. The overall approach uses existing tools and methodologies in a structured way."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the 'black box' nature of AI in healthcare is crucial for building trust and facilitating clinical adoption. Furthermore, the potential to uncover novel biomarkers using AI-driven insights could lead to major advancements in disease understanding, diagnosis, and treatment. Developing a robust protocol for translating model internals into scientific hypotheses would be a valuable contribution to the field of ML4Science, accelerating discovery."
