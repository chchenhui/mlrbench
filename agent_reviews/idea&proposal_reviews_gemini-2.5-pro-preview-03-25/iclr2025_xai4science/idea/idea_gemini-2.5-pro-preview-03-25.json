        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'XAI4Science' by proposing the use of an interpretable model (CBM, an ante-hoc method) combined with post-hoc XAI techniques (SHAP/IG) specifically for knowledge discovery ('discovering new scientific knowledge') within one of the target application areas ('Weather and climate science'). It focuses on moving beyond model understanding to actual scientific discovery, which is the core goal outlined in the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main approach (using CBMs), the specific application (climate teleconnections like ENSO), and the mechanism for discovery (analyzing predefined concepts and using XAI on residuals/novel concepts) are well-defined. A minor ambiguity exists in how exactly the 'residual or combined concepts beyond the predefined ones' are learned or represented within the CBM framework, which typically relies on predefined concepts, but the overall intent is understandable. Minor refinement on this specific point would enhance clarity further."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While Concept Bottleneck Models and post-hoc XAI methods are existing techniques, their combined application specifically for discovering *new* physical mechanisms (teleconnections/precursors) in climate science by analyzing both predefined and potentially emergent/residual concepts is innovative. Applying CBMs to climate data is not entirely new, but framing it explicitly as a tool for discovering novel scientific insights beyond just interpreting known factors offers a fresh perspective compared to standard black-box model interpretation or purely prediction-focused CBM applications."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Climate science has well-defined physical variables that can serve as predefined concepts for the CBM bottleneck. Datasets for training (e.g., climate reanalysis data for inputs, concept values, and teleconnection indices like ENSO state) are generally available. Implementing CBMs and applying post-hoc XAI tools are achievable with current ML libraries. Challenges include selecting the most appropriate concepts, ensuring the model learns meaningful representations, potentially high computational costs for large climate datasets, and rigorously validating whether identified 'novel' patterns are truly new and physically meaningful, which requires significant domain expertise and careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. Discovering novel climate teleconnections or precursor patterns would represent a major advancement in climate science, potentially improving long-range weather forecasting and climate change projections. Addressing the 'black-box' problem in climate modeling with interpretable methods that facilitate scientific discovery is a critical need. Success in this research could demonstrate a powerful pathway for using ML not just for prediction but as a genuine tool for scientific exploration and hypothesis generation in a field with high societal relevance."
