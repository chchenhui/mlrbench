        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It proposes an 'ante-hoc interpretable architecture' (SRINs), directly addressing a key topic ('A-priori (i.e., ante-hoc) interpretability and self-explainable models'). It focuses specifically on 'Weather and climate science', one of the target application areas. Furthermore, its goal of enabling scientists to 'discover new relationships and mechanisms' directly aligns with the workshop's aim of 'using [interpretability] to discover new human knowledge'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation is well-explained, and the core concept of SRINs integrating interpretation via physics-based self-regularization is understandable. The mention of modular components, dual optimization, and attention-based visualization provides a good overview. However, specific details about the exact form of the self-regularization terms, the nature of the modular components, or the precise mechanism for attention-based visualization are not fully elaborated, leaving some minor ambiguities typical of an initial research idea."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While ante-hoc interpretability, physics-informed ML, and modular architectures exist independently, their proposed integration within a 'Self-Regularized Interpretation Network' framework specifically for climate science knowledge discovery is innovative. The core novelty lies in using physics-based constraints not just for prediction accuracy (like PINNs) but explicitly as *self-regularization terms to enforce interpretation quality and scientific consistency* within an ante-hoc interpretable model. This dual focus on accuracy and interpretable, physically consistent reasoning is a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current ML techniques but presents moderate challenges. Implementing deep learning models with custom regularization terms and attention mechanisms is standard. However, formulating effective, differentiable physics-based regularizers requires significant domain expertise in climate science. Designing appropriate modular components representing complex climate processes is non-trivial. Access to suitable climate data and computational resources for training complex models would be necessary. Balancing the multiple objectives (prediction accuracy, interpretation quality, physical consistency) during optimization might require careful tuning. Collaboration between ML experts and climate scientists is crucial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the black-box nature of climate models is crucial for building trust and accelerating scientific understanding of climate change, a critical global challenge. By aiming to provide interpretations grounded in physical consistency, SRINs could lead to more reliable insights and potentially enable the discovery of novel climate dynamics directly from data-driven models. This directly contributes to the workshop's goal of advancing scientific knowledge through XAI and has the potential for major advancements within climate science."
