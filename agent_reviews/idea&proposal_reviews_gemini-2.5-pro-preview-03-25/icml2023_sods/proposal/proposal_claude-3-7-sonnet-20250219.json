        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the task description: efficient sampling/optimization in discrete spaces for black-box objectives with complex correlations, mentioning GFlowNets as a relevant but potentially limited approach. The proposal meticulously follows the research idea by proposing the specific GNN surrogate-driven GFlowNet framework with active learning. It effectively positions itself within the context of the provided literature review (focused on GFlowNets), acknowledging their strengths while proposing a method to overcome the identified limitation of sample efficiency in black-box settings. The methodology explicitly tackles challenges like surrogate accuracy and active learning strategy, which were noted in the literature review summary."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The introduction clearly sets the context and motivation. The methodology section systematically breaks down the proposed approach into its core components (GNN surrogate, GFlowNet, Iterative Framework, Active Learning, Calibration) with clear explanations and relevant mathematical formulations. The objectives are unambiguous, and the experimental design is well-articulated. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making the entire proposal immediately understandable. Minor implementation details (e.g., specific GNN architectures) are omitted, but this is typical for a proposal and does not detract from the overall clarity of the concept and methodology."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While the individual components (GFlowNets, GNNs, surrogate modeling, active learning) exist, their specific combination into an iterative framework where a GNN acts as a *structured* surrogate to guide a GFlowNet via active learning for *black-box* discrete sampling/optimization appears novel. The literature review focuses on GFlowNet advancements but does not mention this specific surrogate-assisted approach. Using a GNN tailored to the discrete object structure (graphs/sequences) as the surrogate within this loop, coupled with specific active learning and calibration strategies, distinguishes it from standard GFlowNets or typical Bayesian Optimization using simpler surrogates. The novelty lies in the synergistic integration of these techniques to enhance sample efficiency for this challenging problem class."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations: GFlowNets for generative sampling, GNNs for graph data representation, and active learning/surrogate modeling for optimization. The proposed methodology is logically coherent, outlining a clear iterative process. The mathematical formulations for the core components are standard and correctly presented. The inclusion of uncertainty estimation (UCB/BALD) for active learning and a calibration step demonstrates methodological rigor and awareness of potential pitfalls like surrogate bias. While practical convergence guarantees are difficult, the overall approach is well-justified and technically sound. Minor gaps exist concerning specific architectural choices or detailed analysis of the feedback loop dynamics, but the core framework is robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing machine learning technology and libraries. GFlowNets, GNNs, and active learning are implementable components. However, integrating them into a stable and efficient iterative framework presents moderate engineering challenges. The success heavily depends on the GNN surrogate's ability to learn a useful approximation quickly and the effectiveness of the active learning strategy. Significant computational resources will be required for repeated training/fine-tuning of the GNN and GFlowNet. Hyperparameter tuning for the multiple components (GNN architecture, GFlowNet parameters, active learning balance, temperature) will likely be complex and time-consuming. While achievable, these factors introduce moderate risks and implementation hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: efficient exploration and optimization in complex, discrete, black-box spaces. This is a fundamental bottleneck in numerous high-impact domains, including drug discovery, protein engineering, materials science, combinatorial optimization, and optimizing large AI models (as highlighted in the task description). If successful, the proposed method's potential to drastically reduce the number of expensive function evaluations could enable progress in these areas that is currently computationally prohibitive. The expected contributions are substantial, promising both methodological advances and tangible benefits in key scientific and technological applications. The potential impact is clearly articulated and well-justified."
