    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the task description: efficient sampling/optimization in discrete spaces, particularly for black-box objectives with long-range/high-order correlations, using GFlowNets as a base. The proposed GNS-GFN framework perfectly matches the research idea, detailing the integration of a GNN surrogate, GFlowNet sampler, active learning, and reward calibration. Furthermore, it explicitly tackles key challenges identified in the literature review, such as surrogate accuracy, exploration/exploitation balance, handling high-order correlations (via GNNs), computational efficiency (via surrogate), and active learning strategy effectiveness. The chosen application domains (protein design, combinatorial optimization) are relevant to the task description's scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a clear background, specific research objectives, and significance. The methodology section provides a concise overview of the GNS-GFN framework, followed by detailed descriptions of each component, including mathematical formulations for the GNN surrogate, GFlowNet sampler, active learning, and reward calibration. The experimental design is well-articulated, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and implementation details. The language is precise and technical without being overly obscure. The inclusion of a placeholder for a framework diagram aids understanding. While minor implementation specifics could be further detailed, the overall proposal is immediately understandable and unambiguous."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While GFlowNets and GNN surrogates exist independently, the core novelty lies in their tight, iterative integration specifically for black-box discrete sampling. Combining GFlowNets with a GNN surrogate, refined via active learning and incorporating reward calibration to handle surrogate bias, represents a fresh approach distinct from standard GFlowNets (which struggle with black-box objectives) or typical Bayesian Optimization (which might use surrogates but different sampling mechanisms). The use of GNNs is well-motivated by the need to handle structured data and high-order correlations, a key challenge mentioned. The framework offers a new perspective on leveraging learned models (surrogates) to guide generative samplers (GFlowNets) efficiently."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations: GNNs for graph representation learning, GFlowNets for diverse discrete sampling, active learning for query efficiency, and surrogate modeling. The methodology is well-justified, with appropriate choices for model architectures (message-passing GNNs), training objectives (MSE for surrogate, Trajectory Balance for GFlowNet), and techniques (uncertainty sampling for active learning, importance weighting for calibration). The mathematical formulations presented are standard and appear correct. The proposal acknowledges potential complexities, such as the trade-off between surrogate fidelity and GFlowNet performance, which it aims to investigate. The overall approach is technically coherent and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. GNNs and GFlowNets are active research areas with available software frameworks, although GFlowNet implementations might be less mature than GNNs. Active learning techniques are well-established. The main feasibility challenge lies in the computational cost of iteratively training both the GNN surrogate and the GFlowNet, as well as acquiring true objective function evaluations. However, the proposal's core aim is precisely to *reduce* the number of expensive true evaluations, making it potentially more feasible than alternatives for costly black-box problems. The experimental plan is realistic, using standard benchmarks and appropriate baselines. The risks associated with surrogate accuracy and training stability are typical research challenges rather than fundamental infeasibilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in machine learning and scientific discovery: efficient exploration of large, complex discrete spaces where objective functions are black-box and expensive to evaluate. Success in this research could lead to major advancements by drastically reducing the computational cost (potentially 5-10x fewer queries, as claimed) for problems in protein engineering, drug discovery, materials science, large language model posterior sampling, and combinatorial optimization. By enabling the modeling of high-order correlations via GNNs, it tackles a key limitation of existing methods. The potential to democratize access to powerful optimization techniques in resource-constrained domains further underscores its significance."
