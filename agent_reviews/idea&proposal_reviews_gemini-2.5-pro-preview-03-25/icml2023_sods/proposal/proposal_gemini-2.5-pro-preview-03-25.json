        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge highlighted in the task description: efficient sampling/optimization in discrete spaces, particularly for black-box objectives with complex correlations where standard GFlowNets might be sample-inefficient. The proposed GNS-GFN framework is a direct elaboration of the research idea, combining GNN surrogates, GFlowNets, and active learning. The methodology explicitly tackles challenges identified in the literature review, such as surrogate accuracy, exploration/exploitation balance, and active learning strategy design. The chosen application domains (combinatorial optimization, molecules, text generation) are consistent with those mentioned in the source materials."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The background, research gap, proposed idea (GNS-GFN), and objectives are articulated precisely. The methodology section provides a detailed step-by-step description of the iterative framework, including specific architectural choices (MPNNs, Deep Ensembles), training objectives (TB loss), and active learning strategies. Equations are used effectively to clarify technical aspects. The experimental design is comprehensive and easy to understand. While minor implementation details could always be added, the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components (GFlowNets, GNNs as surrogates, active learning) are known, their specific synergistic integration into an iterative closed-loop system (GNS-GFN) for black-box discrete sampling/optimization appears novel. The core idea of using the GFlowNet to generate diverse candidates for active learning, and then using the true evaluations to refine both the GNN surrogate and recalibrate the GFlowNet's effective reward (R_{eff}), distinguishes it from standard Bayesian Optimization or standalone GFlowNet approaches. The literature review confirms GFlowNets are a recent area, and this specific combination for sample efficiency in the black-box setting is not explicitly covered in the cited works, representing a fresh approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations: GFlowNets (using standard TB loss), GNNs (using standard MPNNs), and active learning principles (UCB, uncertainty sampling). The use of Deep Ensembles for uncertainty quantification is a standard and robust technique. The proposed iterative framework is logical, and the mechanism for incorporating true rewards (R_{eff}) to guide the GFlowNet is a reasonable approach to mitigate surrogate bias. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (including BO) and metrics. Potential challenges like computational cost and convergence are implicitly acknowledged through the experimental plan and metrics, although theoretical convergence analysis is absent (which is common for such empirical proposals)."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges and computational demands. The core technologies (GFlowNets, GNNs, active learning frameworks) are available. However, integrating them into the proposed iterative loop requires significant engineering effort. Training GNN ensembles and GFlowNets repeatedly can be computationally expensive, especially for large state spaces or complex objects. Tuning the hyperparameters of the GNN, GFlowNet, active learning strategy, and the overall loop will require careful experimentation. While the plan is realistic, the resource requirements (compute time, potentially specialized hardware like GPUs) are substantial, placing it at the higher end of feasibility without dedicated resources."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical and widely recognized bottleneck: the sample inefficiency of exploring large, discrete spaces when objective function evaluations are expensive (black-box setting). This problem is prevalent in high-impact domains like drug discovery, materials science, protein engineering, and controlling large generative models (LLMs), as highlighted in the task description and proposal. A successful GNS-GFN framework, demonstrating significant improvements in sample efficiency, would represent a major advancement with transformative potential for accelerating scientific discovery and enhancing AI capabilities in these areas. The methodological contribution of effectively combining these techniques is also significant for the ML community."
