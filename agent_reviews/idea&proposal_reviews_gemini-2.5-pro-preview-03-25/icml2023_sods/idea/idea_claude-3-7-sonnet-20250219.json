        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenges mentioned: efficiency in high-dimensional discrete spaces, limitations of current methods (gradient-based, continuous embedding) for black-box objectives and long-range correlations. It proposes a new algorithm paradigm (ASP) aimed at overcoming these limitations, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goal of discussing limitations and brainstorming new paradigms. Furthermore, it explicitly targets application domains highlighted in the task description, such as language and protein modeling."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (adaptive spectral partitioning), and key components (hierarchical structure, online spectral decomposition, block sampling, multi-temperature) are explained. However, some technical details lack full precision, leading to minor ambiguities. For instance, how the 'covariance matrix' is defined and computed efficiently online for high-dimensional discrete variables, and the exact mechanism for using spectral properties to guide partitioning could be elaborated further for complete understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While spectral methods, block sampling, and annealing are known techniques, their proposed integration into an 'Adaptive Spectral Partitioning' framework for general discrete space sampling appears innovative. Specifically, using online spectral decomposition to dynamically identify correlated variable blocks for sampling, without relying on gradients, presents a fresh perspective compared to the gradient-based, embedding-based, or existing proposal strategies mentioned in the task description. It offers a potentially new way to handle long-range dependencies."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility is somewhat questionable and presents potential challenges. The core mechanism relies on online spectral decomposition of a covariance-like matrix for high-dimensional discrete variables. Defining such a matrix meaningfully and computing its spectral properties (even low-rank approximations) repeatedly online can be computationally very expensive, potentially undermining the goal of 'efficiency'. The scalability of this approach to the dimensions encountered in modern language or protein models is uncertain without further details on approximations or implementation strategies. Significant effort might be needed to make this practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant due to its potential impact. Efficient sampling in high-dimensional discrete spaces, especially for black-box objectives and problems with complex dependencies, is a critical bottleneck in many important fields mentioned (language modeling, protein design, combinatorial optimization). A successful gradient-free method that captures long-range correlations, as proposed, could lead to major advancements in these areas, enabling new applications and scientific discoveries."
