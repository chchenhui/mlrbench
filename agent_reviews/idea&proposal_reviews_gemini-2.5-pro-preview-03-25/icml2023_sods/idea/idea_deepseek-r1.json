    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenge of sampling/optimization in high-dimensional discrete spaces, particularly for black-box objectives and correlated variables (like text/proteins), which are explicitly mentioned as key difficulties and application areas in the task description. The proposed method leverages embedding into a continuous space and uses gradient information (via a proxy model), aligning perfectly with the recent research trends highlighted in the task. It aims to overcome the limitations of existing methods concerning black-box functions and complex correlations, directly contributing to the goals outlined for the workshop (discussing limitations, brainstorming new paradigms, connecting to applications)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is clearly articulated. The motivation, core components (VAE, proxy model, latent space MCMC), and overall workflow are well-defined. It explains *why* this approach is needed (issues with existing methods) and *how* it works conceptually. The specific mention of VAEs, gradient-based MCMC in latent space, and the role of the proxy model makes the proposal understandable. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact mechanism for ensuring 'invertible, validity-preserving decoding' and the specifics of the proxy model's iterative refinement, but the overall concept is presented with good clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty through the specific combination and application of existing concepts. While VAEs for discrete data, latent space sampling, and proxy models for black-box optimization are known techniques, their integration here is targeted and potentially innovative. Specifically, the combination of a VAE focused on validity-preserving decoding with latent-space gradient-based MCMC guided by an *iteratively refined* proxy model for complex discrete structures (text/proteins) under black-box objectives offers a fresh perspective. The emphasis on maintaining validity through the decoder and adapting the proxy model within this framework distinguishes it from more standard applications of these individual components."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible using current machine learning techniques, but presents moderate implementation challenges. Training VAEs on sequences and structures is standard, although ensuring strict validity preservation upon decoding can be complex and may require specialized architectures or regularization. Training a proxy model is feasible, but its accuracy for complex black-box functions is crucial and might be difficult to achieve. Iterative refinement adds complexity. Running MCMC in the latent space is standard, provided the proxy model yields useful gradients. Integrating these components requires careful engineering and significant computational resources. Success hinges on the quality of the VAE embedding and the proxy approximation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. It tackles a fundamental and challenging problem in machine learning and related fields â€“ efficient exploration of complex, high-dimensional discrete spaces, especially when objective function gradients are unavailable. The target applications, text generation and protein design, are areas of major current interest with substantial real-world implications. A successful implementation could lead to more effective methods for discovering novel molecules, optimizing combinatorial problems, or controlling generation processes in large models, representing a meaningful contribution to the field."
