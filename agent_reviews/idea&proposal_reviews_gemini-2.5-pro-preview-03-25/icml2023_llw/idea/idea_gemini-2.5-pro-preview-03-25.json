    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the limitations of global backpropagation (latency, memory, synchronization) highlighted in the workshop call. It proposes a localized learning method (Forward-Forward), explicitly targets edge devices and streaming data, incorporates asynchronous updates, and aims for low-latency adaptation, all of which are listed as key interests or directly implied by the workshop's focus on overcoming global learning constraints."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation, core concept (asynchronous forward-forward on edge), and key mechanism (adaptive weighting based on recency/reliability) are explained. The target application domain is specified. Minor ambiguities exist regarding the precise nature of the 'local goodness functions' and the exact implementation details of the 'adaptive weighting' and 'reliability metrics', but the overall research direction is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While Forward-Forward learning and asynchronous updates are existing concepts, the proposed contribution lies in their specific combination and adaptation for heterogeneous edge environments. The core novelty is the 'Adaptive Asynchronous' aspect applied to Forward-Forward, particularly the mechanism for adaptively weighting updates based on recency and reliability to handle asynchronicity and device heterogeneity in a distributed, local learning setting. This specific formulation for edge devices appears novel."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Forward-Forward is implementable, and asynchronous communication is standard in distributed systems. Local performance monitoring is also feasible. However, designing effective local goodness functions, developing a robust and stable adaptive weighting mechanism, and efficiently estimating reliability metrics in a heterogeneous edge environment present moderate implementation challenges. Significant engineering effort and careful algorithmic design would be required, but it doesn't rely on unavailable technology or fundamentally unsolved theoretical problems."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Enabling efficient, low-latency, real-time learning directly on resource-constrained edge devices addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying advanced AI applications (like real-time video analytics, sensor fusion) in decentralized settings. Success would represent a meaningful contribution to edge AI, localized learning, and potentially biologically plausible learning paradigms, reducing reliance on centralized computation and enabling faster adaptation to dynamic environments."
