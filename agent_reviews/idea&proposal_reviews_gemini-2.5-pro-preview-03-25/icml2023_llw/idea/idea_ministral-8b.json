    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. It directly addresses the limitations of global end-to-end learning (memory footprint, latency, synchronization, biological implausibility) highlighted in the workshop call. It proposes using decoupled learning, asynchronous updates, and focuses specifically on edge devices, all of which are explicitly listed as relevant topics for the workshop. The motivation and goals align perfectly with the workshop's theme of localized learning for resource-constrained environments."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly and is well-defined. The motivation, main concept (decentralized framework using decoupled learning on edge devices), methodology (partitioning, independent training, asynchronous updates), and expected outcomes (resource efficiency, low latency, biological plausibility) are articulated well. While specific algorithmic details (e.g., exact partitioning strategy, nature of local objectives) are not provided, the overall research direction and approach are easily understandable, which is appropriate for an initial idea description."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Decoupled learning, asynchronous training, and ML on edge devices are existing research areas. The novelty lies primarily in the specific combination and application of these concepts into a cohesive decentralized training framework tailored for edge computing constraints. It proposes a specific approach rather than a fundamentally new learning paradigm. While not groundbreaking, the synthesis and focus on edge-specific challenges offer a degree of originality."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. Partitioning neural networks and training modules independently are established concepts. Simulating or deploying models on edge devices is achievable with current technology. Asynchronous updates are implementable. However, challenges exist in designing local objectives that ensure good overall model performance, managing potential communication overhead (even if minimized), ensuring convergence in a decentralized setting, and evaluating robustness across diverse edge hardware. These challenges require research effort but do not render the idea impractical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea holds significant potential impact. Enabling efficient, low-latency, on-device training for edge devices addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying advanced AI in real-world applications like IoT, autonomous systems, and real-time analytics. Success would contribute meaningfully to the field of edge AI by improving scalability, privacy, and responsiveness. Overcoming the limitations of traditional centralized training for these scenarios is an important research goal."
