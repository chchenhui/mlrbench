        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of integrating AI-for-Science and foundation models, with a specific focus on multi-modal inputs for diverse scientific problems, which is explicitly listed as an 'Opportunity' in the task. The idea mentions specific scientific domains (astrophysics, biomedicine, computational science) covered by the task, and aims to tackle key goals like accelerating discovery, handling multi-modal data, and ensuring compatibility with existing tools, all mentioned in the task description. It also implicitly touches upon 'Progress' aspects like scalability and reusability. The only minor gap is the lack of explicit focus on the 'Challenges' section of the task (failure diagnosis, hallucination, uncertainty)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is generally clear and well-articulated. The motivation, main goal (developing multi-modal foundation models for science), expected outcomes, and potential impact are clearly stated. However, the description of the methodology ('training foundation models on diverse scientific datasets', 'fine-tuned for specific scientific tasks') remains high-level. It lacks specific details regarding the proposed model architectures, the nature of the 'other modalities' besides text and images, the specific datasets to be used, or the precise fine-tuning strategies. While the overall concept is understandable, more technical detail would enhance precision."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea possesses good novelty. While applying foundation models to science is a growing field (as noted in the task description), the specific focus on developing *multi-modal* foundation models tailored for *diverse scientific domains* (beyond standard vision/language) and integrating various scientific data types (text, images, potentially simulations, sensor data, etc.) is innovative. Existing multi-modal models often focus on web-scale data; adapting and developing such models for the unique challenges and data types across multiple scientific fields represents a fresh perspective and a non-trivial extension of current work. Ensuring compatibility with classic scientific tools is practical but adds less to the core scientific novelty."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training large multi-modal foundation models requires substantial computational resources (large GPU clusters, extensive training time). A major hurdle is the acquisition, curation, and harmonization of diverse, high-quality multi-modal datasets from various scientific domains, which are often siloed, heterogeneous, and less abundant than general web data. Developing architectures that can effectively process these diverse scientific data types is also complex. While conceptually sound within current AI capabilities, the practical execution requires significant investment in resources, data engineering, and potentially algorithmic development, making it ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Successfully developing multi-modal foundation models tailored for science could revolutionize scientific discovery by enabling researchers to analyze complex, multi-source data more effectively and efficiently. It directly addresses the need for tools that can handle the increasing volume and complexity of scientific data. Potential impacts include accelerating breakthroughs in critical areas (e.g., medicine, materials science, climate change), fostering interdisciplinary research by providing common tools, and improving the understanding of complex systems. It aligns perfectly with the strategic importance of AI-for-Science."
