        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The task explicitly lists 'How to quantify the scientific uncertainty of foundation models?' as a key challenge under the 'Challenges' topic. The proposed idea directly addresses this question by focusing on developing a Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification (UQ) specifically tailored for scientific foundation models. It aligns with the overall theme of integrating AI-for-Science and foundation models, acknowledging the need for rigorous methods when applying these models to scientific problems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation highlights the critical need for UQ in scientific FMs. The main idea is broken down into four specific, understandable components: scalable variational inference for BNNs, incorporating scientific priors, developing specific calibration metrics, and creating visualization tools. The expected outcome and its importance are clearly articulated. There is minimal ambiguity in the proposal's core concepts and goals."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While Bayesian methods for UQ are established in ML, their application and adaptation to the scale and specific constraints of *scientific foundation models* is an active and less explored research area. The novelty lies particularly in the proposed integration of domain-specific scientific laws as Bayesian priors within a scalable framework for large models, and the development of science-specific calibration metrics. It combines existing techniques in a novel context to address a specific, emerging challenge, rather than proposing a fundamentally new UQ paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Scaling Bayesian methods, particularly variational inference, to the size of modern foundation models (often billions of parameters) is computationally extremely demanding and an area of ongoing research. Implementing and validating these methods requires substantial computational resources and expertise. Furthermore, effectively encoding diverse scientific laws and constraints as Bayesian priors across different domains is non-trivial and requires careful formulation. While conceptually sound, the practical implementation at the scale of foundation models faces considerable technical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Reliable uncertainty quantification is a critical bottleneck for the trustworthy adoption of foundation models in high-stakes scientific research (e.g., drug discovery, climate modeling, materials science). Providing scientists with not just predictions but also reliable confidence levels is essential for integrating these models into rigorous scientific workflows. Success in this area would represent a major advancement, enhancing the reliability and utility of FMs for scientific discovery and addressing a key challenge highlighted in the task description."
