        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the core theme of integrating foundation models into scientific domains. Specifically, it tackles one of the key 'Challenges' listed in the task description: 'How to align scientific foundation models with scientific facts without hallucination?'. Furthermore, it touches upon the 'Opportunities' by proposing integration with 'classic scientific tools' (symbolic engines/solvers) and aiming to 'accelerate scientific discovery'. The mentioned application domains (drug discovery, quantum mechanics, materials science) are explicitly listed or fall under the broader categories invited by the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (hallucination problem in scientific FMs), the proposed solution (hybrid symbolic-neural approach), the mechanisms (constrained loss, inference validation), and the expected outcomes (reduced hallucination, accelerated discovery) are articulated concisely and logically. The inclusion of a specific example (materials science) further enhances understanding. There are no significant ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While hybrid symbolic-neural approaches exist (Neurosymbolic AI), applying this specifically to large-scale foundation models for scientific discovery, with the explicit goal of enforcing scientific principles (laws, equations) during both training (via loss) and inference (via validation/refinement) to combat hallucinations, offers a fresh perspective. It's a novel combination and application of existing concepts tailored to the specific challenges of scientific foundation models, rather than a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Integrating symbolic constraints into loss functions is established (e.g., PINNs). However, developing robust symbolic modules (knowledge graphs, solvers) for complex scientific domains requires significant domain expertise and effort. Scaling the symbolic validation step efficiently for large foundation model outputs could be computationally demanding. Ensuring seamless interaction between the neural and symbolic components at scale is another challenge. Access to both large datasets and comprehensive symbolic knowledge is necessary. Overall, it's feasible with current technology but requires considerable resources and interdisciplinary expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing the hallucination problem is critical for the trustworthy application of foundation models in science, where factual accuracy is paramount. Success would greatly enhance the reliability and adoption of these models in high-stakes fields like biomedicine and materials science, potentially leading to major accelerations in discovery. Bridging data-driven AI with first-principles scientific knowledge is a fundamental challenge in AI-for-Science, and this work directly contributes to that goal."
