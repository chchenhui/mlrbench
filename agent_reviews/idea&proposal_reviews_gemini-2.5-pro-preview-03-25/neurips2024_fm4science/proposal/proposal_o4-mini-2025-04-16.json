    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns excellently with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of 'quantifying the scientific uncertainty of foundation models' highlighted in the task description. It fully elaborates on the research idea of creating a Bayesian UQ framework for scientific foundation models. Furthermore, it builds upon the concepts and addresses the key challenges (scalability, domain knowledge integration, calibration, interpretability) identified in the provided literature review, positioning itself clearly within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The background, research objectives, methodology, expected outcomes, and timeline are articulated concisely and logically. The structure is easy to follow, and the technical aspects, including the mathematical formulations for the BNN, VI, and priors, are presented clearly. The significance and potential impact are also well-explained."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While Bayesian methods, variational inference, domain-specific priors, and UQ metrics exist individually (as shown in the literature review), the novelty lies in their synthesis into a unified, scalable framework specifically tailored for *scientific foundation models*. Integrating domain-specific scientific laws into priors for large-scale BNNs applied to foundation models in diverse scientific domains (chemistry, materials, physics, biomedicine) represents a fresh and valuable contribution. It's not introducing a fundamentally new UQ paradigm but offers a novel and timely application and integration of existing techniques to a challenging new area."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and rigorous. It builds on established theoretical foundations (Bayesian inference, variational inference) and proposes appropriate methods (SGVB, specific prior formulations, standard calibration metrics). The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, datasets, and ablation studies. However, the soundness score is slightly moderated because several cited papers in the literature review (Doe & Smith, Johnson & Williams, Davis & Brown, Lee & Kim, White & Green, Black & Gray) appear to be placeholders or fictional, which weakens the demonstrated grounding in specific, verifiable prior work, even if the concepts they represent are valid. The proposed methods like mean-field VI have known limitations (e.g., underestimation of variance) which are not explicitly discussed as potential theoretical weaknesses."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It acknowledges the main challenge – computational overhead of scaling VI to foundation models – and proposes concrete mitigation strategies (GPU clusters, parameter sharing, low-rank approximations, fine-tuning only later layers). The use of standard benchmark datasets and established techniques (SGVB, common libraries) enhances feasibility. The 12-month timeline is ambitious but structured logically. Potential issues like prior misspecification and user adoption are considered with mitigation plans. Success depends heavily on access to significant computational resources and expertise in both ML and the scientific domains."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant. Quantifying uncertainty in foundation models is a critical bottleneck for their trustworthy adoption in scientific discovery, as highlighted in the task description and motivation. Successfully developing the BUQF framework would address this gap, potentially leading to increased trust, better experimental design, safer high-stakes decisions (e.g., drug design, materials science), and accelerated scientific progress. The planned open-source library and best practices would have a substantial impact on the AI4Science community."
