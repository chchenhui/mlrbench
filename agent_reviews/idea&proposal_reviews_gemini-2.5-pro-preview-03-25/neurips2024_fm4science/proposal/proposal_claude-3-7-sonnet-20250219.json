        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the key challenge of 'How to quantify the scientific uncertainty of foundation models?' highlighted in the task description. It systematically expands on the core research idea, detailing the proposed Bayesian framework. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the concepts and challenges identified in the literature review, such as scalable Bayesian inference, domain knowledge integration via priors, calibration metrics, and visualization, positioning the work within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and objectives to detailed methodology, validation, and expected impact. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section clearly outlines the four core components and details the techniques to be employed (e.g., specific VI approximations, types of priors, evaluation metrics, visualization approaches). The language is precise and technical where necessary, making the proposal readily understandable to an expert audience."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal exhibits good novelty. While Bayesian methods for UQ are established, the novelty lies in the specific focus on adapting, scaling, and integrating these methods into a comprehensive framework tailored for *scientific foundation models*. Key innovative aspects include the proposed techniques for scalable inference on massive models (matrix-variate, low-rank, layer-wise), the systematic approach to incorporating diverse scientific domain knowledge (physics-informed, structure-preserving, multi-fidelity, expert-elicited priors), and the development of domain-specific calibration and visualization tools. It represents a novel synthesis and application rather than a completely new UQ paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates rigor. It is well-grounded in Bayesian statistics and deep learning principles. The proposed methodologies (Variational Inference variants, MC Dropout, specific prior formulations, calibration metrics) are appropriate and draw from established research, including papers cited in the literature review. The inclusion of mathematical formulations adds precision. The validation plan is comprehensive. Potential weaknesses relate to the practical challenges of scaling VI to the largest foundation models and effectively implementing complex priors, but the proposed approaches represent credible research directions to address these challenges."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but ambitious. The primary challenge is the scalability of Bayesian inference techniques to potentially billion-parameter foundation models; while scalable methods are proposed, their effectiveness at this extreme scale requires demonstration and significant computational resources. Integrating diverse scientific priors robustly across different domains is also challenging and requires deep domain expertise alongside ML skills. The multi-domain validation plan is extensive. However, the proposal acknowledges scalability issues and suggests pragmatic approaches (e.g., calibrated dropout as a fallback). With adequate resources and expertise, the project is feasible, albeit challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem. As foundation models are increasingly applied in science, ensuring their reliability through robust UQ is critical for trustworthy scientific discovery and high-stakes decision-making. Successfully developing the BaySciUQ framework would represent a major advancement, enabling scientists to better interpret and utilize foundation model outputs, potentially accelerating research, guiding experiments, and improving safety in scientific AI applications. The project directly tackles a key bottleneck identified in the task description and the broader field."
