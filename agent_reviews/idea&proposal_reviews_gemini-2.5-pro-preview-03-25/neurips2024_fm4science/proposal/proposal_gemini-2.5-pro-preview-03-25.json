    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for Scientific Foundation Models (SciFMs) highlighted in the task description. The objectives and methodology systematically incorporate the key elements of the research idea (Bayesian framework, scalability, scientific priors, calibration, visualization). Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon the provided literature review, addressing the identified challenges (scalability, domain knowledge integration, calibration, interpretability) and citing relevant papers (e.g., Psaros et al., White & Green, Johnson & Williams, Davis & Brown, Lee & Kim, Black & Gray) to support its approach. The proposal successfully synthesizes the requirements and context into a coherent research plan."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with background and problem definition, moving to specific objectives, detailing the methodology, and concluding with expected outcomes and impact. The language is precise, and key concepts (Bayesian inference, VI, ELBO, scientific priors) are explained adequately within the context. The research objectives are specific and measurable. The methodology section provides substantial detail on the planned approach, including technical formulations and experimental design. While some implementation details remain flexible (e.g., exact architecture adaptations), this is appropriate for a proposal, and the overall plan is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While individual components like Bayesian UQ, Variational Inference, and incorporating domain knowledge exist in SciML (as shown in the literature review), the novelty lies in their specific synthesis and application to the unique scale and context of Scientific Foundation Models. The focus on developing *scalable* Bayesian methods *specifically for FMs* and the systematic approach to integrating *diverse scientific knowledge (laws, constraints, symmetries) as informative priors* within this framework is a key innovative aspect. Developing science-specific calibration metrics and tailored visualizations further enhances the novelty. It represents a significant step beyond applying existing UQ methods directly, addressing a critical gap identified in the task description and literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations in Bayesian statistics and machine learning, particularly Variational Inference. The choice of VI is well-justified for scalability, referencing relevant literature (White & Green, 2023). The proposed methods for incorporating scientific priors (Johnson & Williams, 2023) and developing calibration metrics (Davis & Brown, 2024) are conceptually sound and informed by recent research. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines (Black & Gray, 2024), diverse domains, relevant metrics, and ablation studies. Technical formulations (ELBO, predictive distribution) are correctly presented. Potential challenges, such as the interaction between priors and VI optimization, are acknowledged."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents significant technical and computational challenges. Scaling Bayesian inference (even VI) to foundation model sizes requires substantial computational resources (GPU clusters) and advanced engineering (SVI, Flipout, potentially parameter-efficient Bayesian methods). Implementing diverse scientific priors effectively and ensuring they integrate well with the optimization process is non-trivial and may require domain-specific expertise. While the proposal outlines standard and state-of-the-art techniques to address these challenges and leverages existing datasets, the successful execution depends heavily on access to adequate resources and specialized expertise. The plan is realistic but ambitious, carrying moderate implementation risks, hence the score of 7."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and timely problem. The lack of reliable uncertainty quantification is a major bottleneck preventing the trustworthy adoption of powerful foundation models in high-stakes scientific domains (as highlighted in the Task Description). Successfully developing a robust and scalable UQ framework that incorporates scientific knowledge would have a substantial impact. It would enhance the reliability of SciFMs, improve scientific decision-making, potentially accelerate discovery by guiding research efforts, and promote the alignment of AI models with scientific principles. The potential contributions to both scientific practice and foundational ML research (scalable Bayesian methods) are considerable."
