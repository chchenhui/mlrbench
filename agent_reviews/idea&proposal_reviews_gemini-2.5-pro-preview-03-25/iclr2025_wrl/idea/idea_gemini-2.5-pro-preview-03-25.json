        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the workshop task description. It directly addresses the theme of 'Towards Robots with Human-Level Abilities' by focusing on complex, long-horizon tasks like 'tidying up a house'. It falls squarely within the specified areas of interest, particularly 'Novel ML algorithms and model architectures for robot control' (explicitly mentioning LMM integration) and 'Applications in unstructured and dynamic environments' (household assistance). The idea tackles core challenges in embodied learning, decision-making, and perception mentioned in the call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with excellent clarity. The motivation clearly outlines the problem of long-horizon tasks and the limitations of existing methods. The proposed solution – integrating LMMs with a skill library via a state-conditioned probabilistic policy for adaptive sequencing – is well-defined and understandable. The role of RL/IL for fine-tuning and the expected outcome are also clearly stated. Only minor details about the specific architecture or state representation might require further elaboration, but the core concept is crystal clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty. While leveraging Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) for robot planning and control is an active area of research, the specific proposal to have the LMM generate a *probabilistic policy* over skill transitions, conditioned on the *current environmental state* for *adaptive* execution, offers a distinct approach compared to generating static plans or direct low-level actions. This focus on adaptive, closed-loop skill sequencing using LMMs as policy generators represents a fresh perspective on integrating LMM reasoning with robust robot execution."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Pre-trained LMMs are available, and learning low-level robot skills is a standard technique. Integrating these components is architecturally possible. However, fine-tuning the LMM's sequencing policy using RL or IL, especially for robust real-world execution, requires significant data (either simulated or real), computational resources, and careful engineering to ensure grounding and handle potential sim-to-real gaps. These challenges are common in advanced robotics research but make the implementation non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea holds significant potential impact. Enabling robots to reliably perform complex, multi-step tasks like tidying a room in unstructured human environments is a major bottleneck and a key step towards achieving human-level abilities. Successfully implementing an adaptive skill composition framework using LMMs could lead to substantial advancements in robot autonomy, particularly for household assistance and mobile manipulation, directly contributing to the workshop's goals."
