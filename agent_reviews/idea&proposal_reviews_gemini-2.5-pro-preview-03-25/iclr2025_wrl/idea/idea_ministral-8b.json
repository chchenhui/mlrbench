        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description (Robot Learning Workshop: Towards Robots with Human-Level Abilities). It directly addresses the core theme of achieving human-level abilities in robots for tasks like cooking or tidying by focusing on perception and decision-making. Furthermore, it explicitly incorporates several key areas of interest mentioned in the call, including 'large multi-modal models', 'sim-to-real bridging', 'safe policy optimization', evaluation using 'standardized task suites', and applications in 'household assistance' and 'industrial automation'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation, main goal (enhancing perception via multi-modal learning), proposed methods (combining visual, auditory, tactile data; using large models, sim-to-real, safety), and expected outcomes (improved perception, decision-making, task performance) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution, and the expected impact, making it immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by proposing an integrated framework combining several cutting-edge techniques (large multi-modal models, specific modalities like tactile, sim-to-real, safe policy optimization) to tackle the challenge of human-level robotic abilities. While multi-modal learning, sim-to-real, and safe RL are individually established research areas, their specific combination and application towards enhancing general robotic perception for complex, unstructured tasks offers a fresh perspective and notable innovation. It's not entirely groundbreaking, as these components are known, but the synthesis and focus are novel."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Training large multi-modal models requires substantial computational resources and large, diverse datasets incorporating synchronized visual, auditory, and especially tactile data, which is difficult and expensive to collect in the real world. Sim-to-real transfer, particularly involving tactile sensing, remains a major research hurdle. Integrating these complex components (large models, multi-modal fusion, sim-to-real, safety) into a robust, working system requires considerable engineering effort and expertise. While conceptually sound, practical implementation faces non-trivial obstacles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant and impactful. Achieving human-level abilities in robots is a grand challenge in AI and robotics with transformative potential. Enhancing robotic perception through multi-modal learning is widely recognized as a critical bottleneck. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in robotics, enabling robots to perform complex tasks in unstructured environments like homes and factories, significantly impacting areas like assisted living, manufacturing, and logistics, directly aligning with the ambitious goals of the workshop."
