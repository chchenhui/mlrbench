        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of achieving robust robot capabilities beyond humanoid forms, focusing on key areas like sim-to-real bridging, data efficiency, and applications in unstructured environments. The methodology precisely implements the core research idea by integrating online system identification, meta-learning for adaptation, and uncertainty-aware control. Furthermore, it effectively incorporates and builds upon the concepts and specific papers mentioned in the literature review (e.g., AdaptSim, uncertainty quantification, MAML, stability guarantees), positioning the work within the current state-of-the-art and addressing identified challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure, starting with a clear background, defining specific research objectives, and outlining the significance. The methodology section breaks down the framework into distinct components, explaining the objective and technical approach for each (system ID, meta-learning, control) with appropriate mathematical formulations and references. The experimental design is detailed, specifying tasks, baselines, metrics, and protocol. The language is precise and technical, making the proposal readily understandable to experts in the field. The inclusion of a placeholder for a framework diagram further aids clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by proposing a unified framework that integrates three key techniques (online system ID, meta-learning for rapid adaptation, uncertainty-aware control) for *continuous* self-adaptation during real-world deployment. While the individual components draw inspiration from existing work cited in the literature review (MAML, probabilistic ensembles, MPC, AdaptSim), the novelty lies in their specific combination and application to achieve ongoing online adaptation, aiming to eliminate separate offline/online phases. It explicitly differentiates itself from prior work like AdaptSim by targeting faster, potentially single-step adaptation via meta-learning. The integration itself, focused on continuous refinement, represents a fresh approach to the sim-to-real problem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations and established methods in machine learning and control theory, such as neural network dynamics models, MAML, probabilistic ensembles for uncertainty quantification (Jensen-RÃ©nyi divergence), and Model Predictive Control. The mathematical formulations provided for the dynamics model, uncertainty metric, MAML updates, and MPC objective appear correct and are clearly presented. The methodology references relevant recent work, indicating awareness of the state-of-the-art. While the integration of multiple complex online components raises potential questions about stability and convergence (though stability literature is cited), the overall approach is well-justified and methodologically robust."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current robotics hardware, simulation tools, and machine learning techniques. The individual components (neural networks, MAML, MPC) are implementable. However, integrating them into a real-time, online system presents significant engineering challenges, particularly concerning the computational cost of updating probabilistic ensembles and solving the MPC optimization problem at each step during deployment. Achieving the desired data efficiency and ensuring stable online learning will require careful implementation and potentially algorithmic optimizations or hardware acceleration. Access to the specified robotic platforms (7-DoF arm, quadruped) is necessary but standard in robotics research labs. The experimental plan is well-defined and seems achievable, assuming the implementation challenges are overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and persistent problem in robotics: bridging the sim-to-real gap to enable robust robot performance in unstructured, real-world environments. Successfully developing a framework for continuous self-adaptation would represent a major advancement, potentially reducing the need for extensive manual tuning and improving robot autonomy, data efficiency, and robustness to unforeseen changes. The potential impact spans various applications highlighted in the task description (household assistance, disaster response) and aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of achieving human-level physical capabilities. The planned open-source release further enhances its potential impact on the research community."
