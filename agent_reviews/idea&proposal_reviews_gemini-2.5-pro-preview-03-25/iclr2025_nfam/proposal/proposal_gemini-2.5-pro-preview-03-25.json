    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging AM theory (modern Hopfield networks, EBMs) and mainstream ML practice (multimodal learning). The proposed CMHN framework is a direct implementation of the research idea, focusing on multimodal harmonization via associative memory. It explicitly targets the 'Multimodal architectures with associative memories' topic listed in the task description. Furthermore, it incorporates concepts and addresses challenges (e.g., cross-modal alignment, energy landscape optimization) highlighted in the provided literature review, citing relevant papers like Ramsauer et al. (2020) and FÃ¼rst et al. (2021), as well as conceptually similar (though some hypothetical) works."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to the proposed solution (CMHN), objectives, detailed methodology, and expected outcomes. The core concepts, such as the shared energy landscape, cross-modal interaction terms, and associative recall dynamics, are explained effectively. The methodology section provides specific details on the conceptual framework (including mathematical formulations), data, architecture, training algorithm (with loss function examples), and a comprehensive evaluation plan. Objectives are clearly listed. There are minimal ambiguities, making the proposal easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. The core idea of using modern Hopfield network dynamics (specifically extending continuous variants like Ramsauer et al.) within a unified energy landscape for *intrinsic* cross-modal harmonization and associative completion is a fresh perspective. While the literature review includes related work on memory in multimodal settings (Kim et al., 2022) and conceptually similar ideas (hypothetical papers from 2023-2025), the proposed CMHN framework, with its specific formulation of shared energy minimization driving multimodal pattern completion, appears distinct from existing methods like CLIP or even CLOOB, which focus more on representation learning via contrastive objectives. The novelty lies in the specific mechanism proposed for achieving multimodal association through Hopfield attractor dynamics."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations of modern Hopfield networks (Ramsauer et al., 2020), energy-based models, and established multimodal learning techniques (contrastive learning). The proposed extension of MHN principles to the multimodal domain is logically derived, and the mathematical formulations for the energy function and update dynamics are clearly presented and appear technically correct. The methodology is robust, including the use of pre-trained encoders, a hybrid training objective combining contrastive and energy-based losses, and a comprehensive evaluation plan with relevant baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Potential challenges like energy landscape optimization are implicitly acknowledged through the proposed methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current deep learning technology and methods. Implementing the CMHN layer based on MHN formulations within frameworks like PyTorch/TensorFlow is achievable for skilled researchers. The reliance on standard pre-trained encoders and publicly available datasets is practical. The proposal realistically acknowledges the need for significant computational resources (GPU clusters), which is standard for large-scale multimodal research. While optimizing the novel energy function and dynamics presents a research challenge, the overall plan, including preliminary experiments on smaller datasets, is realistic. The risks involved are typical for cutting-edge ML research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical challenge in multimodal AI: achieving deeper semantic integration and associative reasoning across modalities, moving beyond surface-level alignment. Success would represent a substantial advancement, potentially leading to more coherent, robust, and human-like AI systems. The work directly aligns with the workshop's goals by bridging AM theory and ML practice and proposing a novel AM-based architecture for a key AI problem. The potential impact spans improved multimodal understanding, new applications (cross-modal search, generation), and providing a practical demonstration of modern AMs' utility in large-scale systems."
