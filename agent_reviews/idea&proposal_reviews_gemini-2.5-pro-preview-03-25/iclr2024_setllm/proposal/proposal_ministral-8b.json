    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is excellently aligned with the task description (Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy LLMs, specifically addressing fact verification/hallucination), the research idea (proactive detection via internal confidence calibration), and the literature review (building upon concepts like internal states, contrastive learning, and calibration for hallucination detection). It directly tackles a listed workshop topic and elaborates the core research idea coherently, positioning itself well within the context of recent related work."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured. The background, objectives, methodology overview, experimental design, and expected impact are understandable. However, there are minor ambiguities. The specific formulation of the contrastive loss function is non-standard and requires clarification or correction for better understanding and reproducibility. Additionally, the precise mechanism linking the contrastive learning objective to the calibration of specific inference-time confidence metrics (like entropy or activation mean) could be articulated more explicitly."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The proposal has minimal originality. The core concepts – using internal states for confidence/hallucination detection and employing contrastive learning for this purpose – are present in very recent literature cited in the review (e.g., InternalInspector, MIND, Li et al. 2025). The idea of 'proactive' or 'real-time' detection based on internal states is also explored in MIND. While the specific combination or implementation details might differ slightly, the proposal largely resembles existing approaches and lacks a clearly articulated, groundbreaking contribution beyond incremental refinement or combination of known techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat sound, grounding its approach in established methods (contrastive learning) and recent research trends (using LLM internal states). The overall methodology framework (data collection, feature extraction, evaluation) is reasonable. However, the specific contrastive loss function presented is questionable in its formulation and deviates from standard practices without clear justification, raising concerns about its technical correctness or optimality. Furthermore, the link between the contrastive training objective and the calibration of the proposed inference-time confidence metrics needs stronger theoretical or empirical justification."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. Data collection (factual statements, generated hallucinations) is achievable, potentially leveraging existing resources. Implementing contrastive learning and extracting internal states are technically possible with standard ML frameworks, assuming access to sufficient computational resources (which is a common requirement for LLM research). The main challenge, acknowledged by including inference speed as a metric, lies in ensuring the 'proactive' detection mechanism operates efficiently without introducing significant latency during generation, but recent work like MIND suggests this is attainable."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant and critical problem in the LLM field: hallucination generation, which severely impacts model trustworthiness and reliability. Developing effective, proactive methods to detect and flag hallucinations during generation would be a major advancement, enhancing user trust and enabling safer deployment of LLMs in various applications. The potential impact on both research and practical applications is substantial."
