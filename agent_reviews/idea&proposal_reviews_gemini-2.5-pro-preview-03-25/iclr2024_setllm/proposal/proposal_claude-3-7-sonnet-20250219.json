    "Consistency": {
        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The proposal is perfectly aligned with the task description (Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy LLMs, specifically addressing 'Reliability assurance' and 'Fact verification (e.g. hallucinated generation)'). It directly implements the research idea ('Proactive Detection of Hallucinations via Internal Confidence Calibration') by proposing the ProCalib framework. Furthermore, it explicitly references and builds upon multiple relevant papers from the literature review (e.g., InternalInspector, MIND, PRISM, Lyu et al., Li et al. 2025), demonstrating a clear understanding and integration of prior work. There are no inconsistencies between the proposal and the provided context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. It follows a logical structure (Introduction, Methodology, Expected Outcomes & Impact). The research objectives are explicitly stated. The methodology is broken down into understandable components (Dataset Creation, Internal State Extraction, Contrastive Fine-Tuning, Inference-Time Detection, Experimental Design). Technical details, including equations for confidence metrics and loss functions, are provided. The experimental plan is detailed and comprehensive. Minor abstractions exist (e.g., the exact form of the aggregation function 'f' and threshold function 'T(d, c)'), but these are acceptable at the proposal stage and do not hinder overall understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While using internal states for hallucination detection is explored in the literature (InternalInspector, MIND), ProCalib proposes a novel combination of techniques: 1) Integrating both contrastive learning and an explicit calibration loss for fine-tuning the confidence encoder. 2) Utilizing a comprehensive set of internal state features (attention, hidden states, MLP activations) aggregated via a learned encoder. 3) Incorporating adaptive batch construction (citing Li et al., 2025). 4) Focusing on proactive, real-time detection with dynamic thresholding and explicit uncertainty signaling during generation. While not entirely groundbreaking, this specific synthesis and refinement of existing concepts offer a fresh approach distinct from prior work cited."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, internal state analysis in LLMs) and established methods cited in the literature review. The proposed methodology, including internal state metrics, loss functions, and the confidence encoder, is well-justified and technically plausible. The experimental design is comprehensive, including comparisons with baselines, ablation studies, cross-domain generalization tests, human evaluation, and efficiency analysis, indicating methodological rigor. The technical formulations presented are correct. The reliance on a future-dated citation (Li et al., 2025) is unusual but doesn't invalidate the soundness of the proposed adaptive batching concept itself."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible but presents some challenges. Dataset creation, while ambitious involving multiple generation methods and verification steps, is achievable. Extracting diverse internal states across all layers is technically possible but can be computationally intensive, especially for large models. The contrastive fine-tuning process requires significant computational resources (GPU time, memory). Implementing the confidence encoder and aggregation for real-time inference requires careful optimization to meet the 'minimal computational overhead' claim. The scope of the experimental plan is extensive. Overall, the project is feasible within a well-resourced research environment but requires careful planning regarding computational efficiency and dataset construction effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses the critical problem of LLM hallucinations, a major barrier to their trustworthy deployment, directly aligning with the workshop's theme. Developing a proactive, internal mechanism for hallucination detection offers substantial advantages over slower, resource-intensive post-hoc methods. Success would enhance LLM reliability, enable deployment in high-stakes domains (healthcare, education), provide deeper insights into LLM knowledge representation, and potentially inform future model design. The clearly articulated potential impact on trustworthy AI is substantial."
