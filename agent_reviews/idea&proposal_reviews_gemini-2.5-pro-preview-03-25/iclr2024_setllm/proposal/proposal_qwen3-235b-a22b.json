    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy LLMs, specifically addressing reliability and fact verification/hallucination), the research idea (proactive detection via internal confidence calibration using contrastive learning), and the literature review (building upon cited works like InternalInspector, MIND, PRISM, and addressing identified challenges like calibration, generalization, and efficiency). It successfully integrates the problem context, the proposed solution, and relevant prior work into a coherent narrative. All sections consistently reinforce the core objective of enhancing LLM trustworthiness through internal mechanisms."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, the methodology (data collection, algorithmic approach, experimental design) is detailed and logically structured, and the expected outcomes are clearly articulated. The use of mathematical notation for the loss function and entropy calculation adds precision. The language is concise and academic. While the exact nature of the 'internal representations' (h_i, h_j) could be slightly more specified (e.g., specific layers or activation types), the overall proposal is immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several recent techniques (contrastive learning, internal state analysis, entropy-based thresholding) for the specific purpose of proactive, real-time hallucination detection. While the individual components exist in the cited literature (e.g., InternalInspector uses contrastive learning on internal states for confidence; MIND aims for real-time unsupervised detection), the specific combination, the focus on supervised contrastive learning for *proactive flagging* during generation via a learned threshold, and the direct comparison against a comprehensive set of recent baselines offers a novel contribution. It represents a strong incremental advancement rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly sound and rigorous. It is built upon solid theoretical foundations (contrastive learning, information theory for uncertainty) and leverages established methods validated in recent literature (internal state analysis for LLMs). The proposed methodology, including synthetic data generation strategy, contrastive loss formulation, entropy-based thresholding, and the experimental design (benchmarks, metrics, baselines), is robust and well-justified. The technical formulations provided are correct and clearly presented. The approach directly addresses challenges highlighted in the literature review."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current resources and technology typically available in ML research settings. It relies on standard techniques like LLM fine-tuning, contrastive learning, and established benchmark datasets. Access to pre-trained models (LLaMA-3, GPT-4) and compute resources for training is required but standard for this type of research. Data generation using LLMs is a common practice. Potential challenges include the computational cost of fine-tuning large models and achieving robust calibration/generalization, but these are inherent research difficulties rather than fundamental feasibility blockers. The plan is realistic with manageable risks."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and highly significant problem in the field of LLMs: hallucination, which severely impacts their trustworthiness and reliability. Developing a proactive, internal mechanism for hallucination detection would be a major advancement, particularly for applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and education. Success would contribute substantially to the development of more dependable AI systems and align directly with the goals of responsible AI development. The potential impact is substantial and clearly articulated."
