        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on 'Secure and Trustworthy Large Language Models', and the idea directly targets 'Fact verification (e.g. hallucinated generation)', which is explicitly listed as a key topic. It also touches upon 'Reliability assurance' and 'Interpretability', further strengthening its relevance to the workshop's theme of trustworthiness."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (reducing hallucinations), the proposed multi-stage method (retrieval, generation, contrastive verification), the training strategy (joint optimization), and the expected outcomes (reduced hallucinations, interpretability) are articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. Minor details about the verifier architecture or loss functions could be added, but the core concept is immediately understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by proposing a specific combination of existing techniques in a potentially innovative way. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fact verification are established areas, the novelty lies in the proposed joint training mechanism between the generator and a contrastively trained verifier, potentially sharing representations, specifically aimed at calibrating the LLM output based on retrieved evidence. The contrastive learning setup for the verifier using true vs. decoy citations adds another layer of specificity. It's not entirely groundbreaking but offers a fresh and refined approach to improving factual consistency in RAG systems."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. It relies on standard components like retrievers, LLMs, and knowledge bases. Training a verifier model using contrastive learning is a well-understood technique. While joint optimization can introduce engineering complexity, it's a known paradigm. Accessing or creating suitable training data (true vs. decoy citations, potentially derived from datasets like FEVER) is achievable, though it might require some effort. The evaluation plan uses standard benchmarks. Overall, implementation seems practical within a typical research environment."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly significant as it addresses the critical problem of LLM hallucinations, a major bottleneck for deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications. Reducing hallucinations and improving factuality directly contributes to LLM trustworthiness. The proposed method also aims to enhance interpretability by providing evidence snippets and confidence scores, which is crucial for user trust and debugging. Achieving the targeted reduction in hallucination rates would represent a substantial advancement in the field."
