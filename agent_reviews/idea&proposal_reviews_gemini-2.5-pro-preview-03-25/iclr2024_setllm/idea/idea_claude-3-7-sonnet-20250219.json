        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea directly addresses 'Fact verification (e.g. hallucinated generation)', which is explicitly listed as a key topic in the workshop task description. It focuses on combating hallucinations and enhancing LLM trustworthiness, aligning perfectly with the workshop's theme of 'Secure and Trustworthy Large Language Models' and its aim to discuss solutions for reliability assurance."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The motivation (combating hallucinations), the core proposal (integrated framework with dual-stream architecture), and key components (attribution, confidence scoring, self-monitoring, contrastive learning) are explained. However, the specific technical details of the 'differentiable attribution mechanism' and the 'confidence scoring system' could benefit from further elaboration, leaving minor ambiguities about their exact implementation."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While fact verification and attribution for LLMs are existing research areas, the proposed integrated, dual-stream architecture with simultaneous generation and evidence-backed attribution, combined with specific mechanisms like differentiable attribution, domain-specific confidence scoring, and self-monitoring during generation, offers a fresh perspective. The combination and integration of these elements, particularly the potentially end-to-end trainable attribution, represent a novel approach compared to standard post-hoc verification or simple retrieval-augmented generation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Developing a truly 'differentiable attribution mechanism' that effectively links generation to retrieved evidence within the gradient flow is technically complex. Curating and maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base is resource-intensive. The dual-stream architecture might increase computational overhead and latency. Fine-tuning with contrastive learning requires substantial curated data (factual vs. hallucinated statements with sources). While the components are conceptually known, their integration into a robust, efficient system requires considerable research and engineering effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant. LLM hallucination is a critical barrier to their reliable deployment, especially in high-stakes domains mentioned (education, healthcare, legal). Successfully developing a framework that intrinsically verifies facts and provides attribution would be a major advancement in LLM trustworthiness and accountability. It directly addresses a fundamental limitation of current models and could significantly impact the field and practical applications."
