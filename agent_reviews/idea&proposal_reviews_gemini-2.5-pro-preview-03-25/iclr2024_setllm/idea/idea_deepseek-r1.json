        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the task description. The workshop focuses on 'Secure and Trustworthy Large Language Models', and explicitly lists 'Adversarial attacks and defenses in LLMs' as a key topic. The idea directly addresses this by proposing a novel defense mechanism against a specific type of adversarial attack (latent-space/embedding manipulation) relevant to LLM security and reliability."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly states the motivation (addressing latent-space attacks), outlines a specific three-part methodology (detector, alignment layer, regularization), specifies the evaluation approach (datasets, attacks, metrics), and defines expected outcomes (robustness, low latency). Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the precise architectural details or the exact mechanism of dynamic gradient regularization, but the overall concept is well-defined and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While adversarial defense is a known area, the specific focus on latent-space embedding attacks in LLMs is less explored than input-level defenses. The proposed combination of a contrastive detector, an adversarially trained alignment layer, and dynamic gradient regularization specifically for the embedding space offers a fresh perspective. It builds upon existing techniques (contrastive learning, adversarial training) but applies them in a novel configuration to tackle a specific vulnerability."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current ML knowledge and resources. Training contrastive models, implementing adversarial training for specific layers, and applying gradient-based techniques are established practices. Access to LLMs, attack implementations (like HotFlip variants), and benchmark datasets is possible. However, integrating the three components effectively, ensuring the 'lightweight' nature of the detector, achieving robust alignment without degrading clean performance, and implementing dynamic regularization with truly 'minimal' latency present moderate engineering and research challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is significant and has clear impact potential. Adversarial robustness is a critical requirement for deploying LLMs safely, especially in high-stakes domains mentioned (healthcare, finance). Latent-space attacks represent a sophisticated threat vector. Developing effective defenses against them would be a meaningful contribution to LLM security and trustworthiness, potentially leading to more reliable and resilient models."
