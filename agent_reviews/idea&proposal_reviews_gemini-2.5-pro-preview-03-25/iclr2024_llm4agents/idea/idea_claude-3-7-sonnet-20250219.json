        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is excellently aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop topic 'Memory Mechanisms and Linguistic Representation' by proposing a specific architecture inspired by human memory. It also touches upon the 'Conceptual Framework for Language Agents' by drawing from cognitive science. Furthermore, improving memory is fundamental for enhancing 'Reasoning, Planning' in agents performing complex, long-running tasks, which is the core focus of the workshop on LLM agents."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. The core concepts of a dual-pathway memory (semantic network + forgetting mechanism) and the motivation are well-explained. However, some implementation details remain abstract, such as the specific algorithms for constructing/updating the semantic network, the precise nature of the forgetting algorithms beyond general metrics (recency, relevance, importance), and the exact setup for using reinforcement learning to optimize parameters. Minor refinements clarifying these aspects would improve precision."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While memory systems for LLMs exist (e.g., RAG, vector stores), the proposed combination of a structured semantic network (going beyond simple vector similarity) with explicit, biologically-inspired forgetting mechanisms (mimicking consolidation and pruning) optimized via RL offers a fresh perspective. The emphasis on active, intelligent forgetting, rather than just retrieval or context expansion, and the specific inspiration from human cognitive processes contribute notable novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents considerable implementation challenges. Building and maintaining a dynamic, large-scale semantic network integrated with an LLM is complex. Designing effective and computationally tractable forgetting algorithms that accurately capture relevance and importance is non-trivial. Training an RL agent to optimize these mechanisms adds another layer of complexity regarding reward definition and training stability. Significant engineering effort and computational resources would be required, making it challenging but not impossible with current technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Effective long-term memory management is a critical bottleneck for current LLM agents, limiting their ability to handle extended interactions and complex, multi-step tasks. Successfully implementing such a system could lead to major advancements in agent capabilities, enabling more coherent, context-aware, and efficient autonomous systems. Reducing reliance on ever-expanding context windows and achieving more human-like information retention would be substantial contributions to the field."
