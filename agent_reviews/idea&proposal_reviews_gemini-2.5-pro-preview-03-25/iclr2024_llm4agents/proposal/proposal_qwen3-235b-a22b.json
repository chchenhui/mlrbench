        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core theme of LLM agent memory mechanisms, drawing inspiration from cognitive science as suggested by the task description and research idea. The methodology incorporates semantic organization and dynamic forgetting, reflecting the main idea. Furthermore, it explicitly references and aims to tackle key challenges identified in the literature review, such as catastrophic forgetting, balancing retention/forgetting, temporal understanding, and evaluation metrics (citing relevant papers like Wang et al., 2025; Zhong et al., 2023)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives are explicitly listed, and the methodology section provides a good level of detail on the proposed architecture (semantic network, forgetting mechanism), including mathematical formulations for key components like temporal compression and the forget score. The experimental design is well-defined with datasets, baselines, and metrics. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise interaction mechanism between the semantic memory and the base LLM during generation, or finer details of the RL state/action space, but the overall concept and approach are understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like semantic networks, forgetting mechanisms (inspired by recency), and RL exist, their specific combination here is innovative. The novelty lies in the dual-pathway architecture integrating a hierarchical semantic graph with a multi-factor (recency, relevance, *and* RL-learned importance) dynamic forgetting mechanism. This approach, explicitly motivated by cognitive plausibility and optimized via RL for task performance *and* efficiency, distinguishes it from prior work like MemoryBank (simpler forgetting curve) or M+ (retriever-based). The emphasis on continuous, adaptive forgetting as a core part of the memory system, rather than just post-hoc unlearning, is also a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations from cognitive science (semantic memory, forgetting) and employs established machine learning techniques (graph representations, embeddings, hierarchical clustering, RL with PPO). The mathematical formulations presented for temporal compression, edge updates, and the forget score are appropriate. The methodology is generally well-defined. Potential minor weaknesses include the scalability of HAC for very large graphs and the inherent challenges in tuning RL reward functions effectively, but these are standard research challenges rather than fundamental flaws in the approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, but presents significant engineering complexity. Implementing and integrating the semantic network, the dynamic forgetting module, and the RL optimization loop requires substantial effort and computational resources (LLM access, GPU time for training). While the individual techniques exist, tuning the RL component for stable and effective optimization of forgetting parameters ( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\tau ) based on the proposed reward function could be challenging and time-consuming. Data requirements seem manageable, leveraging existing benchmarks and potentially requiring some simulation/modification."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant as it addresses critical and widely recognized limitations in current LLM agents: inefficient memory management, context window constraints, lack of long-term coherence, and the need for controlled forgetting/unlearning for ethical reasons (e.g., GDPR). Success in this research could lead to major advancements in LLM agent capabilities for complex, long-duration tasks, improve computational efficiency, and provide practical solutions for data privacy. The explicit link to cognitive science also adds scientific value by potentially offering insights into both artificial and human memory."
