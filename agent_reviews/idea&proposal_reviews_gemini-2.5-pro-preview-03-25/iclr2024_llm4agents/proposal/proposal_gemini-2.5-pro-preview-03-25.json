        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on LLM agents, memory mechanisms, reasoning, and cognitive science links. The proposed SMAF architecture perfectly matches the research idea, elaborating on the semantic network and adaptive forgetting concepts. It effectively integrates and references the provided literature, positioning the work relative to existing memory augmentation techniques (e.g., [2, 6, 10]) and contrasting the proposed adaptive forgetting with machine unlearning approaches (e.g., [1, 5, 9]). The problem statement clearly reflects the motivation and challenges highlighted in the idea and literature review (e.g., catastrophic forgetting [3, 8])."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and very well-defined. The structure is logical, progressing from background and problem statement to the proposed solution, objectives, methodology, and expected impact. The SMAF architecture, including the semantic network and adaptive forgetting mechanism, is explained in detail with specific components and metrics. The research objectives are unambiguous, and the methodology section provides concrete steps, including technical formulations for key scores and a clear plan for RL optimization and evaluation. While some implementation details remain high-level (as expected in a proposal), the overall concept, approach, and evaluation strategy are immediately understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality and innovation. While components like semantic memory graphs and forgetting mechanisms exist, the proposed integration within the SMAF architecture is novel. Key innovative aspects include: 1) Combining a structured semantic network with an *adaptive* forgetting mechanism driven by multiple cognitive heuristics (recency, relevance, importance). 2) The explicit goal of *memory consolidation* (episodic to semantic) as part of the forgetting process. 3) The application of Reinforcement Learning to *optimize the forgetting parameters* based on agent task performance, moving beyond fixed decay or simple heuristics seen in some prior work (e.g., [6]). It clearly distinguishes itself from pure RAG, simple memory buffers, and explicit unlearning techniques [1, 5, 7, 9], offering a fresh perspective on dynamic memory management for agent efficiency and coherence."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is well-grounded in cognitive science principles (semantic memory, adaptive forgetting) and established machine learning techniques (graph networks, embeddings, RL). The proposed methodology is detailed and logical, with clear definitions for the semantic network structure and the metrics driving the forgetting mechanism (recency, relevance, importance). The technical formulations for calculating scores are presented correctly. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, including relevant baselines, ablation studies, suitable tasks, and appropriate metrics. The use of RL (PPO) for parameter optimization is a valid, albeit complex, approach. Minor weaknesses include the potential complexity of tuning numerous parameters and the challenge of accurately estimating 'importance', but the overall technical approach is robust and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and expertise but presents significant engineering challenges. Implementing the semantic network, calculating forgetting scores, and integrating with an LLM are achievable. However, the system's overall complexity, managing potentially large graphs efficiently, and especially the successful implementation and training of the RL component for optimizing forgetting parameters, pose considerable hurdles. Training the RL agent requires substantial computational resources, careful reward engineering, and may face stability issues. Creating or adapting suitable long-duration evaluation environments also requires effort. While ambitious, the project is plausible within a well-equipped research setting, but the risks associated with the RL component and system complexity lower the feasibility score slightly."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It addresses a critical bottleneck in current LLM agent development: effective long-term memory management. Improving memory coherence, efficiency, and adaptability would enable agents to tackle much more complex, long-duration tasks, significantly advancing the field. The potential impacts include enhanced agent capabilities in diverse applications (research assistants, tutors, planners), improved computational efficiency (reduced reliance on large context windows), and contributions to understanding memory through a computational lens, aligning strongly with the workshop's themes. Success would represent a substantial contribution beyond simple RAG or static memory systems."
