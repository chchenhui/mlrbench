        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Memory Mechanisms' and 'Reasoning/Planning' for LLM agents. The methodology faithfully implements the core concepts outlined in the research idea (dual-pathway semantic memory, specific forgetting metrics, RL optimization). Furthermore, it positions itself clearly within the context of the provided literature, acknowledging relevant works (MemoryBank, RecallM, MeMo as baselines) and aiming to tackle key challenges identified (catastrophic forgetting, balancing retention/forgetting, efficiency)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-structured, with understandable objectives and a logical flow. The core concepts of the semantic network, forgetting metrics (Recency, Relevance, Importance), and RL optimization are explained. However, some technical details could be more precise. For instance, the mechanism for hierarchical integration ('linked to parent concepts via co-occurrence statistics') is vague, the exact calculation of 'Relevance' using attention needs more specification, and potential scalability challenges with graph operations like PageRank are not fully addressed. The reward weighting in RL ('task-specific weights') also lacks detail. Despite these minor ambiguities, the overall proposal is comprehensible."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synthesizing several concepts in a novel way for LLM agent memory. While hierarchical memory, forgetting mechanisms (like recency in MemoryBank), and RL optimization exist independently, their specific combination here – a hierarchical semantic graph pruned by a multi-factor (Recency, Relevance, Importance) forgetting mechanism whose parameters are optimized via RL based on task performance – appears distinct from the cited literature. It moves beyond simple vector retrieval or basic Ebbinghaus-inspired decay by incorporating graph structure (Importance) and task context (Relevance) dynamically optimized via RL, representing a fresh approach to adaptive long-term memory in agents."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound, built upon established concepts from cognitive science (semantic memory, forgetting) and machine learning (graph networks, embeddings, RL/PPO, PageRank). The proposed metrics for forgetting are conceptually relevant, and the mathematical formulations provided (similarity, recency decay) are standard. However, some aspects could benefit from further justification or detail regarding rigor. Potential scalability issues of the dynamic graph operations (similarity search, PageRank) are not fully addressed. The robustness of using attention for 'Relevance' across diverse tasks and the stability of the RL optimization loop with potentially complex rewards require careful consideration. The assumption that the linear combination of R, R, I is optimal could also be questioned."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. While the core technologies (LLMs, embedding models, RL frameworks, graph algorithms) exist, integrating them into the proposed dynamic SMAF system is complex. Implementing and efficiently managing a large-scale, dynamic hierarchical semantic graph with real-time updates, similarity searches, and PageRank calculations is non-trivial. Training the RL policy effectively requires careful reward engineering and substantial computational resources for simulation/experimentation across diverse tasks. The evaluation plan is also ambitious, requiring multiple complex datasets and metrics. Success depends heavily on significant engineering effort and computational resources, posing moderate risks to implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the field of LLM agents: managing memory effectively over long interactions to avoid catastrophic forgetting and maintain coherence without excessive computational cost. If successful, the SMAF architecture could lead to major advancements in the capabilities of LLM agents for complex, long-duration tasks (e.g., research assistance, planning, extended dialogues). The potential impact includes more capable and reliable AI agents, reduced computational overhead for long contexts, and valuable theoretical insights bridging AI and cognitive science, directly aligning with the workshop's core themes."
