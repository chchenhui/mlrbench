    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of 'Principled Foundations' by focusing on understanding In-Context Learning (ICL), a listed topic of interest. It also connects to 'Efficiency' (sample complexity, prompt design) and 'Responsibility' (bias propagation). The proposal faithfully elaborates on the core research idea of framing ICL as implicit Bayesian inference. Furthermore, it effectively integrates and builds upon the cited works from the literature review (Hahn & Goyal, Wies et al., Yang et al.), positioning itself to address the identified challenge of lacking a unified theoretical framework for ICL."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is crystal clear and well-defined. The research objectives are explicitly stated and measurable. The methodology is logically structured into three distinct phases (Formulation, Theory, Empirics), with clear hypotheses, steps, and proposed techniques (mathematical formalization, PAC-Bayes, information theory, specific experiments). The mathematical notation used is standard and presented appropriately for a proposal. The rationale, significance, and expected outcomes are articulated concisely and persuasively. The overall structure is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While the idea of connecting ICL to Bayesian inference exists in the literature (e.g., hinted at by Hahn & Goyal), this proposal's novelty lies in its specific focus on formalizing this link *mechanistically* through the transformer's attention layers. It aims to provide a *unified* Bayesian framework, derive specific theoretical bounds (sample complexity via PAC-Bayes applied to this Bayesian view), and design targeted empirical validation (probing attention alignment with posterior updates). This represents a significant and fresh perspective extending beyond existing fragmented explanations or purely empirical observations."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It is grounded in solid theoretical foundations (Bayesian inference, PAC-Bayes theory, information theory, transformer architecture). The proposed methodology is logical and appropriate for tackling the research questions. The mathematical formulations presented are standard. The empirical validation plan includes relevant datasets, models, experiments, and metrics. The core hypothesis linking attention directly to Bayesian updates is plausible and testable, although proving it rigorously constitutes the main research challenge. The overall approach is well-justified and technically coherent."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The required resources (access to LLMs, computational power for experiments) are standard for contemporary LLM research. The methodology, while theoretically challenging in parts (formalizing the attention-Bayesian link, deriving tight bounds), uses established techniques (PAC-Bayes, information theory, LLM probing). The empirical plan is practical and follows standard experimental procedures. The main risks involve the potential difficulty of the theoretical derivations and the possibility that the core hypothesis might be an oversimplification, but the overall plan is realistic for a dedicated research effort."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. Understanding the theoretical basis of ICL is a critical open problem in the field of large language models. Successfully developing a rigorous Bayesian framework would represent a major advancement in explaining emergent capabilities. The potential impact is substantial, offering insights for improving model efficiency (prompt design, architecture), robustness, and responsible AI practices (understanding bias propagation). It directly addresses key goals of the TF2M workshop, particularly regarding principled foundations, efficiency, and responsibility."
