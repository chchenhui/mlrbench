        "justification": "The idea is excellently aligned with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for research on 'Efficient training, finetuning, and inference algorithms' and 'Theoretical foundations of model compression, pruning, and distillation'. InfoPrune directly addresses model pruning for efficiency using an information-theoretic approach, which also aligns with the interest in 'Statistical and information-theoretic perspectives on model capabilities'. It fits perfectly within the 'Efficiency' and 'Principled Foundations' themes highlighted in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is crystal clear and well-defined. The motivation (FM costs, limitations of heuristics), the core mechanism (MI-based module scoring using variational estimators), the process (iterative pruning and fine-tuning), the target outcome (50-70% reduction, <=1% performance drop), and the unique selling proposition (theoretical performance bounds) are all articulated concisely and without significant ambiguity. It is immediately understandable what the research aims to achieve and how."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality. While pruning and information theory applied to neural networks are existing fields, the specific proposal to use variational MI estimators to quantify the contribution of *structured components* (heads, neurons) in *foundation models* for pruning, coupled with deriving *theoretical bounds* on performance degradation based on the summed MI of pruned components, offers a novel and principled approach compared to common magnitude-based or heuristic methods. It's a fresh perspective on FM compression."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible. Structured pruning and fine-tuning are standard techniques. Variational MI estimation methods exist, although applying them accurately and efficiently across numerous modules in very large FMs could present computational challenges. Deriving tight and practically useful theoretical bounds can also be difficult. However, the overall approach uses existing concepts and techniques, making implementation plausible, albeit potentially requiring significant computational resources and careful tuning of the MI estimators."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Compressing large foundation models is a critical challenge hindering their widespread deployment and increasing energy costs, directly aligning with the workshop's 'Efficiency' theme. Providing a principled, information-theoretic method with potential performance guarantees addresses a major limitation of current ad-hoc pruning techniques. Success would represent a major advancement in making FMs more efficient and their compression more predictable and reliable."
