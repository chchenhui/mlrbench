        "score": 10,
        "justification": "The research idea is perfectly aligned with the workshop's scope. It directly addresses key themes such as 'Improving reliability and truthfulness of LLMs' (Scope item 2) and 'Explainability and interpretability of language model responses' (Scope item 3). The focus on reducing hallucinations, verifying evidence, and providing interpretable justifications (the evidence graph) fits squarely within the workshop's goal of building trust in LLMs and bridging research with practical challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is crystal clear and well-defined. It outlines a specific 5-step process (Retrieval & Hypothesis Generation, Evidence Graph Construction, Self-Consistency Scoring, Selection & Explanation, Reinforcement Refinement) with a clear motivation and expected outcomes. The core concept of using a graph structure derived from citations for self-consistency scoring is immediately understandable. Minor details regarding specific graph metrics or the RL setup could be further specified, but the overall proposal is exceptionally clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality. While components like retrieval-augmented generation, self-consistency, and graph-based reasoning exist independently, the proposed synthesis is innovative. Specifically, constructing an 'Evidence Graph' directly from LLM-generated citations within a self-consistency framework, and then using graph-theoretic properties (coherence metrics) to score and select hypotheses, represents a fresh approach to evidence aggregation and verification for LLM truthfulness. It moves beyond simple voting or basic RAG."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but presents significant implementation challenges. Standard retrieval and LLM prompting for hypotheses are achievable. However, reliably extracting structured claims and their relations from text to build an accurate 'Evidence Graph' is non-trivial and likely prone to noise. Furthermore, the proposed reinforcement learning step to fine-tune the LLM based on graph coherence metrics is computationally expensive and complex to implement effectively. While conceptually sound, realizing the full pipeline requires considerable engineering effort and overcoming potential robustness issues in graph construction."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Addressing LLM hallucinations and improving truthfulness is a critical challenge for widespread adoption and trust, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law mentioned in the motivation. Providing transparent, evidence-backed explanations via the proposed graph structure directly tackles the need for interpretability. Success in this research could lead to major advancements in building more reliable and trustworthy LLM applications."
