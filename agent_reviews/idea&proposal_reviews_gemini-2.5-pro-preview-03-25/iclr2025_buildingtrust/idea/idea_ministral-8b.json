    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly consistent with the task description. The workshop explicitly calls for submissions on 'Explainability and interpretability of language model responses' (point 3 in the scope) and focuses on the overarching theme of 'Building Trust in Language Models and Applications'. The idea directly addresses this by proposing an XAI framework to enhance LLM explainability specifically to improve trustworthiness, aligning perfectly with the workshop's goals and scope."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is mostly clear and well-articulated. It clearly states the motivation (trustworthiness concerns), the main goal (develop an XAI framework for LLMs), and the general methodology (using LIME, SHAP, attention; evaluating with metrics and user studies). The expected outcomes and potential impact are also clearly defined. Minor ambiguity exists regarding the specific novelty of the proposed 'framework' beyond applying known techniques, and the rationale for using BLEU/ROUGE as interpretability metrics could be slightly clearer (perhaps they relate to the quality of generated textual explanations or ensuring fidelity)."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The idea has satisfactory novelty. Applying established XAI techniques like LIME, SHAP, and attention mechanisms to LLMs is a common and active research area, not inherently novel. The proposal doesn't clearly articulate a groundbreaking technique or a fundamentally new approach to explainability itself. The novelty might lie in the specific design of the integrated 'framework', the combination of methods, or the rigorous focus on linking explanations to user trust via empirical studies, but this is not explicitly detailed. It seems more focused on applying and evaluating existing methods within the specific context of trust, rather than inventing entirely new methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible. The proposed XAI techniques (LIME, SHAP, attention analysis) are established, although applying some (like LIME/SHAP) to very large models can be computationally intensive but is still achievable. Access to LLMs, relevant datasets, and computational resources are standard requirements in ML research. Conducting user studies adds logistical complexity but is a standard methodology in HCI and AI evaluation. The overall plan uses existing, implementable techniques and evaluation methods."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea is highly significant and impactful. Enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs is a critical challenge given their widespread adoption. Explainability is widely recognized as a key component of trustworthy AI. Developing frameworks and methods to improve LLM interpretability can lead to better user understanding, easier debugging, identification of biases, increased user trust, and more responsible deployment in critical applications. This directly addresses a major bottleneck in the field and aligns with the workshop's emphasis on trust."
