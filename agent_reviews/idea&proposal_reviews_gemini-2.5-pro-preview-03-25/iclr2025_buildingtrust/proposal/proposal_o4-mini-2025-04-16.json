    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (workshop on trust in LLMs, focusing on reliability, error detection/correction), the research idea (self-correction via confidence scoring and retrieval), and the literature review (building on existing self-correction work while addressing identified challenges). It directly targets key themes of the workshop scope, such as improving truthfulness and error detection/correction. The methodology clearly operationalizes the core research idea, and the expected outcomes directly relate to enhancing trustworthiness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-defined. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides a detailed overview, pseudo-code, component descriptions (confidence scoring, retrieval), and a thorough experimental plan. The structure is logical. Minor ambiguities exist, such as the precise mechanism for query encoding from spans and the exact prompt structure for the correction step, but overall, the proposal is well-articulated and understandable."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While concepts like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and self-correction exist (as shown in the literature review), the specific combination of an *iterative* loop driven by an *internal confidence scorer* (combining token entropy and attention variance) for targeted retrieval-augmented correction appears novel. It distinguishes itself from prior work focusing on fine-tuning for self-correction or using teacher models. The novelty lies in the integrated framework and the specific confidence mechanism proposed, though it builds upon established techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It rests on solid theoretical foundations (uncertainty quantification, RAG, iterative methods). The methodology is logical, detailing the steps from generation to correction. The confidence scoring metric, combining entropy and attention variance, is plausible, although its effectiveness and the weighting parameter require empirical validation. The experimental design is comprehensive, including relevant benchmarks, baselines, metrics, and ablations. The formalization of the loop (Sec 2.5) is conceptually sound but could be more mathematically rigorous regarding convergence or error bounds."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible. It leverages existing open-source LLMs (LLaMA-2), standard datasets (FEVER, TruthfulQA), and established tools (Faiss, LoRA). The required computational resources (A100 GPUs) are typical for LLM research. The methodology involves implementable steps (fine-tuning, retrieval setup, confidence calculation). The main risks involve achieving the ambitious performance targets (30-50% reduction, <2x latency) and ensuring the reliability of the confidence scorer, but the core research plan is practical."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem: the lack of trustworthiness and prevalence of hallucinations in LLMs, which is a major barrier to their adoption in critical domains (as highlighted in the task description and motivation). Successfully developing an automated, efficient self-correction mechanism like IS-LLM would be a major advancement, potentially leading to substantially more reliable LLMs, reducing human verification costs, and fostering user trust. The potential impact on real-world applications and research synergies is substantial."
