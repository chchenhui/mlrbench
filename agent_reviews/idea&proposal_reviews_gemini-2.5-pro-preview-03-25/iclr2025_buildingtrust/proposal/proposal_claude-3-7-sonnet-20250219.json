        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description (Workshop on Building Trust in LLMs), the research idea (Self-Correcting LLMs), and the literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on reliability, truthfulness, error detection, and correction (Scope points 2 and 8). The methodology elaborates precisely on the research idea's core components (internal confidence scoring, retrieval-augmented correction). Furthermore, it acknowledges and aims to tackle challenges identified in the literature review, such as error detection accuracy and computational overhead, positioning itself within the current research landscape."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is mostly clear and well-articulated. The objectives, methodology components (confidence scoring, retrieval, iteration), experimental design, and evaluation metrics are presented logically and are generally easy to understand. Mathematical formulations for confidence signals are provided. However, some implementation details could be more specific, such as how the confidence score aggregation weights (\\\\\\\\alpha, \\\\\\\\beta, \\\\\\\\gamma, \\\\\\\\delta) are learned or optimized, the precise nature of the `Contextualize` function, and the exact prompting strategy for the correction LLM. Despite these minor points needing refinement, the overall proposal is well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality. While individual components like uncertainty estimation (using attention, probabilities), contrastive decoding, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and self-correction exist in the literature (as shown in the review), the novelty lies in their specific integration. The proposed framework combines multiple *internal* uncertainty signals to trigger *targeted* retrieval-augmented correction within an *iterative* refinement loop during inference. This differs from standard RAG (often applied upfront or uniformly), post-hoc correction systems, or self-correction methods relying solely on fine-tuning or teacher models (like SuperCorrect or ISC). The synergistic combination of these elements for dynamic self-correction presents a fresh perspective."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is sound and mostly rigorous. It builds upon established concepts: uncertainty quantification in LLMs (using probabilities, attention patterns), contrastive methods for consistency checking, and retrieval augmentation for grounding. The methodology is logical, breaking down the problem into distinct, addressable components. The technical formulations for individual signals are clear. The iterative refinement process is a reasonable approach to progressive improvement. Minor weaknesses include the simplicity of the linear aggregation for the confidence score (which might need a more sophisticated approach) and the implicit assumption that the chosen signals reliably indicate correctable errors across diverse contexts. The lack of detail on learning the aggregation weights is also a minor gap."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Implementing attention analysis, probability extraction, contrastive decoding (though computationally intensive), retrieval systems, and LLM-based correction is achievable. The required datasets for evaluation are standard benchmarks. However, integrating these components into an efficient iterative loop poses engineering challenges. Managing the computational overhead and latency introduced by contrastive decoding, multiple retrieval calls, and iterative generation steps is crucial for practical deployment, as acknowledged. Obtaining or creating suitable data to train the confidence score weights might require additional effort. The overall plan is realistic for a research project but faces practical hurdles for real-time application without significant optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly significant and impactful. It tackles the critical issue of LLM trustworthiness and hallucination, a major bottleneck for their adoption in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and law, aligning perfectly with the workshop's theme. Successfully developing a robust self-correction mechanism could lead to major advancements in AI reliability, reduce the burden of human verification, and enable safer deployment of LLMs. The potential to transform LLMs into self-improving systems represents a substantial contribution to the field."
