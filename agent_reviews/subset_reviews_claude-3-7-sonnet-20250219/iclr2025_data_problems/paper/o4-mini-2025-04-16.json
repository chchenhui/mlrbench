    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper demonstrates strong consistency between the task description, research idea, proposal, and experimental results. The core concept of hierarchical influence-driven curation for multi-modal foundation models is maintained throughout all sections. The methodology follows the proposed two-stage pipeline: clustering image-text pairs and estimating influence scores for principled pruning. The experimental results align with the proposed approach, showing data reduction while maintaining competitive performance. There are minor inconsistencies in the experimental setup - the paper mentions using MS COCO, Visual Genome, and Conceptual Captions in the proposal, but only reports results on MS COCO. Additionally, the relative training time in the results table shows 0.71× for InfluenceSpace, but the analysis section correctly references this value."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to results. The technical content is presented with appropriate mathematical notation and algorithm descriptions. The methodology section clearly explains the three-stage pipeline with sufficient detail on cross-modal embedding, influence estimation, and pruning/reweighting. However, there are some clarity issues: the paper could benefit from more explicit definitions of some terms (e.g., what constitutes 'harmful' vs. 'beneficial' clusters beyond just the influence score sign). The results section would be clearer with more detailed explanations of the evaluation metrics and how fairness improvements were measured. Some figures or diagrams illustrating the clustering process or influence distribution would have enhanced clarity significantly."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper covers the essential components of the research, including background, methodology, experiments, and analysis. However, several important elements are missing or underdeveloped. The fairness improvements are mentioned but not quantitatively reported in the main results table. The paper states a 15% reduction in performance gaps across demographic subgroups but notes these are 'not shown' without providing the actual data. The experimental results section lacks detailed ablation studies that were promised in the proposal. While the paper mentions using MS COCO, it doesn't specify which subset was used or its size. The implementation details are sparse - for example, the specific model architecture used for the retrieval task is not described. Additionally, the paper mentions an iterative loop in the methodology but doesn't clearly report how many iterations were actually performed in the experiments."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper presents a theoretically sound approach to data curation using influence functions and clustering. However, there are significant concerns about the experimental validation. The reported results show that InfluenceSpace achieves a substantial drop in Recall@1 (10.00 vs. 32.50 for the full dataset), which is a major performance degradation despite the paper framing the results as 'competitive.' The paper acknowledges this limitation but doesn't provide sufficient analysis of why this occurs or how it might be addressed. The fairness improvements are claimed but not substantiated with actual data. The experimental setup uses only 5 clusters, which seems insufficient for the proposed method (the proposal suggested K≈10^3). The paper also lacks statistical significance testing or confidence intervals for the reported metrics. Additionally, the evaluation is limited to a single dataset (MS COCO subset) rather than the multiple datasets proposed."

        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper presents an innovative approach to data curation for multi-modal foundation models with a solid theoretical foundation. The hierarchical influence-driven method addresses an important problem in the field of data-centric AI. However, the experimental validation has significant limitations, including the substantial performance drop in key metrics and incomplete reporting of results. The paper would benefit from more comprehensive experiments, better analysis of trade-offs, and clearer presentation of fairness improvements.",
