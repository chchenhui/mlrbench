    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The paper demonstrates excellent consistency between the task description, research idea, research proposal, and experimental results. The paper addresses the challenge of spurious correlations in machine learning as outlined in the task description, and implements the proposed AIFS method exactly as described in the research idea and proposal. The experimental results directly validate the claims made in the introduction and methodology sections, showing that AIFS improves worst-group accuracy by 18.17% compared to standard ERM while maintaining competitive overall performance. The paper consistently emphasizes the ability to discover and neutralize spurious correlations without requiring group annotations throughout all sections. The mathematical formulations, algorithmic descriptions, and experimental setup all align perfectly with the core concept of using synthetic interventions in latent space to mitigate reliance on spurious features."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is written with strong clarity and follows a logical structure that makes it easy to follow. The abstract concisely summarizes the problem, approach, and results. The introduction clearly establishes the problem of spurious correlations and motivates the proposed solution. The related work section comprehensively covers relevant literature and positions the current work appropriately. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the AIFS framework, including mathematical formulations that are well-defined. The experimental results are presented clearly with appropriate tables and figures that support the claims. The discussion section thoughtfully analyzes the findings and acknowledges limitations. The only minor issues affecting clarity are some technical explanations in Section 3.2 that could benefit from additional examples to illustrate the intervention mechanism, and the mathematical notation in some equations could be more explicitly defined for readers less familiar with the field."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is quite comprehensive in addressing all components of the research. It thoroughly explains the problem of spurious correlations, reviews relevant literature, details the proposed AIFS methodology, and presents experimental results that validate the approach. The methodology section is particularly complete, covering the problem formulation, framework components, latent space interventions, dual-objective loss, gradient-based attribution, and training algorithm. The experimental section includes multiple datasets, baseline comparisons, and various evaluation metrics including overall accuracy, worst-group accuracy, and disparity measures. The paper also includes ablation studies to analyze the contribution of different components of AIFS. However, there are a few areas where additional details would strengthen completeness: (1) more specific information about hyperparameter selection and sensitivity analysis, (2) more detailed explanation of the implementation of the intervention module, and (3) additional qualitative examples showing how AIFS identifies and neutralizes specific spurious features in the datasets used."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a sound methodology with reasonable arguments and experimental validation. The theoretical foundation of using interventions in latent space to discover and neutralize spurious correlations is well-motivated and builds upon established concepts in causal learning. The experimental design comparing AIFS against multiple baselines (ERM, Group DRO, DANN, Reweighting) on benchmark datasets is appropriate for validating the claims. The results show significant improvements in worst-group accuracy and reduced disparity, supporting the effectiveness of the approach. The ablation studies further strengthen the soundness by isolating the contributions of different components. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) the paper lacks statistical significance testing for the reported improvements, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the method are not fully developed, (3) the experiments are limited to a few datasets, raising questions about generalizability across different domains, and (4) while the paper claims AIFS can automatically discover spurious features, there is limited analysis showing what specific spurious features were identified in the experiments and how they align with known biases in the datasets."
