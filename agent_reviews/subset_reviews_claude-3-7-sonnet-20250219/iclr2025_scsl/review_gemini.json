        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written with a clear structure that follows a logical flow from introduction to conclusion. The authors effectively articulate the problem of spurious correlations and the need for automated discovery methods. The LASS framework is explained in a step-by-step manner with detailed descriptions of each phase. However, there are some clarity issues: the experimental results section contains inconsistencies between the text and figures (e.g., claiming improvements while showing identical performance metrics), and the analysis section acknowledges 0.00% improvements but still suggests the framework was successful. The methodology is well-described, but the actual implementation details of how LLM hypotheses translate to model improvements could be more explicit."

        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel approach to discovering unknown spurious correlations using LLMs as hypothesis generators. This integration of LLMs into the robustness pipeline is innovative and addresses a real gap in current methods that require pre-defined knowledge of spurious attributes. However, the core techniques used for mitigation (reweighting, auxiliary tasks) are standard approaches borrowed from existing literature. The paper builds upon and combines existing ideas rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical insights. The LLM-driven discovery component is the main novel contribution, but even this adapts existing LLM capabilities rather than developing new ones."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper has significant soundness issues. The experimental results show that both the ERM baseline and LASS models achieve identical performance (1.000 accuracy across all metrics), indicating that either the synthetic dataset was too simple or the experiments were flawed. The paper claims 'The LLM successfully generated relevant hypotheses regarding the underlying spurious correlation' but then shows a hypothesis about 'color variations' when the known spurious feature was background type. The analysis section acknowledges 0.00% improvement but still frames the approach as promising without adequate evidence. The code implementation appears functional, but the experiments fail to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Most critically, the figures show that both models achieve perfect accuracy on all groups (including minority groups) and on OOD data, which contradicts the expected behavior of models affected by spurious correlations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The problem being addressed is significant - discovering unknown spurious correlations without manual annotation is an important challenge in machine learning robustness. If successful, such an approach could have broad impact across many applications of AI. However, the paper's actual contribution to solving this problem is limited by the experimental shortcomings. The framework is conceptually interesting but lacks convincing empirical validation. The paper identifies an important direction for research but doesn't demonstrate substantial progress beyond the conceptual framework. The potential significance is high, but the realized significance based on the presented results is modest."
