        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is well-written and structured in a logical manner. The authors clearly articulate their contributions, methodology, and experimental setup. The introduction effectively frames the problem of spurious correlations and motivates the need for SpurGen. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the data generation process, evaluation metrics (SSS and IG), and robustification baselines. The figures and tables are informative and support the text well. However, there are some areas that could be improved: (1) The mathematical formulations, while present, could benefit from more detailed explanations, particularly for the Invariance Gap metric; (2) The analysis section could provide deeper insights into why IRM shifts reliance from background texture to shape; (3) Some terms like 'spurious channels' are used before being fully defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents several novel contributions: (1) SpurGen, a synthetic multimodal benchmark with configurable spurious correlations across different channels; (2) Two new evaluation metrics (Spurious Sensitivity Score and Invariance Gap) that quantify model reliance on spurious features; (3) A modular approach to generating paired examples with controlled spurious attributes. While synthetic datasets for studying spurious correlations exist (e.g., Colored MNIST), SpurGen extends this concept to multimodal data with multiple orthogonal spurious channels and provides greater control over spurious alignment strength. However, the robustification methods evaluated (ERM and IRM) are not novel, and the experimental findings largely confirm known trade-offs between accuracy and invariance rather than revealing fundamentally new insights about spurious correlations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper's methodology is generally sound, but there are several concerns: (1) The experimental evaluation is limited to only two methods (ERM and IRM) despite mentioning five baseline approaches; (2) The dataset size is quite small (300 samples), raising questions about statistical significance; (3) Both methods achieve 0.0% worst-group accuracy, which suggests fundamental limitations in the experimental setup or methods; (4) The validation process for the proposed metrics (SSS and IG) is not thoroughly described; (5) The diverging validation loss curves in Figures 2a and 2b suggest potential overfitting issues that are not addressed in the analysis; (6) The paper mentions multimodal capabilities but experiments only on image data, not demonstrating the text modality in practice. While the mathematical formulations appear correct, the limited scope of experiments and small dataset size weaken the soundness of the conclusions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem in machine learning: detecting and mitigating spurious correlations. The proposed SpurGen benchmark could be a valuable tool for researchers studying robustness and generalization. The ability to systematically control spurious correlations across multiple channels and modalities enables more rigorous evaluation of robustification methods than is possible with naturally occurring datasets. The proposed metrics (SSS and IG) provide quantitative measures of spurious reliance that could be adopted by the community. However, the significance is somewhat limited by: (1) The focus on synthetic rather than real-world data; (2) The preliminary nature of the experiments (small dataset, only two methods evaluated); (3) The lack of demonstration of the multimodal capabilities in practice. The paper represents a solid contribution to the field but would benefit from more extensive experimentation to demonstrate its full potential."
