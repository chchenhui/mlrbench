        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written with a clear structure that follows a logical flow from problem statement to methodology, experiments, and analysis. The core SCEC approach is explained with mathematical formulations that are accessible, particularly the uncertainty scoring formula (u_t = α·u^var_t + (1-α)·[1 - (1/k)·∑_{i=1}^k s^{(i)}_t]) and the hallucination penalty for decoding. The figures effectively illustrate key results, such as the QA performance comparison and ablation studies. However, there are some areas that could be clearer: the paper doesn't fully explain how token-level uncertainty is mapped to segment-level claims for evidence retrieval, and the distinction between the variance component and evidence component could be elaborated further with concrete examples."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel combination of self-consistency sampling and external evidence verification for uncertainty quantification in LLMs. While neither self-consistency nor evidence retrieval is entirely new, the integration of these approaches into a unified framework with a weighted combination (controlled by α) represents an innovative contribution. The dynamic hallucination penalty during decoding (controlled by β) is also a valuable addition to the literature. The paper acknowledges prior work appropriately, positioning SCEC as an advancement over existing methods like Semantic Entropy Probes (SEP) and Uncertainty-Aware Fusion (UAF). However, the core techniques build upon established methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms, and the evidence retrieval component uses standard approaches like BM25 retrieval and entailment scoring."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper's methodology is generally sound, with appropriate experimental design and evaluation metrics. However, several issues affect its soundness: (1) The experiments are conducted on synthetic QA data rather than standard benchmarks, raising questions about generalizability; (2) The paper mentions summarization experiments as future work but presents them as if they were completed in some sections; (3) The code implementation shows placeholder visualizations rather than actual experimental results, suggesting the figures may be simulated rather than derived from real experiments; (4) The ablation studies are thorough in concept but appear to be based on limited data (subset_size = min(10, len(examples))); (5) The paper doesn't adequately address potential biases in the evidence retrieval component or how the system handles conflicting evidence. While the mathematical formulation is sound, the empirical validation has significant limitations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper addresses the critical problem of uncertainty quantification and hallucination detection in LLMs, which is highly relevant for deploying these models in high-stakes domains. The reported improvements are substantial: reducing ECE from 0.187 to 0.102 and improving F1 from 0.889 to 0.923 on synthetic Natural Questions. The approach is practical as it doesn't require model retraining and can be applied to black-box LLMs through API interfaces. The ablation studies provide useful insights about parameter sensitivity. However, the significance is limited by: (1) Testing only on synthetic data rather than established benchmarks; (2) Limited evaluation of real-world applicability; (3) Lack of comparison with some recent strong baselines; (4) Unclear scalability to very large documents or complex queries. The method shows promise but needs more extensive validation on diverse, real-world datasets."
