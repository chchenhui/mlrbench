        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written with a clear structure that follows standard research paper organization. The authors effectively articulate the problem of hallucination in LLMs and present their proposed solution (AUG-RAG) in a logical manner. Key concepts like uncertainty quantification and adaptive retrieval are explained adequately. However, there are some areas that could be improved: (1) The methodology section lacks sufficient detail on how uncertainty is actually calculated for API-based models like GPT-4o-mini; (2) The experimental setup is somewhat vague about how self-contradiction rates were measured; (3) The results section contains many 'N/A' values, making it difficult to fully understand the comparative performance across all metrics."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The core idea of using uncertainty estimation to trigger retrieval selectively is a reasonable innovation that combines existing techniques in a new way. The paper builds upon established work in uncertainty quantification and retrieval-augmented generation. However, the novelty is incremental rather than groundbreaking. The concept of adaptive retrieval based on model confidence has been explored in other contexts, and the uncertainty estimation methods used (entropy, MC dropout) are standard approaches. The paper does not introduce fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks, but rather applies existing techniques to the specific problem of hallucination mitigation in a selective retrieval framework."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper has significant methodological and experimental weaknesses: (1) The experiments are extremely limited in scale, with only 6 samples evaluated according to Table 1, which is far too small for meaningful conclusions; (2) The paper acknowledges that 'Full AUG-RAG results could not be obtained due to time limitations,' indicating incomplete evaluation; (3) The code reveals implementation issues, with run logs showing errors like 'APIBasedModel object has no attribute tokenizer' when trying to run AUG-RAG experiments; (4) The results in Figure 1 appear to be projections rather than actual experimental results, as suggested by the code and run logs; (5) The paper reports 0% 'Truthful Response' for both baseline and standard RAG, raising questions about the evaluation methodology; (6) The implementation of uncertainty estimation for API-based models in the code uses heuristics rather than actual model uncertainty when token probabilities aren't available."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The problem being addressed—hallucination mitigation in LLMs—is certainly important and relevant to the field. The proposed approach of selectively triggering retrieval based on uncertainty could potentially improve both computational efficiency and output quality. However, the significance is limited by: (1) The extremely small-scale evaluation that prevents drawing robust conclusions; (2) The lack of complete results across all proposed metrics and models; (3) The absence of human evaluation to verify actual hallucination reduction; (4) The limited improvement shown in the preliminary results (reduction in self-contradiction rate from 0.17 to 0.11-0.12); (5) The fact that the computational savings from reduced retrieval frequency might be offset by the overhead of uncertainty estimation, which isn't analyzed in the paper."

    "Overall": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "While the paper presents an interesting approach to hallucination mitigation through adaptive retrieval, the severe limitations in experimental validation, incomplete results, and evidence from the code that some results may be projected rather than experimentally verified significantly undermine its credibility. The core idea has merit, but the execution and evaluation fall short of the standards expected for a rigorous research contribution.",
