        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written with a clear structure that follows standard scientific paper organization. The authors clearly articulate the problem of uncertainty quantification in LLMs and present their two-stage approach in a logical manner. The methodology section provides mathematical formulations that help understand the proposed approach. However, there are some areas that could be improved: (1) The abstract is somewhat dense and could better highlight the key contributions; (2) The explanation of the certainty gate network could be more detailed, particularly regarding its architecture; (3) The experimental section is limited to a preliminary study on SST-2 rather than a full evaluation of the proposed UQ framework, making it difficult to assess the complete method."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper presents a somewhat novel approach to uncertainty quantification in LLMs through a two-stage framework combining a certainty gate with targeted MC dropout. The adaptive computation aspect, where expensive MC sampling is only applied to uncertain tokens, is an interesting contribution. However, the novelty is limited by several factors: (1) The core techniques (MC dropout, temperature scaling) are well-established in the literature; (2) The paper primarily combines existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques; (3) The related work section shows several recent approaches to UQ in LLMs, and the paper doesn't clearly differentiate its approach from these existing methods; (4) The experimental validation is limited to a preliminary study on head training strategies rather than demonstrating the effectiveness of the complete framework."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper has several methodological issues that raise concerns about its soundness: (1) The experimental evaluation is extremely limited - it only tests head training strategies on a small subset of SST-2 (200 train, 100 validation examples) rather than evaluating the complete UQ framework; (2) The paper claims the method will achieve 'ensemble-level calibration (ECE <2%)' and 'robust hallucination detection (F1 >0.8)' but provides no experimental evidence to support these claims; (3) The code provided shows that the experiments only compare full fine-tuning vs. head-only fine-tuning on a sentiment classification task, which doesn't evaluate the proposed UQ framework at all; (4) The paper lacks ablation studies or comparisons with baseline UQ methods; (5) The figures in the paper match those generated by the code, but they only show training curves for the preliminary study, not results for the proposed UQ method."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The problem of uncertainty quantification in LLMs is certainly significant and timely, as highlighted in the introduction. The proposed approach of using a lightweight gate to selectively apply MC dropout could potentially reduce computational costs while maintaining calibration quality, which would be valuable for real-time applications. However, the significance is limited by: (1) The lack of comprehensive evaluation on standard UQ benchmarks; (2) No demonstration of the claimed 60% reduction in inference compute; (3) No evaluation on hallucination detection tasks; (4) The preliminary study on SST-2 doesn't demonstrate the method's effectiveness for the stated goals; (5) The paper positions much of the actual evaluation as 'future work' rather than providing concrete results."
