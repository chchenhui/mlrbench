    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The paper demonstrates excellent consistency between the task description, research idea, research proposal, and experimental results. The paper directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable optimization for efficient and adaptive foundation models, particularly in the context of long-context understanding and efficient adaptation. The proposed DSRSQ framework consistently implements the three key components outlined in the research idea: dynamic sparse retrieval, sub-quadratic sparse attention, and rotating compressive KV cache. The methodology section thoroughly elaborates on these components, and the experimental results validate their effectiveness. The paper shows strong internal consistency, with the abstract promising specific memory and FLOP reductions (70-85% and 50-70% respectively) that are then confirmed in the experimental results section (showing memory reduction from 2970MB to 1297MB, approximately 56%). The ablation studies further reinforce consistency by demonstrating how each component contributes to the overall performance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The abstract effectively summarizes the key contributions and findings. The introduction clearly establishes the problem context and outlines the proposed approach. The methodology section is particularly strong, with detailed explanations of each component (DSR, SQA, RCKV) including mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The experimental results are presented in a systematic manner with appropriate tables and visualizations that support the claims made. The paper uses consistent terminology throughout and maintains a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to results. However, there are a few areas where clarity could be improved: some mathematical notations in Section 3.2 and 3.3 could benefit from more explanation (e.g., the relationship between complexity(q) and the dynamic budget), and the discussion of the hybrid optimization framework could provide more details on how the different loss components interact during training."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper comprehensively addresses the task of developing efficient long-context models as outlined in the workshop description. It covers all essential components of a research paper: problem statement, related work, methodology, experiments, results, and analysis. The methodology section is particularly complete, detailing each component of the proposed DSRSQ framework with mathematical formulations and algorithmic descriptions. The experimental section includes a wide range of evaluations across multiple datasets and comparison with relevant baselines. The ablation studies effectively isolate the contribution of each component. The paper also addresses limitations and future work directions. However, there are a few areas where additional details would enhance completeness: more information on the implementation details of the reinforcement learning training process for the DSR component, more extensive discussion of the hyperparameter selection process, and more detailed analysis of failure cases or scenarios where the approach might not perform optimally."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a methodologically sound approach to addressing the challenge of efficient long-context processing. The theoretical foundations for each component are well-established, drawing on principles from information retrieval, sparse attention mechanisms, and low-rank approximations. The experimental design is appropriate, with relevant baselines and metrics that capture both task performance and efficiency aspects. The results demonstrate clear improvements over baseline approaches across multiple metrics. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contribution of each component. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) The paper claims sub-quadratic complexity but doesn't provide a rigorous complexity analysis to prove the O(n log n) claim; (2) The evaluation focuses primarily on Natural Questions dataset, with other datasets mentioned but results not fully presented; (3) While the paper mentions training with PPO for the retriever, it doesn't provide sufficient details on how this training was implemented or converged; (4) Some of the performance improvements seem unusually large compared to established baselines (e.g., 0.8478 F1 vs 0.8149 for standard models), raising questions about whether the comparison is fully fair."
