        "justification": "The paper is well-written and structured in a logical manner. The authors clearly articulate their proposed approach (PRo-MoE), its motivation, and the technical details. The methodology section provides a comprehensive explanation of the architecture, including mathematical formulations that help understand the model. The figures showing loss curves are clear and properly labeled. However, there are some minor issues: Section 6 appears to be missing from the paper, and the transition from experimental results to analysis could be smoother. Additionally, some technical concepts could benefit from more intuitive explanations for broader accessibility."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper introduces a novel concept of proactive routing in MoE models based on task descriptions, which represents a meaningful extension to existing MoE architectures. The idea of using a meta-network to generate task-specific routing policies without gradient updates is innovative and addresses a real limitation in current MoE models. The authors position their work well within the existing literature, citing relevant recent work. However, the core mechanism (using a hypernetwork to generate parameters) builds upon established meta-learning techniques, and the paper acknowledges that similar approaches have been explored in adjacent areas like parameter-efficient fine-tuning and adaptive routing, though not specifically for zero-shot task adaptation in MoE models."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper has several methodological issues that affect its soundness. First, the experimental setup is extremely limited - using only a single dataset (BoolQ) with a small subset of data and only one epoch of training. This is insufficient to validate the claims about zero-shot task adaptation. Second, the results contradict the paper's hypothesis, as the standard MoE outperforms the proposed PRo-MoE model (10.38 vs 17.68 evaluation loss). While the authors acknowledge these limitations, they represent a fundamental weakness in the empirical validation. The code implementation matches the described methodology, but the experimental design doesn't adequately test the core hypothesis about multi-task generalization. The figures appear to be based on real experimental results, but they show only single data points rather than complete learning curves, limiting their informativeness."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem in the field of efficient and adaptive foundation models. If successful, the proposed approach could enable more efficient adaptation of MoE models to new tasks without fine-tuning, which would be valuable for deployment scenarios. The theoretical contribution is significant in proposing a new paradigm for task-level conditioning in MoE models. However, the actual impact is limited by the preliminary nature of the results, which fail to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors clearly outline future work that would be needed to fully validate their approach, but as presented, the significance is more in the conceptual contribution than in demonstrated practical impact. The reproducibility is good, with code that matches the paper's description."

While the clarity of presentation and theoretical foundation are strong, the empirical evidence is insufficient to justify the paper's conclusions.",
