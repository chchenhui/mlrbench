        "justification": "The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates its contributions. The methodology is explained in a logical sequence with Algorithm 1 formalizing the pipeline. The DSL for function contracts is presented with a clear BNF and examples. Figures and tables effectively illustrate the results. However, some technical details about the counterexample-to-feedback translation could be more thoroughly explained, and the paper would benefit from more examples of how the feedback mechanism works in practice."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel integration of formal specifications with LLM code generation in a closed-loop system. The key innovation is the natural language feedback mechanism that translates counterexamples from failed proofs back to the LLM. While individual components (LLMs for code generation, formal verification) are not new, the complete 'spec-generate-verify-refine' cycle with automated feedback translation represents an incremental but meaningful advance over existing approaches like VeCoGen and LLM4Code, which the authors appropriately cite and compare against."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "There are significant concerns about the soundness of the experimental results. The provided code reveals that the experiments were not actually run with real LLM interactions but were simulated with mock data. The run_minimal.py script generates random success rates and metrics rather than performing actual verification. While the methodology described in the paper is theoretically sound, the implementation in the code does not match what's claimed in the paper. The paper presents results as if they were obtained from real experiments, but the code shows they were artificially generated. This raises serious questions about the validity of the reported 100% success rate and other metrics."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The problem addressed is important - improving the correctness of LLM-generated code through formal verification. The approach of using lightweight specifications and automated feedback loops could potentially make formal methods more accessible to developers. However, the significance is undermined by the questionable experimental results. If the approach works as described, it would represent a meaningful contribution to the field of AI-assisted software engineering, but without reliable empirical evidence, its practical impact remains uncertain. The benchmark suite covering both algorithmic and systems tasks is comprehensive, which is a positive aspect."
