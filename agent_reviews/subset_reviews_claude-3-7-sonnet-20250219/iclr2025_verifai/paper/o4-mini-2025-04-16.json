        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper shows significant inconsistencies between the claimed contributions and the reported results. The research idea and proposal promised a 50% reduction in manual tactic writing, but the experimental results show only a 0.08% reduction. The paper claims LLM-TAC outperforms baselines, yet the results table shows identical performance (0.00 tactic accuracy, 1.00 proof completion rate) across LLM-TAC, Na√Øve LLM, and In-Context Learning. The figures contradict the tables - e.g., Figure 4 (RL progression) shows flat lines near zero for all metrics despite claims that RL significantly improves performance. The paper states that both retrieval and RL components are 'critical' but the ablation study shows identical performance with or without these components."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper is generally well-structured with clear sections following a standard research paper format. The methodology is explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, and the experimental setup is described adequately. Figures are included to visualize results, which is helpful. However, there are clarity issues in the results section where the narrative doesn't match the data presented in tables and figures. The paper claims improvements and benefits that aren't reflected in the numerical results. Additionally, the interpretation of results in Section 6 (Analysis) attempts to explain away contradictions rather than addressing them directly, which reduces clarity. The mathematical notation is consistent, but the explanation of what the 0.00 tactic accuracy actually means is inadequate."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper covers the essential components expected in a research paper: introduction, related work, methodology, experiments, results, and analysis. It addresses the task of using LLMs for theorem proving as outlined in the task description. However, there are significant gaps in completeness. The experimental results section lacks detailed explanation of the evaluation metrics - particularly why tactic accuracy is 0.00 across all methods. The paper doesn't adequately explain why the reduction in manual writing (0.08%) falls so far short of the expected outcome (50%) mentioned in the research idea. The ablation study is superficial, showing identical results across all configurations without explaining this unexpected outcome. The paper also lacks error analysis or discussion of statistical significance, and doesn't provide sufficient details about the dataset composition or model training parameters."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper has major soundness issues. The experimental results contradict the claims made throughout the paper. The identical performance metrics across different methods (including ablations) suggest either implementation errors or evaluation problems. The 0.00 tactic accuracy across all methods is particularly concerning and unexplained. The paper claims that 'LLM-TAC attains perfect proof completion (100%) across tested domains,' but this identical performance with the baseline methods undermines the contribution claim. The figures showing learning curves and RL progression appear disconnected from the tabular results. The paper attempts to frame the 0.08% reduction in manual writing as a success despite being orders of magnitude below the 50% target. The methodology itself appears theoretically sound, but the experimental validation is fundamentally flawed, making it impossible to assess whether the approach actually works as described."
