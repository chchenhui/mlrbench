    "Consistency": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper shows moderate consistency between its components and with the original research idea. The core concept of using LLMs for tactic generation in interactive theorem provers is maintained throughout. However, there are notable inconsistencies: (1) The experimental results report a 0.08% reduction in manual tactic writing, which falls far short of the 50% reduction claimed in both the research idea and proposal; (2) The paper claims significant contributions from RL and retrieval components, but the ablation studies show identical performance metrics with or without these components; (3) The tactic accuracy is reported as 0.00% for LLM-TAC while achieving 100% proof completion rate, which is contradictory and unexplained; (4) The completion times of 0.00s in Table 1 contradict the non-zero times shown in Figure 2."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written and structured in a logical manner. The methodology is clearly explained with appropriate formalization of the approach. The three-stage framework (contextual encoding, tactic generation & verification, and reinforcement loop) is consistently presented throughout the paper. Figures and tables are used effectively to present results. The writing is technically precise and the flow from introduction through methodology to results and analysis is coherent. However, there are some clarity issues: (1) The contradictory results regarding tactic accuracy and proof completion are not adequately explained; (2) The interpretation of the 0.08% reduction in manual writing is unclear; (3) The paper doesn't clearly explain why the ablation studies show no difference in performance metrics."

    "Completeness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper covers most essential components expected in a research paper on this topic. It includes a comprehensive introduction, related work section, detailed methodology, experiment setup, results, analysis, and conclusion. The methodology section thoroughly explains the three-stage framework. However, there are some completeness issues: (1) The paper mentions benchmarking against standard Coq libraries like mathcomp and stdlib, but the actual benchmarks used are not clearly specified; (2) The experimental results section lacks details on the dataset size, complexity of theorems tested, and statistical significance of findings; (3) The paper acknowledges but doesn't fully explain the contradictory results regarding tactic accuracy and proof completion; (4) The paper doesn't provide sufficient details on the LLM architecture, training data, or hyperparameters used in the experiments."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The paper has several methodological and analytical issues that undermine its soundness: (1) The reported 0.08% reduction in manual tactic writing is drastically lower than the 50% target, yet this discrepancy is not adequately addressed; (2) The tactic accuracy of 0.00% alongside 100% proof completion rate is paradoxical and unexplained; (3) The ablation studies show no difference in performance when key components are removed, contradicting claims about their importance; (4) The completion times of 0.00s in Table 1 are implausible and inconsistent with Figure 2; (5) The RL progression graph (Figure 4) shows minimal changes, suggesting the RL component may not be functioning as described; (6) The paper lacks statistical analysis or significance testing for the reported results; (7) The benchmark complexity is not adequately characterized, making it difficult to assess the generalizability of the findings."
