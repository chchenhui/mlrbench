        "justification": "The paper is well-structured and generally well-written, with clear organization into standard sections. The authors effectively articulate the problem of disconnection between verification and learning in code generation models. The methodology is explained in detail with four well-defined components (CFT, VIL, E2EC, and RIL), and the mathematical formulations help clarify the approach. Figures and tables are appropriately used to illustrate results. However, there are some areas that could be improved: the explanation of the error-to-explanation conversion process could be more concrete with specific examples, and some technical details about how the verification feedback is incorporated into the learning process could be clearer."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel framework that bridges verification and learning in a closed-loop system. While individual components like verification tools and fine-tuning approaches exist, the integration of these components into a cohesive framework with recursive improvement is innovative. The comprehensive fault taxonomy aligned with verification outcomes and the error-to-explanation converter are particularly novel contributions. However, some aspects build upon existing work in verification and fine-tuning rather than introducing completely new techniques. The paper acknowledges related work appropriately and positions its contributions within the existing landscape."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "There are significant concerns about the soundness of the paper. Examining the provided code reveals that the experimental results appear to be generated using mock data rather than actual experiments. The file 'generate_mock_results.py' creates synthetic results with predetermined improvements, and the visualizations are based on these fabricated data. The learning curves show suspiciously smooth and consistent improvements across iterations. Additionally, the code implementation doesn't fully match the sophisticated methodology described in the paper - for example, the Error-to-Explanation Converter is much simpler than described. The experimental setup claims to use real datasets like HumanEval, but the actual evaluation appears to be simulated. This raises serious questions about whether the reported 20-30% improvements in pass rates are real or fabricated."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The problem addressed by the paper is significant - improving code generation reliability through verification feedback is an important challenge in the field. If the approach worked as claimed, it would represent a meaningful contribution to more reliable code generation systems. The framework's design is comprehensive and addresses a real gap in current approaches. However, the significance is substantially diminished by the questionable experimental validation. The paper claims 20-30% improvements in pass rates and 16-19% reductions in error rates, but these appear to be predetermined values in mock data generation rather than actual experimental outcomes. The potential impact remains theoretical without trustworthy empirical validation."

    "Overall": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "While the paper presents a well-articulated framework with promising theoretical contributions, the apparent fabrication of experimental results is a critical flaw that severely undermines its credibility. The disconnect between the sophisticated methodology described and the simplified mock implementation raises serious concerns about reproducibility and validity of the claimed improvements.",
