        "justification": "The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates its approach. The introduction effectively establishes the problem of LLM-generated code containing syntactic and semantic errors. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of both the Syntactic Steering Module (SSM) and Semantic Steering Module (SeSM), including mathematical formulations for token probability adjustments. The experimental setup and results are presented in a logical manner with appropriate tables and figures. However, there are some areas that could be clearer: the exact implementation details of the incremental semantic checker are somewhat vague, and the paper could benefit from more concrete examples of how the steering mechanisms work in practice."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel approach by integrating syntactic and semantic guidance directly into the LLM's decoding process, rather than applying post-hoc validation. The concept of 'correctness-by-construction' for LLM code generation is innovative. The authors acknowledge related work in post-hoc validation and formal methods integration, clearly positioning their contribution as a proactive approach. However, while the combination of techniques is novel, many of the individual components (grammar-based constraints, static analysis) have been explored in other contexts. The paper builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods for code verification."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper has significant issues with soundness. While the methodology is theoretically reasonable, there are concerning discrepancies between the paper and the code. The code in 'run_experiments.py' and 'simulate_results.py' suggests that the results may be simulated rather than from actual experiments. The 'simulate_results.py' file explicitly creates synthetic results with a bias toward SSCSteer performing better. The log files show minimal actual experiment runs, with errors like 'Error evaluating Full SSCSteer on problem semantic_null_check: list index out of range'. Additionally, the experimental results show suspiciously perfect improvements (e.g., bugs/KLOC reduced from exactly 5.73 to 1.09), and the ablation study results appear artificially constructed to show the importance of each component. These issues raise serious questions about whether the reported results are based on real experiments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The problem addressed by the paper is significant for the field of LLM code generation. Improving the correctness of generated code without extensive post-hoc validation would be valuable for developers and researchers. The reported improvements in syntactic validity (95.20%), pass rate (80.47%), and bug reduction (from 5.73 to 1.09 bugs/KLOC) would be impressive if verified. The approach aligns well with the VerifAI workshop's focus on bridging generative AI and formal verification. However, the significance is undermined by the questionable experimental methodology. If the results are simulated rather than real, the actual impact of the approach remains unproven. The paper also doesn't thoroughly address scalability concerns or evaluate on more complex programming tasks."

    "Overall": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper presents a promising approach to improving LLM code generation through syntactic and semantic steering. However, the serious concerns about the experimental methodology and potentially simulated results significantly undermine its credibility. While the theoretical framework is sound and well-presented, the lack of reliable empirical validation makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
