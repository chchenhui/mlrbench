        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The authors provide a logical flow from introduction to conclusion, with clear sections on methodology, experimental setup, and results. The DSL for function contracts is presented with a formal BNF notation and examples, making it easy to understand. Algorithm 1 formalizes the pipeline clearly. However, there are some areas that could be improved: (1) The paper lacks detailed examples of the counterexample-to-feedback translation process, which is a key contribution; (2) While figures are referenced, their content could be better explained in the text; (3) Some technical details about the static analyzer and SMT solver integration are not fully elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel integration of lightweight formal specifications with LLM-driven code generation in a closed-loop framework. The key novelty lies in the iterative 'spec-generate-verify-refine' cycle with natural language feedback from verification failures. While individual components (LLMs for code generation, formal verification) have been explored in prior work like VeCoGen and SpecGen, the complete closed-loop system with counterexample-to-feedback translation appears to be a meaningful advance. However, the approach builds significantly on existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. The DSL is described as 'minimal' and appears to be a simplified version of existing specification languages. The references to related work are appropriate, but some of the cited papers have suspiciously similar titles and may not be real (e.g., references 5-10 all follow similar naming patterns and have sequential arXiv numbers)."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The methodology is generally sound, but there are several concerns about the experimental validation: (1) The paper claims a 100% success rate for ContractGPT but doesn't adequately define what constitutes 'success' or how it's measured; (2) The evaluation metrics are described but not all are reported in the results; (3) The benchmark selection process isn't well-justified, and it's unclear if the benchmarks are representative or cherry-picked; (4) Statistical significance is claimed (p<0.01) but the statistical tests are not described in detail; (5) The user study with 10 developers is mentioned but results are only briefly summarized without methodological details; (6) No code is provided to verify the implementation or reproduce the results; (7) The figures show perfect 0.6 bug rate reduction for three different methods, which seems suspiciously uniform. These issues raise questions about the reliability and reproducibility of the results."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem at the intersection of formal methods and AI-assisted programming. Improving the correctness of LLM-generated code through formal verification has significant practical value for software development. The reported results, if valid, would represent a meaningful improvement over existing approaches. The framework could potentially be applied to various programming languages and domains. The lightweight DSL approach could make formal methods more accessible to developers without extensive formal methods expertise. However, the significance is somewhat limited by: (1) The relatively small set of benchmarks tested; (2) The focus on algorithmic problems rather than more complex real-world software; (3) The lack of comparison with human-written code or more sophisticated verification approaches; (4) Unclear scalability to larger codebases or more complex specifications."

    "Overall": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a promising approach to integrating formal methods with LLM-based code generation. The closed-loop framework with natural language feedback is well-motivated and potentially impactful. The experimental results, if reproducible, demonstrate clear improvements over baselines. However, methodological concerns about the evaluation, lack of detailed examples, and questions about the reproducibility of results prevent a higher score.",
