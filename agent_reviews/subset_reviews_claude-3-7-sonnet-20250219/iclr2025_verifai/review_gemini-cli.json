        "justification": "The paper is well-written and structured in a logical manner. The authors clearly articulate their research question, methodology, and findings. The paper includes a detailed explanation of the SMT-Repair framework, including the four-stage iterative repair loop (Generation, Verification, Translation, and Self-Correction). The experimental setup is thoroughly described, making it easy to understand what was tested and how. The figures effectively visualize the results, showing the pass rates and convergence rates of different methods. However, there are some minor issues: the paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the SMT solver's operation and how the counterexample-to-prompt translation works in practice."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel approach by integrating SMT solvers with LLMs for code repair. While both LLM-based code generation and formal verification methods exist separately, the specific combination proposed in SMT-Repair—using SMT solver counterexamples to guide LLM self-correction—represents an original contribution. The authors position their work well within existing literature, acknowledging related approaches like Self-Debugging and LLM-Sym while highlighting their unique contribution. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the simplicity of the counterexample-to-prompt (C2P) translation module, which appears to be a basic template rather than a sophisticated mechanism."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper's methodology is generally sound, with a clear experimental design comparing SMT-Repair against zero-shot and UT-Repair baselines. The code provided matches the described methodology, showing implementation of the framework and evaluation process. However, there are significant limitations that affect soundness: (1) The extremely small sample size (only 3 problems from HumanEval) makes it difficult to draw generalizable conclusions; (2) The C2P module implementation is rudimentary, which the authors acknowledge as a potential point of failure; (3) The convergence rate figure appears inconsistent with the textual results—it shows SMT-Repair improving to ~66% pass rate at iteration 1, contradicting the reported 33.3% final pass rate; (4) The paper doesn't provide detailed analysis of specific examples where SMT-Repair failed, which would strengthen the analysis section."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem in the intersection of formal methods and AI—improving the reliability of LLM-generated code. The negative result (SMT-Repair not outperforming UT-Repair) is itself significant, as it highlights practical challenges in translating formal verification outputs into actionable feedback for LLMs. The authors provide thoughtful analysis of why their approach failed and suggest valuable directions for future work. However, the significance is limited by the small scale of the experiment and the preliminary nature of the implementation. The paper represents an initial exploration rather than a comprehensive solution, and while it provides useful insights, its immediate impact on the field may be modest."
