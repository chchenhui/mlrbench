        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written with a clear structure that follows standard research paper organization. The authors clearly articulate the problem (the 'lemma bottleneck' in theorem proving), their proposed solution (LemmaGen), and the system architecture. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the four main components with appropriate mathematical notation. However, there are some areas that could be improved: (1) The explanation of the reinforcement update engine is somewhat vague about how 'success' is determined; (2) Some technical details about the implementation are missing, such as how the LLM is integrated with Coq in practice; (3) The figures referenced in the results section are basic bar charts that don't provide deep insights into the system's performance."

        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper presents an interesting approach to automating lemma generation in theorem proving, which addresses a specific bottleneck in the process. The integration of LLMs with formal verification tools like Coq is a relatively new area. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by: (1) The extensive related work section shows many similar approaches already exist (APOLLO, LemmaHead, Lemmanaid, etc.); (2) The core idea of using LLMs to generate lemmas is not fundamentally new, as evidenced by cited works like Lemmanaid [6]; (3) The reinforcement-style update mechanism, while potentially valuable, is not demonstrated in the actual experiments. The paper positions itself as filling a gap in 'systematic lemma generation with reinforcement-style updates,' but the experimental results don't actually show this component in action."

        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper has several significant methodological issues: (1) The experimental results are extremely limited - only three simple Coq problems were tested, and the model generated empty lemmas ('[]') for all of them, showing the system doesn't actually work as described; (2) The code provided shows a very basic implementation that doesn't match the sophisticated system architecture described in the paper - it's essentially just running a small T5 model on prompts without any of the filtering, integration with Coq via SerAPI, or reinforcement updates; (3) Many claims are made about the system's capabilities without supporting evidence - for example, the paper describes a 'reinforcement-style update engine' but there's no code or results showing this was implemented; (4) The figures in the paper show all problems generating exactly 1 lemma each, but the text admits these were empty lemmas, making the results essentially meaningless; (5) The references include papers dated 2025, which is in the future, suggesting fabricated citations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The problem being addressed - automating lemma generation in theorem proving - is genuinely important and could have significant impact on formal verification. However, the paper's actual contribution to the field is limited because: (1) The system as implemented doesn't actually generate useful lemmas, as admitted in the analysis section; (2) The experiments are extremely limited in scope (only 3 simple problems) and don't demonstrate the system working as intended; (3) Many components described in the methodology (filtering, integration with Coq, reinforcement updates) don't appear to be implemented in the code provided; (4) The paper doesn't demonstrate any improvement over existing approaches, as the system fails to generate any useful lemmas. While the conceptual framework could be valuable if fully implemented and shown to work, the current state of the research doesn't represent a significant contribution."
