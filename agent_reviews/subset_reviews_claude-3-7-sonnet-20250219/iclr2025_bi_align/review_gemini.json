        "justification": "The paper is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The authors clearly articulate the problem of human-AI alignment from a bidirectional perspective and explain their proposed solution (AI Cognitive Tutor) in a logical manner. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the three-phase approach, and the results are presented with appropriate visualizations. However, there are some areas that could be improved: (1) The paper could better clarify how the mental model accuracy was measured in practice; (2) The distinction between real and simulated participants is somewhat ambiguous in places; and (3) Some technical details about the tutor's implementation could be more precisely described."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel approach to addressing the 'Aligning Humans with AI' dimension of bidirectional human-AI alignment. The concept of an adaptive AI Cognitive Tutor that detects misunderstanding and provides tailored explanations is innovative and builds meaningfully on existing work. The authors cite relevant prior work (e.g., Baradari et al., Dong et al., Te'eni et al.) while clearly differentiating their contribution. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by: (1) The application of existing adaptive tutoring concepts to a new domain rather than developing fundamentally new techniques; and (2) The reliance on relatively straightforward intervention strategies rather than more sophisticated approaches to detecting and addressing misunderstandings."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper has significant methodological issues that undermine its soundness. The most critical concern is that the entire experiment appears to be simulated rather than conducted with real participants, despite being presented as if it involved actual human subjects. The code reveals that 'SimulatedParticipant' objects were used, with programmatically generated behaviors and responses. This fundamentally undermines the validity of the findings, as the 'participants' were designed to respond to interventions in predetermined ways. Additionally: (1) The statistical significance reported (p=0.0024 for mental model accuracy) is meaningless when applied to simulated data; (2) The visualizations present simulated results as if they were empirical findings; (3) The code shows that participant 'confusion' and 'understanding' were algorithmically determined rather than measured from real human responses. While the simulation approach itself could be valid as a proof-of-concept, the paper does not clearly acknowledge this limitation or the implications for interpreting the results."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem in human-AI alignment, focusing on the under-explored dimension of aligning humans with AI. The concept of an AI Cognitive Tutor has potential significance for improving human-AI collaboration in critical domains like healthcare. The reported improvements in mental model accuracy (33.2%) and reduced confusion (25.5%) would be meaningful if validated with real participants. However, the significance is limited by: (1) The reliance on simulated rather than real experimental data; (2) The modest improvement in diagnostic accuracy (4.8%, not statistically significant); (3) The lack of comparison with other potential approaches to improving human understanding of AI; and (4) The absence of a clear path to implementation in real-world AI systems. If validated with real participants, the approach could have greater significance, but as presented, its impact is constrained by these limitations."
