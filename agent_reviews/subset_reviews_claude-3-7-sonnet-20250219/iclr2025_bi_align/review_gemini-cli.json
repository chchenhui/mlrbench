        "justification": "The paper is well-written and structured in a logical manner. The authors clearly articulate the concept of bidirectional human-AI alignment and how their PAAC-Pro framework addresses this paradigm. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the two-stage process, with clear mathematical formulations for the DPO loss function. Figures and tables are well-presented and support the text. However, there are some areas that could be improved: (1) The transition between the theoretical framework and the preliminary experiment could be smoother, as it's not immediately clear why the authors chose to focus on the semantic alignment module first; (2) Some technical details about the counterfactual generation process are underspecified, such as how exactly the system identifies 'key semantic concepts' in a prompt."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel framework that combines several existing techniques in an innovative way. The bidirectional alignment approach is relatively new in the field, and the authors' implementation through interactive counterfactual probing offers a fresh perspective. The integration of counterfactual reasoning with an interactive auditing interface and DPO fine-tuning creates a coherent system that addresses both directions of alignment. However, many of the individual components (counterfactual reasoning, DPO fine-tuning, interactive interfaces) have been explored in prior work, as the authors acknowledge in their related work section. The novelty lies more in the integration and application of these techniques rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms or models."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "There are several methodological concerns that affect the soundness of this paper. First, the preliminary experiment on the semantic alignment module reveals a critical flaw - the complete failure of all models on the noisy test set (with accuracy and F1 scores near zero). This indicates a fundamental limitation in the approach, which the authors acknowledge but don't resolve. Second, the validation loss curve in Figure 2 is suspicious, showing completely flat values (-1) across all epochs, which contradicts the claim of 'stable convergence.' The code confirms this issue, as the loss_history.csv file contains placeholder values of -1 for all epochs. Third, while the authors claim their Bi-Align model achieved 95.5% accuracy, the experiment_results.csv shows that even the untrained base model achieved 93.3% accuracy, suggesting minimal improvement from their fine-tuning approach. Finally, the full PAAC-Pro system is not actually implemented or evaluated - only a preliminary component is tested, making many of the paper's claims speculative."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem in AI alignment, and the bidirectional framework has potential significance for the field. The interactive approach to alignment could help bridge the gap between technical AI safety and human-centered design. However, the significance is limited by several factors: (1) The preliminary results show a critical failure in handling non-parallel text, which would be common in real-world applications; (2) The paper only evaluates a small component of the proposed system rather than demonstrating the full framework in action; (3) The evaluation is conducted on a bilingual alignment task rather than on actual LLM alignment scenarios, making it unclear how well the approach would transfer to the intended application. While the ideas are promising, the current implementation and results don't yet demonstrate significant practical impact."
