        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The paper is generally well-written with a clear structure that follows standard scientific format. The authors articulate their ideas in a logical progression from problem statement to methodology to results. The UDRA framework is explained systematically with formal mathematical notation in Section 3, breaking down the approach into well-defined components (Bayesian user modeling, multi-objective RL, uncertainty estimation, etc.). The experimental setup and metrics are clearly defined. However, there are some areas that could be improved: (1) Algorithm 1 is mentioned but not shown in the paper, (2) some figures (trust calibration plots) have limited data points making trends difficult to interpret, and (3) the explanation of how trust calibration is measured could be more detailed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel integration of several existing techniques into a cohesive bidirectional alignment framework. The key innovation is the combination of uncertainty quantification, Bayesian preference modeling, and interactive feedback mechanisms to create a dynamic alignment process. While individual components (Bayesian user modeling, uncertainty visualization, multi-objective RL) exist in prior work, their integration into a bidirectional framework that simultaneously updates both AI policy and human preference models is relatively novel. The paper builds upon existing work like the Human-AI Handshake Framework but adds concrete mechanisms for uncertainty-driven interaction. However, the approach is more of an integration of known techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical insights."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper presents a theoretically sound approach with appropriate mathematical formulations. However, several methodological issues raise concerns: (1) The evaluation relies on simulated users rather than real human participants, which limits ecological validity; (2) The figures show inconsistent results - particularly in the safety environment where alignment error plots (Figure 6) don't clearly demonstrate the 54.5% improvement claimed in Table 2; (3) The trust calibration plots (Figures 3 and 7) have very few data points and show erratic patterns that don't convincingly support the claims of improved calibration; (4) The paper claims statistical significance but doesn't report p-values or effect sizes; (5) The dramatic performance drop in the safety environment (-87.1% task reward) is concerning and inadequately explained as merely 'cautious behavior'. These issues suggest that while the approach is theoretically sound, the empirical validation has significant limitations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem in human-AI alignment - the need for bidirectional, dynamic alignment processes that account for uncertainty and evolving preferences. The proposed UDRA framework offers a practical approach to implementing bidirectional alignment that could be applied to various domains. The results in the resource allocation environment are promising, showing maintained task performance with improved trust calibration. However, the significant performance degradation in the safety-critical environment (-87.1% task reward) raises questions about real-world applicability in high-stakes domains. The paper acknowledges limitations regarding simulated users and simplified environments, which limits immediate impact. Nevertheless, the framework provides a valuable foundation for future work on dynamic human-AI alignment systems, particularly in incorporating uncertainty awareness into alignment processes."
