        "justification": "The paper is well-structured and presents its ideas in a logical flow. The authors clearly articulate the concept of bidirectional human-AI alignment and their proposed UDCA framework. The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations for the Bayesian preference modeling and uncertainty-driven query selection. The figures effectively illustrate the experimental results. However, there are a few areas that could be improved: (1) some mathematical notation is introduced without sufficient explanation (e.g., the KL divergence formula), (2) the user study details are somewhat sparse, and (3) the paper could benefit from more explicit definitions of some metrics like 'mental-model accuracy'."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper introduces a novel framework (UDCA) that combines several existing techniques in a unique way to address bidirectional human-AI alignment. The integration of Bayesian uncertainty estimation, active information-theoretic querying, and transparent suggestion visualization represents an advancement over existing approaches. The bidirectional aspect, where both the AI system and the human user adapt their models of each other, is particularly innovative. However, many of the individual components (Bayesian preference modeling, active learning, uncertainty visualization) have been explored in prior work, and the paper builds incrementally on these established techniques rather than presenting a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The theoretical foundation of the UDCA framework is generally sound, with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental methodology includes both simulated and user studies, which is good practice. However, there are several concerns: (1) The provided code implements only the simulated recommendation task, not the interactive planning benchmark or user study mentioned in the paper. (2) The PCE results in the paper text (Section 5) don't match the visualization in Figure 2 - the paper claims UDCA achieves PCE of ≈1.5 vs 6.4 (static) and 0.3 (passive), but the figure shows passive with the lowest PCE. (3) The paper mentions a user study with N=30 participants, but provides very limited details on methodology and only reports a 15% increase in trust scores without comprehensive statistics. (4) The paper claims UDCA reduces preference calibration error by ≥80%, but this isn't clearly supported by the data presented."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem in AI alignment by focusing on the bidirectional nature of human-AI interaction. The UDCA framework has potential applications in recommendation systems, planning tasks, and other interactive AI scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate meaningful improvements in decision quality and preference calibration compared to baseline approaches. The release of an algorithm and UI toolkit could facilitate further research in this area. However, the work is limited by its reliance on synthetic features and simulated users for most experiments, and the small-scale user study. The real-world impact would depend on how well the approach scales to more complex domains and realistic user preferences."
