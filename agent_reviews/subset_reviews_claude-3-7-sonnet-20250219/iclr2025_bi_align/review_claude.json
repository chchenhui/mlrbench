        "justification": "The paper is well-structured and generally well-written, with clear organization into standard sections (introduction, related work, framework, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion). The authors effectively articulate the concept of co-evolutionary value alignment and its importance. Key concepts are defined early, and the mathematical formulations in Section 3.1 help formalize the framework. Figures and tables effectively illustrate results. However, there are some areas that could be clearer: (1) The distinction between ceva_basic and ceva_full models is not always obvious in the results discussion; (2) Some mathematical notations in Section 3.1 could benefit from more explanation; (3) The bidirectional feedback mechanisms could be explained more concretely with examples."

        "justification": "The paper presents a novel framework for addressing the dynamic nature of human-AI value alignment. The co-evolutionary perspective that explicitly models how human values and AI capabilities adapt to each other over time is a valuable contribution. The multi-level value representation with differential adaptation rates for different types of values (core safety, cultural, personal) is innovative. The paper builds upon existing work in bidirectional human-AI alignment but extends it significantly by providing formal mathematical models and implementation approaches. However, some individual components (like adaptive alignment) are not entirely new, and the bidirectional feedback mechanisms described are relatively straightforward extensions of existing approaches. The paper acknowledges its foundations in prior work by Shen (2024), Pedreschi et al. (2023), and Pyae (2025)."

        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The paper presents a reasonable theoretical framework and evaluation methodology, but has several methodological limitations. The experimental design tests the models across different scenarios (gradual drift, rapid shift, value conflict), which is appropriate. However, there are significant concerns: (1) The evaluation relies entirely on simulated data rather than real human-AI interactions; (2) The metrics for 'user satisfaction' and 'agency preservation' are highly simplified proxies; (3) The code implementation shows that the ceva_basic and ceva_full models have identical value evolution patterns in the figures, raising questions about whether the bidirectional component is properly implemented; (4) The paper claims the adaptive_alignment model achieves the highest adaptation accuracy (0.961) and user satisfaction (0.921), which contradicts the hypothesis that CEVA models would perform better; (5) The agency preservation metric shows a significant drop for ceva_full without adequate explanation. While the mathematical framework is sound, the experimental validation has limitations that affect the reliability of the conclusions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem in AI alignment: how to maintain alignment as human values evolve over time. This is a critical challenge that has received insufficient attention in the literature. The CEVA framework provides a promising direction for more sustainable alignment approaches. The multi-level value representation with different adaptation rates could influence future alignment system designs. The experimental results, while limited to simulations, provide useful insights into the trade-offs between adaptation accuracy, stability, and agency preservation. The paper's significance is somewhat limited by: (1) The lack of real-world validation with actual human subjects; (2) The simplified representation of human values as a five-dimensional vector; (3) The finding that simple adaptive alignment outperformed the more complex CEVA models on key metrics. Nevertheless, the conceptual framework and the identification of key challenges in co-evolutionary alignment represent valuable contributions to the field."
