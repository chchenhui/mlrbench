        "justification": "The paper is well-written and structured in a logical manner. The introduction clearly establishes the problem of dataset deprecation in ML repositories and the need for standardized processes. The framework components are explained thoroughly in Section 3, with formal definitions and mathematical notations that enhance precision. The experimental design and evaluation methodology are well-documented in Sections 4 and 5. However, there are some areas that could be improved: the relationship between the five components could be more explicitly connected, and some technical details in the implementation architecture section are somewhat vague (e.g., how the API integration would work with different repository systems)."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper presents a novel framework for dataset deprecation that goes beyond existing approaches. While prior work by Luccioni et al. (2021) introduced initial considerations for dataset deprecation, this paper extends those ideas with concrete implementation mechanisms and a comprehensive framework with five interconnected components. The tiered warning system, context-preserving deprecation, and alternative recommendation system are particularly innovative contributions. However, some components build incrementally on existing practices in software deprecation and data management rather than representing completely new ideas. The paper acknowledges its relationship to prior work and clearly positions its contributions as addressing gaps in existing approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper has significant methodological issues that undermine its soundness. The experimental evaluation relies entirely on simulated data and user behavior rather than real-world testing. The code reveals that the results presented in the paper are based on synthetic datasets and simulated user responses with predetermined parameters that favor the proposed framework. The figures in the paper (e.g., acknowledgment time, access control grant rate, citation patterns) are generated from this simulation rather than from actual user studies or real repository data. The mathematical formulations for similarity calculations and access control decisions appear reasonable in theory, but their practical effectiveness is not validated with real datasets or users. Additionally, the citation pattern graph shown in the paper appears empty/blank, suggesting visualization issues or potentially fabricated results. While simulation is a valid approach for initial testing, the paper presents these results as empirical evidence without adequately acknowledging these limitations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper addresses an important problem in machine learning data practices. As datasets become increasingly central to ML research and applications, having standardized processes for deprecating problematic datasets is critical for ethical AI development. The framework proposed could have significant practical impact if implemented by major ML repositories. The paper makes a valuable contribution by formalizing the dataset deprecation process and providing concrete mechanisms for implementation. The five components of the framework address real needs in the ML community, particularly the balance between ethical considerations and research continuity. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the lack of real-world validation and the absence of engagement with actual repository administrators or users to confirm the framework's practicality and effectiveness."
