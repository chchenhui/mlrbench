        "justification": "The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a logical flow from introduction to conclusion. The methodology is explained in detail with appropriate subsections covering execution trace capture, alignment algorithms, and iterative refinement. The figures effectively illustrate the results, showing improvements in Pass@k rates and error reduction. Technical concepts like DPO and RLAIF are explained adequately. However, some aspects could be improved: the distinction between the two alignment methods (DPO and RLAIF) could be more clearly delineated, and the paper would benefit from more concrete examples of execution traces and how they translate to preference pairs."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The paper introduces a novel framework (IETA) that leverages execution traces for aligning code generation models. While prior work has used compiler feedback (Dou et al., 2024) and unit test results (Liu et al., 2023), this paper's contribution lies in using fine-grained execution traces including runtime errors, exceptions, and variable states as feedback signals. The application of preference-based learning methods (DPO and RLAIF) to execution trace feedback is innovative. However, the core techniques (DPO, RLAIF) are adapted rather than newly developed, and the execution trace capture mechanism builds upon existing debugging and tracing tools. The paper acknowledges its relationship to prior work while highlighting its unique contributions."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "There are significant concerns about the soundness of the experimental results. Upon examining the code, it appears that the experiments use synthetic data and simulated results rather than actual model training and evaluation. The code contains functions like 'run_synthetic_experiment()' and 'generate_synthetic_dataset()' that create artificial performance improvements. The training loss curves for DPO and RLAIF are identical, suggesting they were generated using the same code. The error reduction tables show identical values for both methods, which is highly suspicious. The paper presents these simulated results as if they were from real experiments, which is misleading. While the methodology itself appears theoretically sound, the lack of genuine experimental validation severely undermines the paper's claims about the effectiveness of the IETA framework."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The problem addressed by the paper—improving the reliability of code generated by LLMs—is important and relevant to the field. The proposed approach of using execution traces for alignment could potentially lead to more robust code generation models. The reported improvements (24.6% relative improvement in Pass@1 and 12.4% in execution rate) would be significant if they were based on real experiments. The concept of developing an 'execution sense' in models is valuable. However, the significance is diminished by the use of simulated results rather than actual experimental validation. Additionally, the evaluation is limited to the HumanEval benchmark and a single model (claude-3-7-sonnet), which restricts the generalizability of the findings."
