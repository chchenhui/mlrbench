        "justification": "The paper presents a clear high-level structure with standard sections, and the core idea of a two-stage framework combining retrieval-augmented pretraining with RL fine-tuning is articulated. However, there are several clarity issues: (1) The methodology section contains mathematical formulations but lacks sufficient explanation of how these are implemented in practice; (2) The experiment results section is extremely sparse, reporting BLEU scores on only 5 examples without explaining why such a limited evaluation was performed; (3) The paper mentions 'full RL fine-tuning experiments (omitted here)' without explaining why these critical results are missing; (4) Several references appear to be from the future (2025) or unpublished, raising questions about their validity."

        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The paper proposes combining retrieval-augmented generation with reinforcement learning for GitHub issue resolution, which represents an incremental advance over existing approaches. The authors acknowledge building upon prior work like RLTF, ChatDev, and AutoDev. While the integration of retrieval, generation, RLHF, and a gated controller is presented as novel, the individual components are well-established techniques. The paper lacks a clear articulation of what specific technical innovations are introduced beyond combining existing methods. The retrieval-augmented approach shown in the experiments is a standard technique in the field."

        "score": 3,
        "justification": "The paper has significant soundness issues: (1) The experimental results are extremely limited, reporting BLEU scores on only 5 examples, which is insufficient for drawing meaningful conclusions; (2) The code provided shows that the experiment was run on the MBPP dataset, not on GitHub issues as claimed in the paper; (3) The paper mentions a 'IssuePR-1M' dataset but provides no details on how it was constructed or validated; (4) The RL fine-tuning results, which are central to the paper's claims, are completely omitted; (5) The paper cites future papers (2025) and unpublished works, raising questions about the validity of the references; (6) The figure shows a baseline BLEU of 0.00 and retrieval of 1.02, but the code's visualization shows different values, suggesting inconsistency between the reported results and the actual implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 4,
        "justification": "The problem of automating GitHub issue resolution is important and relevant to the workshop's focus on deep learning for code. However, the paper's significance is limited by: (1) The extremely preliminary nature of the results, showing only a modest BLEU improvement on 5 examples; (2) The omission of the RL fine-tuning results, which are central to the paper's claimed contributions; (3) The lack of comparison with strong baselines or state-of-the-art approaches; (4) The absence of evaluation on real GitHub issues, despite this being the paper's focus. The potential impact is further diminished by the questionable experimental methodology and limited evaluation."
