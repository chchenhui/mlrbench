        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the HAIC 2025 workshop's focus on human-AI coevolution. It directly addresses the workshop's emphasis on understanding feedback loops in continuous human-AI coadaptation and goes beyond traditional AI performance benchmarks. The proposed framework specifically targets longitudinal interactions, mutual adaptation, and dynamic alignment - all central themes of the workshop. The idea spans multiple subject areas listed in the task description, particularly 'Human-AI Interaction and Alignment,' 'Bidirectional Learning Beyond Performance Metrics,' and 'Dynamic Feedback Loops in Socially Impactful Domains.' The only minor limitation is that while it mentions applications in healthcare, it could more explicitly address other socially impactful domains mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. It clearly articulates the motivation, main idea, methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact. The three-step methodology provides a concrete roadmap for implementation, specifying both human metrics (accuracy, response time, trust surveys) and AI metrics (policy shift, uncertainty, bias drift). The concept of a 'Coevolution Score' is introduced as a composite measure. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further elaboration - for instance, how exactly the information-theoretic measures and dynamic time-warping will be implemented to capture feedback loop strength, and how the composite score will be calculated from the various metrics. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving the highest clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposed framework demonstrates exceptional novelty in the field of AI evaluation. While there has been growing interest in human-AI interaction, the idea of systematically quantifying coevolution using a unified framework of behavioral, cognitive, and algorithmic metrics represents a significant advancement. The application of information-theoretic measures and dynamic time-warping to capture mutual adaptation is particularly innovative. The concept of a 'Coevolution Score' that measures adaptation speed, alignment drift, and mutual dependency appears to be a novel contribution that could establish new standards in the field. The approach moves beyond static evaluation paradigms to capture the dynamic nature of human-AI relationships, which is a substantial departure from conventional benchmarking approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The longitudinal nature of the study requires sustained participant engagement, which can be resource-intensive and subject to attrition. Measuring cognitive load and trust accurately over time presents methodological challenges. The information-theoretic measures and dynamic time-warping techniques, while established in their respective fields, may require significant adaptation for this novel application. Computing a meaningful 'Coevolution Score' that validly represents the complex dynamics of human-AI interaction will require careful validation. However, the methodology is grounded in established measurement techniques, and the step-by-step approach is logical and implementable with current technology and methods, making the overall idea feasible with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in AI evaluation by focusing on the dynamic, coevolutionary nature of human-AI interactions rather than static performance metrics. As AI systems become more integrated into society, understanding how humans and AI mutually adapt over time is crucial for ensuring beneficial outcomes. The proposed framework could significantly impact how AI systems are designed, evaluated, and deployed across multiple domains. By providing quantitative measures of coevolution, it enables more systematic approaches to alignment with human values and preferences. The potential applications in socially impactful domains like healthcare further enhance its significance. This work could establish foundational methodologies for a new paradigm in AI evaluation that accounts for the bidirectional influence between humans and AI systems."
