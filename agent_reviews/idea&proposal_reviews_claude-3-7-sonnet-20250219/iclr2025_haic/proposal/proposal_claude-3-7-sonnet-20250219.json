        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the HAIC 2025 workshop's focus on human-AI coevolution, particularly in the healthcare domain. The proposal thoroughly explores bidirectional adaptation between humans and AI systems over extended periods, which is central to the workshop's theme. It incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the simulation framework, bias-aware co-correction mechanism, and validation through a diabetes management case study. The proposal also effectively integrates concepts from the literature review, such as causal mediation analysis (Martinez & Wang, 2024), reinforcement learning in healthcare (Lee & Kim, 2023), and the looping inequity metric (Zhang & Patel, 2025). The methodology addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly regarding bias perpetuation, dynamic feedback loops, and longitudinal impact assessment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the three-component methodology is thoroughly explained with appropriate mathematical formulations. The simulation framework, bias-aware co-correction mechanism, and validation case study are all described in detail with specific implementation approaches. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly delineated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the AI-side and human-side correction mechanisms could be more explicitly connected, (2) some of the mathematical notations (particularly in the causal mediation analysis) might benefit from further explanation for interdisciplinary audiences, and (3) the distinction between the simulation environment and real-world validation could be more clearly articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. The concept of 'human-AI coevolution' as applied to healthcare bias mitigation represents a fresh perspective that extends beyond traditional static fairness approaches. The bias-aware co-correction mechanism that operates bidirectionally is particularly innovative, as it addresses both the AI system's adaptation and the human response simultaneously. The introduction of the 'looping inequity metric' to quantify bias amplification through feedback loops is a novel contribution that addresses a gap in current evaluation methods. The application of causal mediation analysis to understand bias mechanisms in human-AI feedback loops is also innovative. While some individual components (like reinforcement learning or explainable AI) build on existing approaches, their integration into a comprehensive framework for modeling and mitigating bias in bidirectional human-AI feedback loops represents a novel contribution to the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The mathematical formulations for the patient model, AI agent model, and bidirectional adaptation model are well-defined and grounded in established techniques like reinforcement learning and Q-learning. The causal mediation analysis approach to bias detection is theoretically sound and appropriate for identifying mechanisms of bias propagation. The experimental design for the validation case study is comprehensive, with appropriate baseline conditions and outcome measures. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) the proposal assumes that synthetic patient data will adequately capture real-world complexities of patient behavior, which may be an oversimplification; (2) the trust recalibration model (g_T function) is not fully specified, leaving questions about how trust dynamics will be accurately modeled; and (3) while the looping inequity metric is innovative, its validity and reliability as a measure of bias amplification would need further justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the technical components (reinforcement learning, causal analysis, simulation environment) utilize established libraries and frameworks, and the implementation details are well-specified. The 5-year simulation timeframe is reasonable for capturing long-term effects. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) creating realistic synthetic patient populations that accurately model complex human behavior, particularly treatment adherence and trust dynamics, is extremely challenging; (2) the causal mediation analysis requires strong assumptions about confounding that may be difficult to satisfy in practice; (3) the validation with domain experts (healthcare providers and patients) is mentioned but the recruitment and engagement strategy is not detailed; (4) the computational resources required for running multiple simulations over extended time periods could be substantial; and (5) the integration of all components (patient model, AI model, bidirectional adaptation, bias correction) into a cohesive system represents a significant engineering challenge."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem with substantial real-world implications. Healthcare AI systems are being rapidly deployed, and understanding how they interact with humans over time is essential for ensuring equitable outcomes. The research directly tackles the challenge of bias amplification through feedback loops, which could have profound impacts on health disparities. The anticipated findings, if realized, would provide actionable insights for designing more equitable AI systems in healthcare. The theoretical contributions extend beyond healthcare to advance our understanding of human-AI coevolution more broadly. The practical applications are well-articulated and could influence clinical decision support systems, regulatory guidelines, and patient education tools. The focus on historically marginalized populations aligns with urgent societal needs to reduce rather than exacerbate health disparities. The interdisciplinary nature of the work bridges machine learning, causal inference, behavioral science, and healthcare, potentially catalyzing new collaborations and approaches to AI ethics and fairness."
