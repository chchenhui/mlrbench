        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central question of 'what do we need for successful domain generalization?' by proposing that causal structure awareness is a key ingredient. The proposal incorporates the suggested approach from the research idea of integrating causal discovery with representation learning and using domain-level metadata to infer causal graphs. It builds upon the literature review's identified challenges, particularly addressing the issues of identifying invariant causal features and integrating causal discovery with representation learning. The methodology section thoroughly details how the proposal will leverage domain-level metadata (as mentioned in the workshop topics) and implement causal modeling for robustness to distribution shift. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions papers from 2021-2025, the proposal cites some older works (e.g., Spirtes et al., 2000) without fully acknowledging the most recent advancements mentioned in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated in the introduction, and the methodology is systematically organized with clear subsections that build logically upon each other. The technical formulations are presented with appropriate mathematical notation, making the approach understandable to those familiar with the field. The experimental design section provides a comprehensive overview of datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The exact implementation details of the causal discovery algorithm could be more precisely defined, particularly how domain metadata is incorporated; (2) The mutual information terms in the loss functions could be elaborated on with specific estimation techniques; and (3) The relationship between the discovered causal graph and the architecture of the neural network could be more explicitly defined. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is well-articulated and follows a coherent structure."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The integration of causal structure discovery with representation learning for domain generalization represents a fresh approach that goes beyond existing methods. The use of domain-level metadata to inform causal discovery and the decomposition of features into causal and non-causal components are innovative elements. The proposed causal structure-guided training with multiple specialized loss functions (invariance, causal, disentanglement) offers a novel framework for enforcing causal consistency. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing work in causality-inspired representation learning (as acknowledged in the introduction with references to Lv et al., 2022 and Wang et al., 2021), and some components like adversarial training for domain invariance have been explored in prior work. The causal discovery approach extends existing algorithms rather than proposing fundamentally new ones. While the combination and integration of these elements is novel, individual components share similarities with existing approaches in the literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness in its approach. The theoretical foundations are well-established, drawing from causal inference, representation learning, and domain generalization literature. The methodology is rigorous, with clear mathematical formulations for the various components of the framework. The causal discovery process builds on established algorithms (PC algorithm) with appropriate extensions for multi-domain settings. The loss functions are well-defined and aligned with the theoretical objectives. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas that could benefit from stronger justification: (1) The assumption that the causal structure remains constant across domains while only distributions change may not hold in all real-world scenarios; (2) The effectiveness of constraint-based causal discovery methods in high-dimensional spaces with limited samples could be more thoroughly addressed; and (3) The computational feasibility of the mutual information estimation in the loss functions could be better justified. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is technically sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the approach builds on existing methods and frameworks that have been demonstrated in the literature, such as causal discovery algorithms and adversarial training techniques. The datasets and evaluation protocols are well-established in the domain generalization community. The decomposition of the research into clear components (causal discovery, representation learning, regularization) allows for incremental development and testing. However, several aspects present feasibility challenges: (1) Accurate causal discovery from observational data is notoriously difficult, especially in high-dimensional spaces with potential unobserved confounders; (2) The computation of mutual information terms in the loss functions can be computationally expensive and may require approximations; (3) The integration of multiple complex loss terms may lead to optimization difficulties and hyperparameter sensitivity; and (4) The evaluation of causal consistency requires ground truth causal structures which may not be available for real-world datasets. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the proposal infeasible, but rather indicate areas requiring careful implementation and potential simplifications."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning: the ability to generalize across domains with different distributions. This is a fundamental challenge with wide-ranging applications in healthcare, autonomous systems, and climate science, as correctly identified in the proposal. The significance lies in several aspects: (1) The approach tackles a core limitation of current domain generalization methods by explicitly modeling causal structure; (2) If successful, it would provide both theoretical insights into the conditions for successful generalization and practical tools for building more robust models; (3) The focus on interpretability through causal alignment adds value beyond performance metrics; and (4) The potential applications in critical domains where distribution shifts are common and reliability is essential amplifies the impact. The proposal correctly identifies that current general-purpose DG approaches struggle to outperform ERM baselines consistently, making this research direction particularly valuable. While the significance is high, the ultimate impact depends on the degree of improvement over existing methods and the generalizability of the approach across different types of domain shifts."
