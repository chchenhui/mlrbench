    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central question of 'what do we need for successful domain generalization' by proposing causal structure-aware learning as a solution. The proposal incorporates domain-level metadata and causal modeling as specified in the workshop topics. It follows the research idea closely, developing a framework that integrates causal discovery with representation learning to extract domain-invariant causal features. The methodology references relevant concepts from the literature review, such as aligning with approaches like Contrastive ACE and CIRL mentioned in the literature. The proposal acknowledges the challenges identified in the literature review, including identifying invariant causal features and integrating causal discovery with representation learning. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions papers up to 2025, the proposal doesn't explicitly build upon the most recent work (Unsupervised Structural-Counterfactual Generation under Domain Shift)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with well-defined components. The mathematical formulations are precise, with clear notation for the causal graph, loss functions, and regularization terms. The experimental design is comprehensive, detailing baselines, evaluation metrics, and implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for how the inferred causal graph is incorporated into the neural network architecture could be more detailed, (2) The relationship between the causal regularization layer and the feature extractor could be more explicitly defined, and (3) The proposal could more clearly explain how domain-specific confounders are modeled as latent variables in the causal discovery process."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating causal discovery with representation learning for domain generalization. The approach of using domain-level metadata to infer causal structures and then enforcing invariance through causal regularization is innovative. The causal alignment penalty that enforces sparse alignment with the inferred causal graph is a novel contribution. However, the core ideas build upon existing work in causal representation learning (as acknowledged in the literature review, such as CIRL and Contrastive ACE). The adapted NOTEARS algorithm for multi-domain data and the domain-aware modifications for modeling domain-specific confounders show incremental innovation rather than groundbreaking novelty. The proposal extends existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in causal inference and representation learning principles. The methodology is rigorous, with well-defined mathematical formulations for causal discovery and invariant representation learning. The use of constraint-based causal discovery algorithms and the adaptation of NOTEARS for multi-domain data are theoretically justified. The loss function combines empirical risk minimization with principled invariance and causal alignment penalties. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address the identifiability issues in causal discovery from observational data, (2) The theoretical guarantees mentioned in expected outcomes are not elaborated upon, and (3) The assumption that the inferred causal graph accurately represents the true data-generating process may be overly optimistic given the challenges of causal discovery in complex domains."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents several implementation challenges. The use of existing datasets (DomainBed benchmarks) and standard neural network architectures (ResNet-50) is practical. The optimization approach and hyperparameter tuning strategy are reasonable. However, significant challenges include: (1) Accurate causal discovery from high-dimensional image data is extremely difficult and may not yield reliable causal graphs, (2) The computational complexity of constraint-based causal discovery algorithms may not scale well to large datasets, (3) The proposal doesn't address how to handle latent confounders that are common in real-world data, (4) The integration of discrete causal graph structures with continuous neural network optimization is challenging and may require approximations that compromise the theoretical guarantees, and (5) The effectiveness of the approach heavily depends on the quality of the inferred causal graph, which is a strong assumption given the limitations of current causal discovery methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning: the inability of models to generalize to unseen domains. If successful, the framework could significantly advance domain generalization by providing a principled approach to extract invariant causal features. The potential applications in high-stakes domains like medical imaging and autonomous driving underscore its importance. The integration of causal inference with deep learning could inspire new research directions in robust AI. The expected outcomes, including improved generalization performance and reduced reliance on spurious features, would be valuable contributions to the field. The proposal also aligns with broader goals of building trustworthy AI systems that can be reliably deployed in dynamic real-world environments. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the feasibility challenges noted above, which may restrict the practical impact of the approach in the near term."
