    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap between optimization theory and practice in deep learning, specifically focusing on the Edge of Stability phenomenon mentioned in the task description. The proposal incorporates the core elements from the research idea, including periodic curvature probing via Hessian approximations, dynamic adjustment of hyperparameters based on spectral properties, and the goal of improving training stability and generalization. The methodology thoroughly builds upon the literature review, citing relevant works like Cohen et al. (2022) and Damian et al. (2022) on the Edge of Stability, and positions itself as an advancement over existing approaches like ADLER and Hi-DLR mentioned in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions papers up to 2025, the proposal doesn't explicitly reference some of the most recent works, though it does incorporate their concepts."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined with four specific goals. The algorithmic details are presented with precise mathematical formulations, including equations for Hessian approximation, curvature metrics, and hyperparameter adaptation rules. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive, specifying baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. Figures are referenced (e.g., 'Fig. 1') though not actually provided in the excerpt. The only areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more specific details on the computational efficiency optimizations to address the known overhead of Hessian calculations, and (2) clearer explanation of how the spectral gap specifically contributes to optimization beyond what is captured by the spectral radius alone. Overall, the proposal is highly understandable with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a dynamic optimizer that explicitly leverages curvature information from the Edge of Stability phenomenon. While second-order and quasi-Newton methods exist, DCAO's innovation lies in its periodic curvature probing approach and the specific adaptation rules for multiple hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum, and weight decay) based on spectral properties. The proposal builds upon existing work like ADLER and Hi-DLR mentioned in the literature review but differentiates itself by focusing specifically on the Edge of Stability regime and incorporating spectral gap information. The momentum adaptation formula using the spectral gap is particularly novel. However, the core techniques (Lanczos method for Hessian approximation, learning rate adaptation based on curvature) have precedents in the literature, limiting the proposal from achieving the highest novelty score. The work represents a thoughtful integration and extension of existing approaches rather than a completely groundbreaking method."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The mathematical formulations for Hessian approximation using stochastic Lanczos iterations are correct and established in the literature. The hyperparameter adaptation rules are derived from sound principles of optimization theory, particularly the relationship between spectral radius and the stability threshold (2/η). The theoretical analysis provides convergence bounds under appropriate assumptions of L-smoothness and μ-strong convexity. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive and includes appropriate baselines and metrics. The proposal acknowledges the computational challenges of Hessian calculations and addresses them through periodic probing and low-rank approximations. The only aspects that slightly reduce the soundness score are: (1) the assumption that spectral gap is a reliable indicator for momentum adjustment could benefit from more theoretical justification, and (2) the exact relationship between the proposed weight decay adaptation formula and its effect on sharp minima could be more rigorously established."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with some implementation challenges. The core components—stochastic Lanczos for Hessian approximation, spectral analysis, and hyperparameter adaptation—are all implementable with current technology and libraries. The proposal acknowledges computational overhead concerns and addresses them by computing Hessian approximations only periodically (every T=100 steps) and using low-rank approximations. The expected overhead (<10% per epoch vs. Adam) seems reasonable given these optimizations. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive but ambitious, covering multiple model architectures (ResNet-50, ViT, BERT, GPT-2) and datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet, GLUE). This breadth of experiments may require significant computational resources. The proposal doesn't fully address potential numerical stability issues that might arise during Hessian approximation in very deep networks or the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameters like the stability margin κ, temperature τ, and reference sharpness λ_ref. Overall, while implementation is feasible, it would require careful engineering and potentially substantial computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in deep learning optimization—bridging the gap between theoretical understanding of the Edge of Stability and practical optimization methods. If successful, DCAO could significantly impact both theoretical understanding and practical training of deep neural networks. The expected outcomes include concrete improvements in generalization (1-3% higher accuracy for vision models, 2-5% lower perplexity for language models) and training stability. These improvements, while not revolutionary, would be meaningful advances in the field. The theoretical contributions would enhance our understanding of optimization dynamics in non-smooth landscapes. The proposal has potential to influence optimizer design in major frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's direct connection to the Edge of Stability phenomenon, which has been identified as a fundamental aspect of deep learning optimization. The work could inspire further research into geometry-aware training methods and adaptive optimization. The only factor limiting the highest significance score is that the expected improvements, while valuable, are incremental rather than transformative."
