        "justification": "The Dynamic Curvature-Aware Optimizer (DCAO) idea aligns excellently with the task's focus on bridging the gap between theory and practice in deep learning. It directly addresses the 'Optimization theory for deep learning' topic, specifically targeting the Edge of Stability phenomenon and non-smoothness of neural network landscapes mentioned in the task description. The proposal explicitly aims to 'narrow the theory-practice divide by operationalizing curvature-based analyses,' which is precisely what the workshop seeks. The idea incorporates theoretical insights about loss landscapes while developing a practical optimizer that can be implemented in real-world training pipelines."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, approach, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is specific and concrete - using stochastic Lanczos iterations for low-rank Hessian approximations and deriving curvature metrics to dynamically adjust optimization parameters. The implementation strategy is also well-defined, mentioning periodic computation of eigenpairs and integration into existing pipelines. However, some minor ambiguities exist: the exact frequency of curvature probing is not specified, the precise mechanism for translating curvature metrics into optimizer parameter adjustments could be more detailed, and the computational overhead tradeoffs could be more explicitly quantified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. While curvature-aware optimization and Hessian approximations are not new in themselves, the dynamic adjustment of multiple optimization parameters (learning rate, momentum, weight decay) based on spectral properties represents a fresh approach. The periodic probing strategy to balance computational cost with curvature awareness is innovative. However, the approach builds significantly on existing techniques like Lanczos iterations and Hessian-based optimization rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The novelty lies more in the integration and application of these techniques specifically to address the Edge-of-Stability phenomenon rather than in developing entirely new optimization principles."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Stochastic Lanczos iterations for Hessian approximation are well-established, and the periodic computation strategy helps manage computational overhead. The integration with existing optimizers seems practical. However, there are implementation challenges: computing even approximate Hessian information for large models can be computationally expensive, potentially limiting applicability to very large models. The proposal acknowledges 'minimal overhead,' but this may be optimistic for large-scale models. Additionally, determining the optimal frequency for curvature probing and translating spectral properties into optimizer parameter adjustments will require careful tuning and experimentation. These challenges are significant but likely surmountable with sufficient engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses an important problem in deep learning optimization. If successful, it could significantly improve training stability and convergence, especially in challenging non-smooth loss landscapes. The Edge-of-Stability phenomenon is a recognized issue in current deep learning practice, and better theoretical understanding coupled with practical solutions would be valuable to the field. The approach directly bridges theory (curvature analysis) and practice (optimizer implementation), which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals. The potential impact extends beyond just faster training to potentially better generalization, which could benefit a wide range of deep learning applications. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's aim to derive theoretical convergence bounds, further strengthening the theory-practice connection."
