    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The RobustPrompt idea aligns excellently with the task description's focus on robustness in few-shot learning for foundation models. It directly addresses the workshop's core questions about 'evaluating robustness of few-shot models' and 'novel methods to improve few-shot robustness.' The self-diagnostic capabilities specifically target the task's concern with models recognizing their own limitations and potential failures. The proposal also connects to the 'reimagining human-in-the-loop' topic by creating guardrails that improve robustness while maintaining performance. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address the use of unlabeled data, which is one aspect mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The RobustPrompt idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation clearly establishes the problem of few-shot learning failures under distribution shifts. The main idea articulates a specific two-stage prompt architecture with self-diagnostic capabilities and explains how it works during inference. The concept of boundary conditions and failure indicators is introduced, though it could benefit from a concrete example of what these look like in practice. The integration of counterfactual reasoning is mentioned but not fully elaborated. Overall, the core concept is well-defined and understandable, with only minor ambiguities around the specific implementation details."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The RobustPrompt approach offers notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. The idea of embedding self-diagnostic capabilities directly into prompts represents an innovative approach to robustness. While meta-prompting and counterfactual reasoning are not new concepts individually, their integration into a two-stage architecture specifically for robustness in few-shot learning appears to be a novel contribution. The approach of having models evaluate their own solutions against boundary conditions is particularly innovative. However, it builds upon existing work in prompt engineering and self-verification rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which prevents it from scoring in the highest range."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The RobustPrompt idea is highly feasible with current technology and resources. Its key strength is that it requires no model modifications and can be adopted across any foundation model that supports in-context learning. This makes implementation straightforward and accessible. The approach leverages existing capabilities of foundation models (following instructions, reasoning about their own outputs) rather than requiring new architectural developments. The two-stage prompt structure can be implemented immediately with current prompting techniques. The only minor challenge might be in designing effective boundary conditions and failure indicators for diverse tasks, but this appears to be a matter of prompt engineering rather than a fundamental feasibility issue."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The RobustPrompt idea addresses a critical problem in the deployment of foundation models: their unpredictable behavior when encountering unexpected inputs. This has significant implications for safety, reliability, and responsible AI deployment. By enabling models to recognize when they might fail and adjust accordingly, the approach could substantially improve the practical utility of few-shot learning in real-world applications. The significance is enhanced by the method's applicability across any foundation model without modification. While the impact could be substantial, it's not clear if this approach alone would solve the deeper issues of model robustness under extreme distribution shifts or for highly complex tasks, which prevents it from receiving the highest possible score."
