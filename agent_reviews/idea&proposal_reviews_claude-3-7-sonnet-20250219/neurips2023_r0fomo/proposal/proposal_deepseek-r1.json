    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of adversarial robustness in few-shot learning with large foundation models, which is a central theme in the R0-FoMo workshop description. The Meta-APP framework elaborates on the initial idea of meta-adversarial prompt perturbation, maintaining consistency with the core concept while providing detailed methodology. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, particularly building upon works like StyleAdv and Long-term Cross Adversarial Training, while addressing the key challenge of data scarcity in adversarial training mentioned in the literature review. The experimental design includes relevant datasets (GLUE, MMLU, miniImageNet) that align with the workshop's focus on both NLP and vision domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The three-stage framework (meta-training, synthetic example generation, and robust fine-tuning) is well-defined with appropriate mathematical formulations. The objectives, methods, and evaluation protocols are explicitly stated. The technical formulations are presented with precision, making the approach understandable to those familiar with the field. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for how the perturbation generator transfers across tasks could be more explicitly defined, and (2) the relationship between the KL-divergence loss and traditional adversarial training objectives could be further elaborated to strengthen the theoretical foundations."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining meta-learning with adversarial training specifically for few-shot learning scenarios. The Meta-APP framework introduces several innovative elements: (1) a meta-learned perturbation generator that creates task-agnostic adversarial prompts, (2) leveraging unlabeled data for adversarial example synthesis, and (3) a hybrid loss function that balances task accuracy with robustness. While individual components like meta-learning and adversarial training exist in prior work (as seen in StyleAdv and Long-term Cross Adversarial Training from the literature review), their integration for prompt-based few-shot learning represents a fresh approach. However, the proposal shares conceptual similarities with existing adversarial meta-learning methods, which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature. The novelty lies more in the specific application to prompt perturbations and the three-stage framework rather than in fundamentally new theoretical insights."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-formulated mathematical expressions and a methodologically rigorous approach. The three-stage framework is built on established principles from meta-learning and adversarial training, with clear optimization objectives. The use of KL-divergence for consistency loss is theoretically justified, and the experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics. The proposal acknowledges the trade-off between accuracy and robustness, addressing it through the hybrid loss function. The validation protocol is comprehensive, covering various few-shot settings and attack scenarios. However, there are minor areas that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) the convergence properties of the meta-learning procedure could be more thoroughly analyzed, and (2) the theoretical guarantees for generalization across tasks could be strengthened. Overall, the technical foundations are solid, with only minor gaps in theoretical analysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation requirements. The three-stage framework builds upon existing techniques in meta-learning and adversarial training, making it implementable with current deep learning libraries. The use of a lightweight perturbation generator addresses computational concerns, and the claim that training time will remain within 20% of vanilla fine-tuning seems reasonable. The datasets and evaluation metrics are standard and accessible. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) meta-learning across diverse tasks can be computationally intensive and may require significant hyperparameter tuning, (2) generating effective adversarial examples in few-shot settings without overfitting is non-trivial, and (3) balancing the hybrid loss function parameters (λ) across different tasks may require careful calibration. While these challenges are manageable, they do introduce some uncertainty into the implementation process."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the field of robust few-shot learning with large foundation models, which has significant implications for deploying these models in high-stakes domains. The expected outcomes—15-20% improvement in adversarial accuracy and 30% reduction in generalization gap—would represent meaningful advances in model robustness. The work has clear practical relevance for applications in healthcare, legal analysis, and autonomous systems where reliability is crucial. The proposed evaluation protocols could establish new benchmarks for assessing robustness in few-shot learning scenarios. The integration of meta-learning with adversarial training also opens new research directions in the field. While the impact is substantial within the specific domain of few-shot robustness, it may not fundamentally transform the broader field of machine learning, which slightly limits its transformative potential. Nevertheless, the proposal addresses a pressing need identified in the workshop description and literature review, making it highly significant for responsible AI development."
