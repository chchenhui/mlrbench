        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayesian theory in interactive learning settings. It directly addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning using PAC-Bayesian bounds, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The proposal covers several key workshop themes: PAC-Bayesian analysis of exploration-exploitation trade-offs, handling distribution shifts via adapted bounds for non-stationary transitions, and developing a practical deep RL algorithm with theoretical guarantees. The idea's focus on sample efficiency also matches the workshop's concern about the cost of acquiring observations in interactive settings."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The proposal explains how PAC-Bayes theory will be used to quantify policy uncertainty and guide exploration. The mechanism for approximating a variational posterior over neural network policies and reformulating the bound as a tractable objective is outlined. However, some technical details could be more specific - for instance, the exact formulation of the PAC-Bayes bound to be used, the specific variational approximation technique, and how the posterior variance will be calculated in practice. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows notable originality in applying PAC-Bayesian theory specifically to guide exploration in reinforcement learning. While PAC-Bayes theory itself is established and has been applied to various learning settings, the integration with uncertainty-aware exploration in deep RL and the explicit minimization of PAC-Bayes bounds for policy optimization represents a fresh approach. The adaptation of bounds to handle non-stationary transitions is also innovative. However, there have been previous works connecting PAC-Bayes theory with RL and exploration strategies, so while this represents a valuable new combination and extension of existing concepts, it's not entirely groundbreaking."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing techniques. PAC-Bayesian theory provides established mathematical tools, and variational approximations for neural networks are well-developed. The proposal to guide exploration based on posterior variance is implementable. However, there are significant challenges: (1) computing and optimizing PAC-Bayes bounds for complex deep RL settings can be computationally intensive, (2) adapting the bounds for non-stationary transitions adds mathematical complexity, and (3) balancing theoretical guarantees with practical performance often requires careful engineering. These challenges are substantial but likely surmountable with sufficient expertise and computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning: sample efficiency with theoretical guarantees. If successful, it would provide both practical algorithms and theoretical understanding for more efficient RL in costly interactive settings like robotics. The potential impact is high because: (1) it bridges theory and practice in a way that's often missing in deep RL, (2) sample efficiency is crucial for real-world applications where data collection is expensive, and (3) the theoretical guarantees could enable safer deployment in sensitive domains. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that theoretical guarantees often come with assumptions that may not fully hold in complex environments, but the overall contribution to the field would still be substantial."
