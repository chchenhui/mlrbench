    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayesian theory in interactive learning settings. It directly addresses non-stationary contextual bandits, which is a core interactive learning problem involving exploration-exploitation trade-offs. The proposal explicitly develops PAC-Bayes bounds under distribution shift (non-stationarity), which is specifically mentioned as a topic of interest. The idea combines theoretical guarantees (time-uniform PAC-Bayes regret bounds) with practical algorithm development, matching the workshop's interest in both theoretical analysis and practical algorithm development. The only minor limitation preventing a perfect score is that it doesn't explicitly address deep learning methods, which is mentioned as one area of interest in the workshop scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (non-stationary contextual bandits), the proposed solution (dynamic data-dependent priors with sliding windows), and the expected theoretical and empirical contributions (time-uniform PAC-Bayes bounds and improved performance on non-stationary benchmarks). The three-step process of the algorithm is well-defined. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific form of the variational inference step, how the mixture of recent posteriors is weighted, and the precise mathematical formulation of the time-uniform PAC-Bayes regret bound. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The combination of PAC-Bayesian theory with adaptive, data-dependent priors for non-stationary bandits appears to be a fresh approach. The concept of using a sliding window of posteriors to form dynamic priors that adapt to distribution drift is innovative. The development of time-uniform PAC-Bayes regret bounds that explicitly account for prior shifts represents a theoretical advancement. While individual components (PAC-Bayes theory, contextual bandits, sliding windows for non-stationarity) exist in the literature, their integration in this specific manner appears novel. It's not entirely groundbreaking as it builds upon established frameworks, but it offers a meaningful new direction within this space."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible but with some implementation challenges. The algorithmic components (posterior updates, prior formation, action selection) are well-defined and implementable. PAC-Bayesian analysis techniques exist for similar settings, suggesting the theoretical analysis is achievable. Testing on synthetic and real non-stationary bandit benchmarks is practical. However, several challenges may arise: (1) the computational complexity of maintaining and updating posteriors over a sliding window could be high, (2) deriving tight PAC-Bayes bounds that explicitly account for distribution drift is mathematically challenging, and (3) the variational inference step might face convergence issues in practice. These considerations suggest moderate implementation challenges that would require careful algorithm design and theoretical analysis."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses an important problem with significant potential impact. Non-stationarity is a fundamental challenge in real-world interactive systems, and theoretical guarantees for such settings are valuable. The proposed approach could advance both the theoretical understanding of PAC-Bayesian methods for non-stationary environments and provide practical algorithms with improved performance. The time-uniform regret bounds could offer new insights into the trade-offs between adaptation and stability in changing environments. The work bridges theory and practice in a way that could influence both communities. While the impact might be primarily within the specialized field of PAC-Bayesian theory and contextual bandits rather than transforming broader machine learning, it represents a meaningful contribution to an important research direction identified by the workshop."
