        "justification": "The Fair Data Attribution Framework aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on 'Data Attribution, Interpretability, and Data Marketplaces.' It directly addresses the need for 'efficient techniques for attributing model outputs to specific training data' and 'economic models for data pricing and the design of data marketplaces that ensure fair compensation.' The proposal also touches on copyright issues, which is another key topic in the workshop. The framework's comprehensive approach to attribution at different granularities (exact matching, stylistic influence, conceptual attribution) demonstrates a thorough understanding of the workshop's goals regarding attribution challenges in foundation models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, motivation, and proposed solution. The framework's components are defined with sufficient detail - including influence functions, confidence scoring mechanisms, and a layered attribution system. The practical implementation aspects (tooling for developers and API for content creators) are also clearly outlined. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how the influence functions would be specifically modified for large-scale models and how the confidence scoring mechanism would quantify attribution certainty in practice. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining model-based and dataset-based attribution techniques into a comprehensive system. The layered approach to attribution at different granularities (exact content, stylistic influence, conceptual) is particularly innovative. However, influence functions and attribution methods have been explored in machine learning literature before, though not necessarily at the scale of foundation models or with the specific combination proposed here. The integration with data marketplaces and compensation models adds a fresh perspective, but the core technical approaches build upon existing concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. While influence functions exist in principle, scaling them to foundation models with billions of parameters and massive training datasets presents significant computational hurdles. The proposal acknowledges this by mentioning 'minimal computational overhead,' but achieving accurate attribution with reasonable computational resources remains difficult. The layered attribution system spanning exact matches to conceptual influences is ambitious and may require substantial algorithmic innovations. The confidence scoring mechanism for quantifying attribution certainty also presents technical challenges, especially for more abstract forms of influence. While the overall direction is implementable, considerable research and engineering effort would be required to make it practical for real-world foundation models."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical and timely problem in AI development. As foundation models become more prevalent and copyright disputes increase, attribution mechanisms are essential for the sustainable development of AI. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: legal (addressing copyright concerns), economic (enabling fair compensation through data marketplaces), ethical (recognizing content creators' contributions), and technical (advancing our understanding of how foundation models utilize training data). The framework could fundamentally change how data is valued and compensated in AI development, potentially establishing new standards for the industry. The significance is heightened by recent legal challenges to foundation models regarding copyright infringement."
