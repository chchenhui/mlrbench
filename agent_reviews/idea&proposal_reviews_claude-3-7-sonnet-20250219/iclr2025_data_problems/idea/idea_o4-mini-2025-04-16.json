        "justification": "The InfluenceSpace idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on data curation for foundation models. It directly addresses the 'Data Collection and Curation for Foundation Models' topic by proposing a principled approach to filtering and balancing multi-modal training data. The proposal specifically targets redundancy, noise, and bias in large-scale datasets - key challenges highlighted in the workshop description. The method also connects to fairness considerations mentioned in the 'Data and Society' topic by identifying and up-weighting underrepresented but high-influence clusters. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address copyright issues or data attribution, which are also workshop themes."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is generally well-articulated with a clear two-stage pipeline: (1) clustering data into semantically coherent groups using cross-modal embeddings, and (2) computing influence scores to guide pruning and reweighting. The motivation and evaluation approach are also clearly stated. However, some technical details remain ambiguous - for instance, how exactly the 'amortized influence scores' are calculated using 'low-rank Hessian approximations and mini-batch gradient samples' could be elaborated further. The proposal would benefit from more specificity about the clustering methodology and influence computation algorithms. Additionally, the exact metrics for measuring 'bias mitigation' in the evaluation are not fully defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The approach offers significant novelty by combining influence functions (typically used for understanding individual training examples) with clustering techniques to make influence-based curation scalable for foundation models. While influence functions themselves are not new, their application to multi-modal foundation model training data at scale, particularly with the hierarchical clustering approach, represents an innovative direction. The idea of iteratively pruning and reweighting based on influence scores across modalities is a fresh perspective on data curation. The combination of semantic clustering with influence metrics creates a new framework that bridges traditional data cleaning with principled optimization approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this approach faces several challenges. Computing influence functions typically requires access to Hessian matrices, which are computationally expensive for large foundation models. While the proposal mentions using low-rank approximations and mini-batch sampling to address this, these techniques may still struggle at true foundation model scale (billions of parameters). The cross-modal clustering step is also computationally intensive. Additionally, the iterative nature of the pipeline could significantly increase overall training time. The approach would likely work well for medium-sized models but may require substantial engineering and computational resources to scale to the largest foundation models. The evaluation on vision-language benchmarks seems feasible, but the full pipeline implementation presents significant computational hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "If successful, this research could have substantial impact on foundation model development. Data curation is a critical bottleneck in FM training, and principled approaches to reduce data volume while maintaining or improving performance would address significant industry and research challenges. The potential benefits include reduced computational costs, faster training, improved model robustness, and better fairness properties - all key concerns in modern AI development. The approach could establish a new paradigm for data-centric AI that moves beyond heuristic filtering to influence-driven curation. The significance is particularly high given the increasing size of multi-modal datasets and the growing importance of efficient, fair AI systems."
