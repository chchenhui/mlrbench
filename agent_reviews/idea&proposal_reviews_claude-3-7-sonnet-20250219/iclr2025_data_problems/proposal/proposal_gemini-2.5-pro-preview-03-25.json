    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the DATA-FM workshop's focus on data curation for foundation models, particularly in multi-modal settings. The InfluenceSpace pipeline implements the hierarchical influence-driven curation approach outlined in the research idea, with detailed explanations of the two-stage process involving cross-modal clustering and influence scoring. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing DataInf for efficient influence estimation techniques, HEMM for evaluation frameworks, Chameleon for fairness considerations, and FLAVA as a relevant multi-modal foundation model. The methodology section provides comprehensive technical details that align with both the research idea and the challenges identified in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the research idea mentions iterating the process, the proposal could have elaborated more on the specific iteration strategy in the methodology section."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally very clear and well-structured. It provides a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the proposed methods understandable. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the evaluation metrics are well-defined. The proposal uses appropriate technical terminology consistent with the field. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for integrating fairness considerations into the influence scoring could be more precisely defined with specific formulations; (2) The relationship between the clustering approach and the subsequent influence estimation could be more explicitly connected in terms of computational workflow; (3) Some of the mathematical notation, particularly around the Hessian approximation methods, could be more thoroughly explained for readers less familiar with influence functions. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to data curation for multi-modal foundation models. The key innovation lies in the hierarchical cluster-level influence analysis, which addresses the computational intractability of point-wise influence estimation at scale. This represents a significant departure from traditional data curation methods that rely on simple heuristics or metadata-based filtering. The integration of cross-modal semantic clustering with amortized influence estimation is particularly innovative. The proposal also introduces novel adaptations of influence functions to the multi-modal domain and cluster-level analysis, extending beyond the point-wise approach in works like DataInf. The fairness-aware curation component, which considers under-represented groups during the up-weighting process, adds another layer of novelty. While individual components (clustering, influence functions) exist in prior work, their combination and adaptation to multi-modal FM data curation at scale represents a fresh approach. The proposal could have scored higher if it had developed entirely new theoretical foundations for influence estimation rather than adapting existing ones."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall. The theoretical foundations of influence functions are well-established in the literature (Koh & Liang, 2017), and the adaptations to cluster-level analysis are logically derived. The mathematical formulations for cluster gradients, validation gradients, and influence scores are coherent and follow from established principles. The proposed Hessian approximation methods (FIM, low-rank, diagonal) are grounded in prior work. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The theoretical guarantees for the cluster-level influence approximation compared to true influence are not fully developed; (2) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenges of applying influence functions to non-convex deep learning objectives; (3) The exact algorithm for integrating the fairness considerations into the influence scoring lacks formal specification. Additionally, while the proposal mentions using pre-trained embeddings for clustering, it doesn't thoroughly address potential biases inherited from these embeddings. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible approach, though with significant implementation challenges. On the positive side, the researchers have identified practical datasets (LAION, CC3M, CC12M) and models (CLIP, FLAVA) to work with, and have outlined reasonable computational approximations to make influence estimation more tractable. The use of mini-batch sampling and amortized computation are sensible strategies to improve efficiency. However, several feasibility concerns remain: (1) Even with the proposed approximations, computing influence scores for large clusters across massive datasets will require substantial computational resources; (2) The iterative nature of the pipeline (re-clustering, re-scoring) multiplies the computational demands; (3) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of efficiently inverting or approximating the Hessian for very large models; (4) The evaluation on fairness metrics requires additional data about demographic attributes which may not be readily available in the proposed datasets. While the researchers propose using subsets of larger datasets (10M-100M scale) to demonstrate the approach, scaling to full FM training data (billions of examples) remains a significant challenge. The proposal would benefit from more detailed resource estimates and potential fallback strategies if computational constraints prove prohibitive."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in foundation model development: efficient and principled data curation for multi-modal training. This is highly significant for several reasons: (1) It directly tackles the computational inefficiency of training large models on massive, noisy datasets; (2) It provides a principled approach to data selection beyond simple heuristics; (3) It integrates fairness considerations into the curation process, potentially addressing bias issues; (4) If successful, it could significantly reduce the resources required for FM training, making it more accessible and environmentally sustainable. The work aligns perfectly with the DATA-FM workshop's focus on data collection, curation, and societal impact. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in industry, where efficient data curation could substantially reduce training costs. The proposal could have scored higher if it had more explicitly quantified the expected improvements in training efficiency or fairness metrics based on preliminary results or theoretical bounds. Nevertheless, the significance of addressing data curation at scale for multi-modal FMs is undeniable in the current AI landscape."
