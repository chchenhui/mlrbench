    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Data Collection and Curation for Foundation Models' topic from the workshop call, focusing on practical strategies for curating data tailored to FM training. The proposal expands on the concise research idea by developing a comprehensive two-stage pipeline for influence-driven curation of multi-modal data. It builds upon the literature review, particularly extending Kwon et al.'s (2023) work on influence functions to multi-modal contexts and addressing fairness concerns highlighted in Erfanian et al.'s (2024) research. The proposal also incorporates evaluation approaches that align with HEMM's holistic evaluation framework mentioned in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes challenges in integrating modalities, the proposal focuses more on curation than on modality integration challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations that make the methodology transparent and reproducible. The hierarchical clustering approach, influence function computation, and iterative curation process are all well-defined. The evaluation protocol is comprehensive, covering multiple benchmarks and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact relationship between cluster influence and individual data point influence could be more precisely defined, (2) the process for determining the optimal parameters (α, τ, δ, γ, etc.) is not fully specified, and (3) some of the fairness adjustment mechanisms could be explained in greater detail, particularly how underrepresented clusters are identified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by extending influence function techniques to multi-modal data curation, which represents a significant advancement over current approaches. The hierarchical clustering approach to manage computational complexity is innovative, as is the integration of fairness considerations into the influence-based framework. The proposal builds upon existing work (particularly DataInf) but extends it in meaningful ways for multi-modal contexts. However, while the individual components (influence functions, hierarchical clustering, fairness adjustments) are not entirely new, their combination and application to multi-modal foundation model curation is novel. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more fundamentally new algorithmic approaches rather than primarily combining and extending existing techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The technical foundations of the proposal are solid and well-justified. The influence function approximations are based on established mathematical principles, and the hierarchical clustering approach is grounded in proven techniques. The low-rank Hessian approximation and amortized computation strategies are appropriate for addressing the computational challenges. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive and includes appropriate baselines and metrics. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations and includes ablation studies to assess the contribution of different components. The mathematical formulations appear correct and are clearly presented. However, there are some assumptions that could benefit from further justification, such as the effectiveness of the joint embedding approach for capturing cross-modal relationships and the stability of influence estimates across training iterations. Additionally, while the proposal discusses fairness adjustments, the theoretical guarantees for bias mitigation could be more rigorously established."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant computational resources and careful implementation. The hierarchical clustering and amortized influence computation are designed to make the approach scalable to large datasets, which is crucial for foundation model training. The use of pre-trained models for embedding generation is practical, and the iterative refinement process allows for gradual improvement. However, there are several implementation challenges: (1) computing influence functions for very large models remains computationally intensive even with the proposed approximations, (2) the quality of the clustering depends heavily on the initial embeddings, which may not perfectly capture cross-modal relationships, (3) the iterative process could be time-consuming for very large datasets, and (4) the approach requires access to validation sets that are representative of downstream tasks, which may not always be available. These challenges do not render the approach infeasible but will require careful management and potentially additional optimizations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in foundation model development: the efficient and principled curation of multi-modal training data. If successful, this research could significantly impact how foundation models are trained, potentially reducing computational costs, improving model performance, and enhancing fairness. The expected outcomes include both methodological contributions (hierarchical influence computation techniques) and practical applications (resource-efficient FM development, data quality assessment tools). The approach directly addresses several key challenges in the field, including computational efficiency, data quality, and fairness. The potential for environmental sustainability through reduced computation is particularly significant given the growing concerns about AI's carbon footprint. The proposal could have broader impacts beyond multi-modal foundation models, potentially influencing data curation practices across machine learning. While the impact may not be transformative of the entire field, it represents a significant advancement in an important area of research."
