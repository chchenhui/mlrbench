    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for AI methods in cell and gene therapy development as specified in the task description, focusing on both the Application Track (AI for cell and gene therapies) and ML Track (foundation models employing multi-modal perturbation). The proposal faithfully implements the main idea of developing a foundation model that integrates perturbation data with multi-modal readouts, using the hybrid architecture combining transformers and GNNs as outlined in the research idea. It incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including multi-modal integration approaches (Lit Review #1, #3, #4), perturbation prediction (Lit Review #2), CRISPR off-target prediction (Lit Review #6), and active learning strategies (Lit Review #10). The proposal also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as data integration complexity, model interpretability, limited annotated data, and generalization across cell types."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and well-defined. The technical approach is described in detail, with clear explanations of the model architecture, pre-training strategy, fine-tuning approach, and evaluation methods. The proposal uses appropriate technical terminology and provides sufficient context for understanding complex concepts. However, there are a few areas where additional clarity would be beneficial: (1) some technical details in the cross-modal integration module could be more precisely formulated, (2) the specific active learning algorithms could be more explicitly defined, and (3) the proposal could more clearly delineate which parts of the model would be pre-trained versus fine-tuned. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in several aspects. The IntegraGene model represents a novel integration of existing techniques (transformers, GNNs, cross-modal attention) specifically tailored for the cell and gene therapy domain. The combination of perturbation data with multi-modal biological readouts in a unified foundation model architecture is innovative, as most existing models focus on either descriptive tasks or small molecule responses rather than complex genetic interventions. The active learning framework for efficient fine-tuning is also a valuable contribution. However, the core technical components (transformer encoders, GNNs, cross-modal attention, active learning) are established methods adapted rather than fundamentally new approaches. The proposal builds upon existing work in biological foundation models (e.g., MAMMAL, scMMGPT) rather than proposing entirely new architectures or learning paradigms. While the application domain and specific integration approach are novel, the underlying technical innovations are incremental rather than revolutionary."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established machine learning techniques and biological principles. The model architecture is theoretically well-founded, drawing on proven approaches like transformers for sequence data and GNNs for network data, with cross-modal attention for integration. The pre-training and fine-tuning strategies are based on sound principles from transfer learning and active learning literature. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, with appropriate metrics and baselines. The proposal also acknowledges technical challenges and proposes reasonable solutions. The formulation of cross-modal attention is technically correct, though somewhat simplified. The data preprocessing steps are appropriate for the different modalities. However, there are some areas where additional technical details would strengthen the soundness: (1) more specific details on loss functions for the different training objectives, (2) more rigorous treatment of potential data biases and their mitigation, and (3) more detailed discussion of computational complexity and optimization strategies. Overall, the proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations with minor gaps."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, though with some significant challenges. The data sources identified for pre-training (DepMap, GTEx, etc.) are publicly available and appropriate for the task. The model architecture, while complex, builds on established components that have been successfully implemented in prior work. The active learning approach is a practical solution to the limited labeled data challenge. However, several feasibility concerns exist: (1) The computational resources required for pre-training a large multi-modal foundation model could be substantial, potentially requiring specialized hardware. (2) Acquiring sufficient high-quality perturbation-response data for fine-tuning may be challenging, especially for newer therapeutic modalities. (3) The integration of diverse data types with different scales, noise levels, and structures presents technical challenges that may require significant engineering effort. (4) The timeline for implementing and validating such a complex system is not specified but would likely be substantial. While these challenges are significant, they are not insurmountable given appropriate resources and expertise, making the proposal challenging but feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need in the rapidly evolving field of cell and gene therapies. If successful, IntegraGene would have substantial impact on multiple fronts: (1) Accelerating therapy development by reducing experimental cycles and costs, a major bottleneck in bringing new treatments to patients. (2) Improving therapeutic safety by better predicting off-target effects, a critical concern for regulatory approval. (3) Enhancing efficacy through more accurate prediction of cellular responses to genetic interventions. (4) Advancing the state of multi-modal foundation models in biology, contributing methodological innovations that could benefit other biomedical applications. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging AI and new drug modalities, with potential applications beyond cell and gene therapies to other modalities mentioned in the task description (mRNA vaccines, delivery systems). The expected quantitative improvements (10-15% over baselines) would represent meaningful advances in predictive performance for therapeutic applications. The open-source release of the model would further amplify its impact across the research community. Overall, the potential significance of this work is very high, addressing both immediate practical needs in therapy development and advancing the broader field of AI in biomedicine."
