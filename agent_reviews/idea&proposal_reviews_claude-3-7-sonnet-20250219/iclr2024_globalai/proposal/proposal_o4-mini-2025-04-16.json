    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for globally-inclusive AI systems that respect cultural sensibilities as outlined in the task description. The proposal implements the Cultural Calibration Framework exactly as described in the research idea, with the three core components (Cultural Value Vectors, Differential Testing Protocol, and Adaptive Weighting Mechanism) fully developed. The literature review's concerns about Western-centric biases in AI systems (Peters & Carman 2024, Tao et al. 2023, Bayramli et al. 2025) are explicitly acknowledged and addressed. The proposal also incorporates the 'cultural prompting' strategy mentioned by Tao et al. and expands upon the evaluation methodologies discussed in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical components are explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The four-part methodology is particularly well-defined, with clear explanations of data collection, cultural vector construction, testing protocols, and adaptive mechanisms. The experimental design section provides concrete details about implementation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact process for recruiting and training cultural annotators could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the scoring network g_φ and the cultural vectors could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'logit adjustment') might be challenging for non-technical stakeholders to understand without additional explanation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers significant innovation in several aspects. The Cultural Value Vectors provide a novel mathematical representation of cultural dimensions that goes beyond simple demographic categorizations. The Differential Testing Protocol introduces new metrics specifically designed for cultural evaluation, particularly the Cultural Relevance Score and Fairness Gap measurements. The Adaptive Weighting Mechanism, especially the conditional logit adjustment approach, represents an innovative technical solution to the problem of cultural calibration. The integration of participatory feedback loops with computational methods is also a fresh approach. While the proposal builds upon existing work (e.g., Hofstede's cultural dimensions, techniques from the literature review), it combines and extends these elements in original ways. The proposal is not entirely groundbreaking, as it leverages some established methods, but its comprehensive framework and technical implementations represent substantial innovation in addressing cultural inclusivity in AI."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The mathematical formulations for Cultural Value Vectors and the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism are well-defined and theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical analyses. However, there are some limitations to its soundness: (1) The reliance on Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework, which has been criticized for oversimplification and Western bias, could be problematic without addressing these critiques; (2) The assumption that cultures can be neatly categorized into eight geographic regions may not capture intra-regional diversity; (3) The proposal doesn't fully address potential conflicts between cultural authenticity and other ethical considerations (e.g., when certain cultural values might conflict with universal human rights); (4) Some technical claims, such as the expected 20% reduction in performance gaps, would benefit from more theoretical justification. While these issues don't fundamentally undermine the approach, they do suggest areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible implementation plan but faces several significant challenges. On the positive side, the technical components (e.g., fine-tuning existing models, implementing logit adjustments) are achievable with current AI capabilities and the specified hardware (8× NVIDIA A100 GPUs). The phased approach to implementation is reasonable. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The annotation process requires expert annotators from eight diverse regions, which would be resource-intensive and logistically complex; (2) The continuous participatory feedback loop would require sustained engagement from cultural stakeholders, which may be difficult to maintain; (3) The creation of culturally diverse datasets across multiple modalities (text and images) for eight regions is a massive undertaking; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address potential computational costs of the adaptive weighting mechanism during inference. While the core technical approach is implementable, the scale and complexity of the cultural data collection and annotation process present substantial practical challenges that may require significant resources and time to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI development practices with potentially far-reaching impact. Cultural bias in generative AI is a pressing issue that affects billions of users worldwide, and this framework offers a systematic approach to mitigating these biases. The significance is evident in several dimensions: (1) Scientific advancement - the proposal introduces novel metrics and methods for measuring and addressing cultural bias; (2) Practical utility - the open-source framework and benchmark would provide concrete tools for researchers and industry practitioners; (3) Social impact - successful implementation could significantly improve AI accessibility and relevance for underrepresented populations; (4) Policy implications - the framework could inform standards and best practices for culturally responsible AI deployment. The proposal directly addresses the power imbalances in cultural production highlighted in the task description and offers a path toward more equitable AI systems. The potential to transform how generative AI represents diverse cultures makes this work highly significant to the field and society at large."
