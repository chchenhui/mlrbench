        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop theme of 'Global AI Cultures' by developing a framework to make AI systems more culturally inclusive. The Cultural Calibration Framework (CCF) proposed matches exactly with the research idea, incorporating all three components mentioned: Cultural Value Vectors, Differential Testing Protocol, and Adaptive Weighting Mechanism. The proposal thoroughly engages with the literature, citing key works like Tao et al. (2023) on cultural prompting and Bayramli et al. (2025) on cultural inclusivity in diffusion models. It addresses all major challenges identified in the literature review, including data representation bias, evaluation metrics, cross-cultural generalization, ethical considerations, and stakeholder engagement. The only minor inconsistency is that some referenced papers in the proposal (e.g., Henrich et al., 2010) weren't included in the provided literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and broken down into four concrete goals. The methodology section is particularly strong, with detailed explanations of each component of the framework, including mathematical formulations that add precision. The experimental validation plan is specific, with clear metrics and evaluation criteria. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) some mathematical notations (e.g., partial derivatives in CVV formulation) are introduced without full explanation of their meaning; (2) the relationship between the Context Detection Module and the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism could be more explicitly defined; and (3) the proposal mentions 'Figure 1' but doesn't actually include the figure, which would have enhanced clarity. Overall, despite these minor issues, the proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality in several aspects. The Cultural Value Vectors (CVVs) represent a novel approach to quantifying cultural attributes, extending beyond existing frameworks like Hofstede's cultural dimensions. The mathematical formulation for cultural representation is innovative, particularly the inclusion of uncertainty bounds derived from cultural entropy calculations to avoid oversimplification. The Adaptive Weighting Mechanism that dynamically recalibrates model weights during inference based on cultural context is a fresh approach not commonly seen in current literature. The integration of participatory action research with computational methods also represents an innovative methodological approach. While some elements build upon existing work (e.g., cultural prompting from Tao et al., 2023), the proposal synthesizes and extends these concepts in original ways. The framework as a whole offers a comprehensive and novel approach to addressing cultural biases in generative AI, going beyond the ad hoc solutions mentioned in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The mathematical formulations for Cultural Value Vectors, Differential Testing Protocol, and Adaptive Weighting Mechanism are well-developed and technically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate controls, baseline comparators, and statistical analyses (e.g., ANCOVA to isolate cultural variables from confounding factors). However, there are some areas where additional justification or clarification would strengthen the technical soundness: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address how the CVVs would handle cultures that evolve over time or have significant internal variations; (2) the contrastive loss function for the Context Detection Module assumes clear boundaries between cultural clusters, which may not always be realistic; and (3) while the proposal mentions mitigating risks of cultural essentialism, it doesn't provide detailed mechanisms for doing so. Additionally, some of the performance targets (e.g., achieving Dr > 0.75) would benefit from more justification for why these specific thresholds were chosen. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and well-grounded in both technical and cultural theory."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach in many respects but faces significant implementation challenges. On the positive side, the technical components (CVVs, DTP, AWM) are clearly defined with specific implementation steps, and the evaluation plan includes concrete metrics and experimental designs. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes strategies to address them. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The scale of data collection is ambitious - partnering with 20 cultural groups across six continents, surveying 500+ participants per group, and curating 50,000 culturally annotated prompts requires substantial resources and coordination; (2) The stakeholder validation involving 200+ anthropologists and community representatives in double-blind trials presents logistical challenges; (3) The longitudinal testing over 18 months may face participant retention issues; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address computational resource requirements for implementing the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism at scale. While the technical components are theoretically implementable, the scope and scale of the proposed work would require significant resources, time, and cross-disciplinary expertise that may be difficult to coordinate in practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in AI ethics and development with potentially far-reaching implications. By creating a systematic framework for cultural calibration in generative AI, it directly tackles the problem of Western-centric bias that currently dominates AI systems - an issue affecting the vast majority (85%) of the world's population according to the proposal. The significance spans multiple dimensions: (1) Technical - introducing novel methods for quantifying and addressing cultural representation in AI; (2) Ethical - promoting epistemic justice by elevating non-Western epistemologies; (3) Practical - improving AI system performance for users across diverse cultural contexts; (4) Policy - informing governance frameworks for culturally inclusive AI development. The proposal explicitly connects to broader societal goals, including the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 16 on reducing inequalities. The expected outcomes include concrete deliverables (publicly accessible CVVs, benchmarking tools, algorithm implementations) that could have lasting impact on the field. The industry partnerships and policy collaborations mentioned would further amplify the significance by translating research into real-world applications. Overall, this work has the potential to fundamentally reshape how generative AI systems are developed and evaluated from a cultural perspective."
