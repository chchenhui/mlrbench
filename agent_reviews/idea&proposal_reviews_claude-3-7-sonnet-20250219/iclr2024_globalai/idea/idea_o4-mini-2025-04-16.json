        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The GlobalCultureScore framework aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the need for 'scalable cultural representation evaluations' mentioned in the themes, proposing a concrete pipeline to test cross-cultural performance. The idea also touches on 'cultural metrics such as representation, quality, impact, and inclusion at scale' through its multi-dimensional scoring approach. The framework's feedback loop with users across multiple countries addresses the task's concern for understanding cultural values embedded in AI systems. The only minor gap is that while it focuses on evaluation, it doesn't fully address how to incorporate these insights into the initial training process."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a three-module pipeline with specific components and methodologies. The purpose, structure, and expected outcomes are well-articulated. Each module has a clear function: lexicon extraction, multi-dimensional scoring with specific metrics, and a feedback mechanism. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as how exactly the 'cultural sensitivity' scoring would be implemented, or how the weights in the feedback loop would be determined mathematically. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The GlobalCultureScore framework offers a fresh approach by combining several existing techniques into a comprehensive evaluation system specifically for cross-cultural AI assessment. The idea of automatically mining region-specific lexicons and using them for evaluation is innovative, as is the multi-dimensional scoring approach that considers representation, semantic alignment, and cultural sensitivity simultaneously. However, some components build upon existing methods in fairness evaluation and multilingual NLP rather than introducing completely new techniques. The crowdsourcing approach for calibration, while practical, follows established methodologies in the field."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Creating reliable cultural lexicons would require significant expertise and validation across diverse regions. The multi-dimensional scoring system is technically implementable but would require careful design to ensure metrics truly capture cultural nuances rather than superficial patterns. The most challenging aspect is the feedback loop requiring user studies across 10+ countries, which would demand substantial resources, coordination, and time. Additionally, defining what constitutes a 'stereotype' or 'taboo topic' varies significantly across cultures, making the cultural sensitivity scoring particularly difficult to standardize. These challenges make the implementation demanding but not impossible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current AI evaluation practices. As AI systems are deployed globally, the lack of culturally-aware evaluation metrics represents a significant blind spot that could lead to harmful biases, misrepresentations, and reduced utility for non-Western users. The GlobalCultureScore framework could have far-reaching impact by providing developers with actionable metrics to improve cultural inclusivity, potentially influencing how major AI systems are developed and deployed worldwide. The significance is heightened by the increasing global adoption of generative AI systems and growing concerns about their cultural biases. This work could establish new standards for responsible AI development across cultural contexts."
