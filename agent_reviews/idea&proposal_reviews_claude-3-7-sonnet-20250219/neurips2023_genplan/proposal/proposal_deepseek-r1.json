        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on generalization in sequential decision-making by proposing a neuro-symbolic framework that bridges planning and reinforcement learning. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the hierarchical planning structure, meta-learned sub-policies, bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, and formal verification. It also builds upon the literature review by extending concepts from the Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer and VisualPredicator while addressing the identified challenges of sample efficiency, symbolic-neural alignment, and cross-domain generalization. The experimental design with ProcTHOR and MetaWorld benchmarks is appropriate for evaluating generalization capabilities as required by the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The three-layer architecture is well-defined, and the mathematical formulations of bi-level optimization and contrastive meta-learning provide precise technical details. The experimental design section clearly outlines benchmarks, baselines, metrics, and training protocols. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for how the LLM-guided repair module interfaces with the symbolic planner could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the contrastive learning objective and the meta-RL objective could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., ASNet datasets) are mentioned without sufficient context for readers unfamiliar with the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements into a cohesive framework. The integration of bi-level optimization for symbolic-neural alignment, contrastive meta-learning for disentangled skill representation, and LLM-guided plan repair represents a novel approach to cross-domain generalization. The proposal extends beyond existing neuro-symbolic methods like Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer by adding formal verification and meta-learning components. However, many of the individual components (meta-RL, contrastive learning, LLM-guided refinement, temporal logic verification) have been explored in prior work, and the proposal primarily innovates through their integration rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The disentanglement of task-invariant and task-specific latent factors is perhaps the most novel technical contribution, but similar approaches exist in other domains of machine learning."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The bi-level optimization formulation for aligning symbolic and neural components is mathematically well-defined, and the contrastive meta-learning objective is properly formulated. The use of linear temporal logic for verification is appropriate and well-established in the formal methods literature. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics for evaluation. The proposal also acknowledges theoretical contributions, including bounds on bi-level optimization gap and disentanglement efficacy. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further justification: (1) the assumption that LLM-guided repair will effectively address constraint violations needs stronger theoretical backing, (2) the specific form of the adaptation operator U in the meta-RL objective is not fully specified, and (3) the claim of 15% improvement over baselines would benefit from preliminary results or stronger theoretical justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a complex system with multiple interacting components that, while theoretically sound, may face implementation challenges. The feasibility concerns include: (1) Meta-training on 50+ procedurally generated environments requires substantial computational resources and expertise in meta-RL, which is notoriously difficult to tune. (2) The bi-level optimization between symbolic and neural components is computationally intensive and may not converge efficiently. (3) The LLM-guided repair module depends on the quality and reliability of LLM outputs, which can be inconsistent. (4) Formal verification of plans with neural components is challenging and may not scale to complex environments. (5) The integration of all these components (meta-RL, symbolic planning, verification, LLM repair) requires expertise across multiple AI subfields. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively suggest that full implementation of the proposed system would require significant resources and may need to be scaled back to a more focused subset of components for initial development."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: bridging symbolic planning and reinforcement learning for generalizable sequential decision-making. If successful, this work would make significant contributions to both theoretical understanding and practical applications. The theoretical contributions to bi-level optimization and neuro-symbolic alignment would advance our understanding of how to integrate symbolic and neural approaches. The practical impact on robotics and autonomous systems could be substantial, enabling more efficient transfer of skills across domains and reducing the need for extensive retraining. The framework directly addresses the workshop's focus on generalization in sequential decision-making and could foster collaboration between planning and RL communities. The expected improvements in zero-shot generalization and sample efficiency would represent meaningful progress on long-standing challenges. However, the significance is somewhat tempered by the incremental nature of some components and the potential implementation challenges that might limit real-world applicability in the near term."
