    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on generalization in sequential decision-making by proposing SYMERA, a neuro-symbolic framework that bridges reinforcement learning and symbolic planning. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the hierarchical planning approach, meta-learned sub-policies, bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, and formal verification. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing challenges identified in existing works like NeSyC and VisualPredicator, while proposing novel solutions for alignment between symbolic and neural components. The evaluation benchmarks (ProcTHOR, Meta-World) align with the cross-domain generalization goals mentioned in the idea. The only minor inconsistency is that the LLM-guided refinement mentioned in the idea is not extensively detailed in the proposal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical components are explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable to experts in the field. The hierarchical architecture is well-defined, with clear distinctions between the symbolic planning layer, meta-learned neural policy layer, and execution/monitoring layer. The bi-level optimization and contrastive meta-learning objectives are formally specified with equations that clarify their implementation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for translating between symbolic states and neural representations could be more explicitly defined, (2) the formal verification module's integration with the learning components could be more thoroughly explained, and (3) some technical terms are introduced without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with the specific subfields."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of symbolic planning with meta-reinforcement learning through a hierarchical architecture represents a fresh approach to cross-domain generalization. The bi-level optimization for aligning symbolic action schemas with neural policy capabilities addresses a critical gap in existing neuro-symbolic systems. The contrastive meta-learning approach for disentangling task-invariant and task-specific components is particularly innovative and distinguishes this work from prior approaches. The formal verification module that operates at both plan and execution levels is also novel in the context of meta-learning systems. While individual components like meta-learning, symbolic planning, and neuro-symbolic integration have been explored in prior work (as evidenced in the literature review), their specific combination and implementation in SYMERA represents a novel contribution to the field. The proposal builds upon existing frameworks like NeSyC and VisualPredicator but extends them in significant ways, particularly in the meta-learning and verification aspects."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations from both symbolic planning and reinforcement learning. The mathematical formulations for the bi-level optimization and contrastive meta-learning are technically correct and well-justified. The hierarchical architecture is logically structured and the integration of symbolic and neural components follows principles from neuro-symbolic AI. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the convergence properties of the bi-level optimization are not analyzed, which is important for ensuring the stability of the learning process; (2) the formal verification module makes claims about safety guarantees without providing detailed proofs or analyses of completeness; (3) the contrastive learning approach assumes that task-invariant and task-specific features can be cleanly separated, which may not always hold in complex environments; and (4) the proposal does not thoroughly address potential failure modes or limitations of the approach. While the methodology is generally sound, these gaps in rigorous analysis slightly reduce the overall soundness score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the individual components (symbolic planners, meta-learning algorithms, verification methods) have existing implementations that could be adapted. The evaluation benchmarks (ProcTHOR, Meta-World, MiniGrid) are established and accessible. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The bi-level optimization between symbolic and neural components is computationally intensive and may require significant resources to implement effectively; (2) The contrastive meta-learning approach requires diverse training environments, which may be difficult to create for meaningful cross-domain generalization; (3) The formal verification of neural policies in continuous state-action spaces remains an open challenge in the field; (4) The alignment between symbolic action schemas and neural policies may require extensive manual tuning despite the proposed automated methods; and (5) The expected performance improvements (25% improvement in zero-shot generalization, 50-80% reduction in sample complexity) are ambitious given the current state of the art. While the proposal acknowledges some of these challenges, it doesn't provide detailed strategies for overcoming them, making the full implementation moderately challenging within typical research timeframes."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: enabling effective cross-domain generalization in sequential decision-making. This problem is central to advancing AI systems toward more human-like capabilities and has significant implications for numerous applications. The integration of symbolic planning with meta-reinforcement learning could bridge a long-standing divide between these research communities, potentially leading to new paradigms in AI research. The practical applications are substantial and well-articulated, spanning robotics, personal assistants, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. If successful, the approach could dramatically reduce the need for task-specific training in deployed AI systems, addressing a major bottleneck in current applications. The formal verification component adds significant value by enhancing safety and reliability, which are critical for real-world deployment. The proposal also contributes to multiple research areas simultaneously (reinforcement learning, planning, meta-learning, neuro-symbolic AI, and verified AI), maximizing its potential impact. The expected outcomes are ambitious but would represent a significant advancement in the field if achieved."
