    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on generalization in sequential decision-making by proposing a neuro-symbolic framework that bridges the gap between data-driven RL and symbolic planning. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the original idea, including the bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, and neuro-symbolic plan repair. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing challenges identified in existing works, such as sample efficiency in meta-learning and alignment of symbolic and neural components. The methodology section thoroughly explains how these challenges will be tackled. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions formal verification as a challenge, the proposal could have elaborated more on specific verification techniques to be employed."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the algorithmic steps are broken down into comprehensible components. The technical approach is described in sufficient detail, explaining how the symbolic planner, meta-learned neural sub-policies, bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, and neuro-symbolic plan repair will work together. The evaluation metrics are also clearly defined. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the specific implementation details of the contrastive meta-learning algorithm could be more precisely defined, (2) the exact mechanism for LLM-guided refinement in plan repair could be elaborated, and (3) the proposal could provide more concrete examples of how the framework would handle specific cross-domain scenarios."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of several cutting-edge approaches in a unified framework. The combination of symbolic planning with meta-learned neural sub-policies represents an innovative approach to cross-domain generalization. The bi-level optimization for aligning symbolic abstractions with sub-policy capabilities is particularly original, as is the use of contrastive meta-learning to disentangle task-invariant and task-specific policy components. The incorporation of LLM-guided refinement for neuro-symbolic plan repair is also innovative. While individual components like meta-learning and symbolic planning have been explored in the literature (as evidenced by the cited works like NeSyC and Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer), their integration in this specific manner, especially with the bi-level optimization approach, represents a significant advancement. The proposal could have scored higher if it had more explicitly differentiated its approach from existing neuro-symbolic frameworks like those mentioned in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations in both symbolic planning and reinforcement learning. The methodology is well-structured and follows a logical progression from framework development to empirical evaluation. The algorithmic steps are grounded in existing techniques like PDDL for symbolic planning and meta-reinforcement learning for neural sub-policies. The evaluation metrics are appropriate for assessing the framework's performance. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) the mathematical formulation of the bi-level optimization problem is not provided, which is crucial for understanding how symbolic abstractions will be aligned with sub-policy capabilities; (2) the contrastive meta-learning approach is described conceptually but lacks formal definition; and (3) the proposal does not thoroughly address potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, such as how the framework would handle situations where the symbolic planner generates plans that cannot be executed by the neural sub-policies."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially achievable research agenda. The individual components (symbolic planning, meta-learning, etc.) have been demonstrated in prior work, suggesting their feasibility. The use of existing benchmarks like ProcTHOR for evaluation is practical. However, several aspects raise concerns about feasibility: (1) the bi-level optimization for aligning symbolic abstractions with neural capabilities is computationally intensive and may not scale well to complex domains; (2) meta-learning across diverse environments requires substantial computational resources and data; (3) the integration of LLM-guided refinement adds another layer of complexity that may be difficult to implement effectively; (4) the proposal does not provide a clear timeline or resource allocation plan, making it difficult to assess whether the research can be completed within a reasonable timeframe; and (5) the formal verification component, while mentioned, is not detailed enough to determine its implementability. These challenges collectively suggest that while the research direction is promising, full implementation may face significant practical hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: bridging the gap between data-driven RL and symbolic planning to enable cross-domain generalization in sequential decision-making. This has significant implications for advancing deployable AI systems, particularly in robotics and autonomous vehicles where adaptability to new environments is crucial. The unification of planning and RL communities represents an important step toward more integrated approaches in AI research. The potential for improved sample efficiency and zero-shot generalization would be a substantial contribution to the field. The integration of formal verification methods also enhances the practical applicability of the framework in safety-critical domains. The proposal aligns well with the workshop's focus on generalization in planning and could influence future research directions in neuro-symbolic AI. However, the significance would be even higher if the proposal had more explicitly quantified the expected improvements over existing methods or provided preliminary results suggesting the magnitude of potential impact."
