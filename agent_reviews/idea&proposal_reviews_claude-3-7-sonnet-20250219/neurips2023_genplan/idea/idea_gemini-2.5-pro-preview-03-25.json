    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key topics mentioned in the workshop, including neuro-symbolic approaches for generalization in sequential decision-making, meta-learning for generalizable policies, hierarchical policies, and few-shot learning for SDM. The proposal specifically bridges the gap between symbolic planning (for generalizability) and reinforcement learning (for adaptive control), which is a central theme of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some of the formal aspects mentioned in the task description, such as formal formulations of generalized SDM problems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented clearly and concisely. The motivation establishes the problem context well, and the main idea articulates a specific approach using meta-reinforcement learning conditioned on symbolic subgoal representations. The hierarchical structure with high-level symbolic planning and low-level policy execution is well-defined. However, some implementation details remain ambiguous, such as how exactly the symbolic representations will be integrated with the meta-learning framework, what specific meta-RL algorithm would be used, and how the symbolic planner would be constructed or learned. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. The integration of meta-reinforcement learning with symbolic subgoal representations for few-shot generalization is an innovative approach. While hierarchical reinforcement learning, symbolic planning, and meta-learning are established areas individually, their specific combination for few-shot generalization of symbolic subgoals appears to be relatively unexplored. However, the approach builds significantly on existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or frameworks, which limits its novelty score. Similar neuro-symbolic approaches and hierarchical meta-learning methods have been explored in related contexts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Meta-reinforcement learning is notoriously sample-inefficient and can be unstable during training. Integrating symbolic representations with neural networks requires careful design of the interface between these different paradigms. The proposal would need to address how to handle the potentially large symbolic state space, how to design appropriate reward functions for subgoals, and how to ensure the high-level planner generates achievable subgoals. These challenges are significant but not insurmountable given recent advances in meta-RL and neuro-symbolic methods. The research would likely require substantial computational resources and expertise in both symbolic AI and deep RL."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: combining the generalizability of symbolic methods with the adaptability of deep learning for sequential decision-making. If successful, it could significantly advance the field by enabling more sample-efficient transfer learning and few-shot adaptation to new tasks. The approach could be particularly impactful for robotics and other real-world applications where data efficiency and generalization are crucial. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's direct relevance to bridging the gap between deep RL and symbolic planning communities, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals. However, the impact might be somewhat limited by the complexity of implementation and potential scalability issues in more complex domains."
