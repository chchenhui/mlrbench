    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on generalization in planning and sequential decision making. It directly addresses multiple key topics mentioned in the task description, including neuro-symbolic approaches, few-shot learning, meta-learning for generalizable policies, and learning generalized heuristics. The proposal combines deep reinforcement learning with symbolic planning to tackle the core challenges of sample efficiency, generalization, and transfer in SDM that are explicitly highlighted in the workshop description. The only minor reason it's not a perfect 10 is that it could have more explicitly addressed how it connects to some of the other listed topics like program synthesis or robot planning problems."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, approach, and expected outcomes. The core concept of using a meta-learned GNN to predict abstract subgoals or heuristic cost estimates is understandable. However, there are some ambiguities that prevent a higher score. For instance, the exact mechanism of how the symbolic graph encoding works is not fully explained, nor is the precise interaction between the GNN's outputs and the symbolic planner. The proposal would benefit from more specific details about the implementation of MAML in this context and how the symbolic planner 'refines' the GNN's suggestions into actions. These details would make the methodology more reproducible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong originality by combining several cutting-edge approaches in a novel way. The integration of meta-learning (MAML), graph neural networks, and symbolic planning for few-shot generalization in SDM represents a fresh synthesis not commonly seen in the literature. The approach of using a neural network to predict heuristics or subgoals for a symbolic planner is innovative. However, each individual component (GNNs, MAML, symbolic planning) is well-established, and similar neuro-symbolic approaches have been explored, though perhaps not with this specific combination and application to few-shot generalization in SDM. The novelty lies more in the integration and application rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing technologies and methods. GNNs, MAML, and symbolic planners are all established techniques with available implementations. The domains mentioned (block stacking, maze navigation) are standard benchmarks with existing environments. However, there are implementation challenges that prevent a higher score. Meta-learning across diverse SDM tasks can be computationally expensive and technically challenging. The symbolic encoding of tasks into graphs requires careful design to capture relevant information. Additionally, the integration between the neural and symbolic components might face interface issues, particularly in determining how the GNN's outputs are effectively utilized by the symbolic planner. These challenges are surmountable but would require significant engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: enabling agents to generalize from limited experience in sequential decision making. If successful, the approach could significantly advance the field by reducing sample complexity while maintaining strong generalization capabilities - addressing two major limitations of current methods. The neuro-symbolic integration proposed could bridge an important gap between data-driven and analytical methods, potentially influencing future research directions. The impact would be particularly notable in domains requiring both sample efficiency and transfer learning. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on standard benchmark domains rather than more complex real-world applications, and it's unclear how the approach would scale to problems with very large state spaces or partial observability."
