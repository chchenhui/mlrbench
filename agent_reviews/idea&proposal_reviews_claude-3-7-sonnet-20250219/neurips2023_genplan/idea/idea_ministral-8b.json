        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses meta-learning for sequential decision-making, which is explicitly mentioned as one of the workshop topics ('Meta-learning for generalizable policies'). The proposal focuses on generalization and transfer in SDM, sample efficiency, and adaptability to new tasks - all central themes of the workshop. It bridges the gap between reinforcement learning and planning approaches, which is a key focus of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it could have more explicitly addressed some specific topics like hierarchical policies or neuro-symbolic approaches, though these could be incorporated into the framework."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the motivation, main idea, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-step approach (meta-training, meta-testing, and task-specific fine-tuning) provides a concrete structure for the research. The goals and expected outcomes are well-defined. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific architecture of the meta-learner, the exact mechanisms for transferring knowledge between tasks, and more concrete examples of the types of SDM tasks that would be included in the training set. These details would make the proposal even more precise and actionable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows good novelty in its specific application to sequential decision-making problems. While meta-learning itself is not new, and has been applied to reinforcement learning before, the focus on developing a comprehensive framework specifically for generalized SDM with emphasis on long-horizon planning represents a valuable contribution. The integration of meta-learning principles with SDM challenges is innovative. However, the core techniques mentioned (meta-training, meta-testing, fine-tuning) are established approaches in meta-learning. The proposal would be more novel if it included specific innovations in the meta-learning algorithms themselves or novel architectural components designed specifically for SDM problems."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology and methods. Meta-learning frameworks exist and have been applied to various domains, and the extension to SDM is reasonable. The three-step methodology provides a clear path for implementation. However, there are significant challenges that may arise: (1) creating a diverse yet representative set of SDM tasks for meta-training, (2) ensuring the meta-learner can effectively capture generalizable patterns across different SDM domains, and (3) addressing the computational complexity of meta-learning over sequential decision processes. These challenges are substantial but not insurmountable, making the proposal feasible but requiring careful design and implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in AI: enabling systems to generalize and transfer knowledge across sequential decision-making tasks. If successful, it could significantly advance sample efficiency in reinforcement learning and planning, which is a major bottleneck in current approaches. The potential applications span numerous domains where SDM is crucial, including robotics, autonomous systems, logistics, and resource allocation. The work bridges reinforcement learning and planning communities, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals. The significance is high because it tackles fundamental limitations in current AI systems' ability to generalize from limited examples - a capability that humans possess but AI systems struggle with."
