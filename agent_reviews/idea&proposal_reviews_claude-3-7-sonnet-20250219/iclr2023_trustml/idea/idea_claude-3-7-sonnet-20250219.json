    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, addressing both statistical limitations (limited high-quality labeled data) and trustworthiness concerns (privacy) in ML systems. The proposed Privacy-Preserving Active Learning (PPAL) framework directly tackles the intersection of data scarcity and privacy requirements mentioned in the task. The idea focuses on healthcare, finance, and social services, which are explicitly mentioned as sensitive domains in the task description. However, it doesn't explicitly address some other trustworthiness aspects mentioned in the task such as fairness, robustness, or explainability, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear motivation and main concept. The PPAL framework is described with its core components: balancing informativeness and privacy risk, using an uncertainty-guided privacy mechanism, and implementing a modified acquisition function. However, some technical details remain ambiguous. For instance, the exact mechanism of the 'uncertainty-guided privacy mechanism' and how the 'privacy budget allocation strategy' works in practice are not fully elaborated. The proposal would benefit from more specific details about the implementation approach and evaluation metrics to make it completely clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by combining active learning with privacy-preserving techniques in a way that hasn't been extensively explored. The dynamic balancing of informativeness and privacy risk during query selection appears to be an innovative approach. The uncertainty-guided privacy mechanism that applies varying levels of privacy protection based on sample sensitivity is particularly novel. While both active learning and differential privacy exist separately, their integration with adaptive privacy budgeting based on information content represents a fresh perspective that addresses a gap in current research. The approach isn't completely revolutionary, but it offers a meaningful new direction in the intersection of these two important areas."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. While both active learning and differential privacy are established techniques with existing implementations, combining them effectively presents several technical hurdles. The proposed adaptive privacy budget allocation based on sample informativeness would require careful theoretical development to ensure privacy guarantees are maintained. Empirical validation would need to demonstrate that the privacy-utility tradeoff is actually improved compared to baseline approaches. The implementation would likely require significant expertise in both active learning and privacy-preserving techniques. Additionally, evaluating the approach in real healthcare or financial settings would involve navigating complex regulatory and data access issues. These challenges are surmountable but substantial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical intersection of problems in trustworthy ML: data scarcity and privacy preservation. Its significance is high because it targets domains where both issues are paramount (healthcare, finance, social services). If successful, the approach could enable more effective ML deployment in sensitive, high-stakes applications where data collection is difficult and privacy concerns are significant. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications that could benefit vulnerable populations. The work could establish a new paradigm for developing ML systems under dual constraints of limited data and privacy requirements. However, the impact might be somewhat limited by the technical complexity of implementation and potential difficulties in adoption by practitioners without ML expertise."
