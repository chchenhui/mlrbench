    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the three key challenges identified in the workshop description: data scarcity, privacy, and bias/fairness in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and education. The methodology incorporates differential privacy (DP-SGD) and fairness constraints into LLM-based tabular data generation, which perfectly matches the research idea. The proposal cites and builds upon relevant literature, specifically referencing DP-TBART, DP-LLMTGen, and TableDiffusion from the literature review. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that comprehensively assess utility, privacy, and fairness aspects."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology section provides detailed technical explanations of both the differential privacy mechanism and fairness-aware training approach, including mathematical formulations. The experimental design outlines specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact architecture of the LLM adaptation for tabular data could be more precisely defined, (2) the fairness regularizer could be expanded to cover multiple sensitive attributes and fairness metrics beyond demographic parity, and (3) the decoding with constraints section is somewhat brief compared to the training section and could benefit from more detailed explanation of the implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating differential privacy and fairness constraints into a unified LLM-based framework for tabular data generation. While individual components (DP-SGD, fairness regularization) have been explored separately in the literature, their combination within an LLM architecture specifically for tabular data represents a fresh approach. The fairness-aware masking strategy during decoding is particularly innovative. However, the approach builds significantly on existing methods like DP-TBART and DP-LLMTGen rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The proposal extends and combines existing approaches in a thoughtful way rather than presenting a completely novel paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The differential privacy mechanism is well-defined with proper mathematical formulations of gradient clipping and noise addition. The fairness regularizer using KL divergence is theoretically sound for enforcing demographic parity. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and appropriate for measuring utility (Fréchet Distance, downstream ML performance), privacy (ε-budget, membership inference attack success), and fairness (demographic parity difference, equalized odds difference). The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and ablation studies to isolate effects of different components. One minor limitation is that the proposal doesn't fully address potential theoretical tensions between DP and fairness objectives, which might require more rigorous analysis of their interaction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Fine-tuning LLMs with DP-SGD has been demonstrated in prior work, and the fairness regularization approach is implementable. The datasets mentioned (MIMIC-IV, Adult Income Census, Student Performance) are accessible and appropriate for the task. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) balancing the competing objectives of privacy, fairness, and utility might require extensive hyperparameter tuning, (2) achieving the targeted privacy budget of ε ≤ 2 while maintaining utility is ambitious and may require significant optimization, (3) the computational resources needed for fine-tuning LLMs with DP-SGD could be substantial, and (4) the fairness-aware masking strategy during decoding needs further elaboration to assess its practical implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem at the intersection of privacy, fairness, and synthetic data generation that has substantial real-world impact. Success would enable organizations in healthcare, finance, and education to share synthetic datasets without compromising individual privacy while simultaneously mitigating biases. This directly supports trustworthy ML deployment in high-stakes domains where ethical and legal constraints are paramount. The expected outcomes include quantifiable improvements in both privacy guarantees and fairness metrics compared to existing methods. The open-source implementation and benchmark datasets would further amplify the impact by enabling reproducibility and adoption by the broader research community. The work could establish a new standard for trustworthy synthetic data generation with clear pathways to practical applications."
