    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the three key challenges identified in the workshop description: data scarcity, privacy, and bias/fairness in tabular data. The methodology incorporates differential privacy mechanisms (DP-SGD, noise injection) and fairness constraints (demographic parity, equalized odds) as outlined in the research idea. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by extending work on differentially private tabular data synthesis using LLMs, addressing the gap identified in balancing utility, privacy, and fairness simultaneously. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and cover all aspects mentioned in both the task description and literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The algorithmic steps are detailed and provide a clear roadmap for implementation. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and cover the key aspects of data utility, privacy, and fairness. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the specific LLM architecture to be used is not definitively selected, (2) the exact mathematical formulation of how fairness constraints will be incorporated into the training objective could be more detailed, and (3) the trade-off management between competing objectives (utility, privacy, fairness) could be more explicitly addressed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining differential privacy and fairness constraints in LLM-based tabular data synthesis. While individual components (DP-LLMs for tabular data, fairness-aware generation) exist in the literature, the comprehensive integration of both privacy and fairness constraints into LLM fine-tuning represents a fresh approach. The proposal extends beyond existing work by explicitly addressing the trade-offs between utility, privacy, and fairness in a unified framework. However, it builds significantly on existing methods mentioned in the literature review (such as DP-TBART, DP-LLMTGen, and DP-2Stage) rather than introducing entirely new techniques, which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on well-established theoretical foundations. The differential privacy mechanisms (DP-SGD, noise injection) are well-justified and have strong theoretical backing. The fairness constraints (demographic parity, equalized odds) are appropriate for addressing bias in synthetic data. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and aligned with standard practices in the field. The research design follows a logical progression from data collection to model fine-tuning to data generation and evaluation. However, there are some areas that could benefit from more rigorous treatment: (1) the exact privacy guarantees and their mathematical formulation could be more detailed, (2) the potential trade-offs between competing objectives could be analyzed more thoroughly, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential failure modes and mitigation strategies."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The use of pre-trained LLMs as a foundation is practical, and the differential privacy mechanisms (DP-SGD) have established implementations. The evaluation metrics are measurable and can be computed with existing tools. However, there are several implementation challenges: (1) fine-tuning LLMs with DP-SGD can be computationally expensive and may require significant resources, (2) balancing multiple competing objectives (utility, privacy, fairness) simultaneously is complex and may require careful hyperparameter tuning, (3) the proposal doesn't fully address the potential computational challenges of enforcing fairness constraints during generation, and (4) the effectiveness of the approach may vary significantly across different datasets and domains, requiring extensive experimentation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning: generating high-quality synthetic data that maintains utility while ensuring privacy and fairness. This is particularly important for sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, where data scarcity, privacy concerns, and bias are significant barriers to ML adoption. The potential impact is substantial: (1) enabling more trustworthy ML model development in high-stakes domains, (2) providing a framework for balancing competing ethical considerations in synthetic data generation, (3) advancing the state-of-the-art in privacy-preserving and fair ML, and (4) potentially influencing policy and practice around synthetic data use. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's goal of using synthetic data to empower trustworthy ML training, making it highly significant to the field."
