        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for trustworthy and reliable large-scale ML models by focusing on machine unlearning to mitigate privacy, toxicity, and bias issues in LLMs - explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest in the task description. The proposal faithfully expands on the research idea, developing a framework that integrates PEFT techniques with gradient-based influence estimation for scalable unlearning. It incorporates all key elements from the idea, including the identification of parameters affected by target data, isolation of influences into PEFT components, and lightweight fine-tuning to preserve knowledge. The proposal also builds upon the literature review effectively, citing relevant works like SalUn for gradient tracing and comparing against baselines like LMEraser, S3T, and Fast-NTK. The computational efficiency target (<5% overhead compared to retraining) aligns with the challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from background to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and numbered for easy reference. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations and pseudocode to illustrate the unlearning algorithm. The experimental design section clearly outlines datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the gradient-based influence estimation and the PEFT modules could be more explicitly defined; (2) The threshold determination for influence scores is mentioned but not fully specified; and (3) Some technical terms (e.g., 'machine unbilling' in future directions) are introduced without explanation. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining two existing approaches (PEFT and gradient-based influence estimation) in a novel way specifically for LLM unlearning. While both PEFT techniques and gradient-based influence methods have been explored separately in the literature, their integration for machine unlearning in LLMs represents a fresh perspective. The proposal distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on modular parameterization to isolate data-specific influences, which enables more targeted unlearning. However, the core techniques (LoRA, gradient tracing) are established methods, and the novelty lies primarily in their combination and application to the unlearning problem rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal acknowledges its relationship to existing methods like SalUn, Fast-NTK, and S3T, while highlighting its unique contributions in scalability and formal guarantees."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established techniques from machine learning, with clear mathematical formulations for gradient-based influence estimation and differential unlearning guarantees. The integration of PEFT with gradient tracing is theoretically justified, and the approach to isolating data-specific influences in low-rank modules is sound. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The proposal also acknowledges theoretical aspects by discussing formal differential unlearning bounds and how they scale with the rank of LoRA modules. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) The approximation of influence using k-NN in gradient space could benefit from more theoretical justification; (2) The claim that ε-bounds scale linearly with rank r would be stronger with a sketch of the proof; and (3) The threshold for influence scores is presented without clear justification for the 'top 10%' choice."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods. The use of established PEFT techniques like LoRA and gradient-based influence estimation makes implementation practical. The computational requirements (8×A100 GPUs for 12 hours) are reasonable for research institutions and industry labs. The experimental design with specific models (LLaMA-7B, OPT-13B) and datasets is realistic and well-defined. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional resources or refinement: (1) Scaling gradient tracing to billion-parameter models may be more computationally intensive than estimated; (2) Achieving the target of <5% computational overhead compared to full retraining is ambitious and may require significant optimization; (3) The formal differential unlearning guarantees for non-convex models like LLMs are challenging to establish rigorously; and (4) The expected toxicity reduction of 92% may be optimistic given the complexity of the problem. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is feasible with current technology and reasonable resources."

Machine unlearning for LLMs directly tackles privacy, bias, and toxicity concerns that are central to ethical AI deployment. The significance is high across multiple dimensions: (1) Practical utility: Enabling organizations to comply with data deletion regulations like GDPR without prohibitive computational costs; (2) Ethical implications: Providing mechanisms to reduce harmful biases and toxic content in deployed models; (3) Technical advancement: Bridging the gap between theoretical unlearning guarantees and practical implementations for large-scale models; (4) Resource efficiency: Potentially reducing the environmental and economic costs of model refinement by avoiding full retraining; and (5) Accessibility: Making LLM refinement accessible to organizations with limited computational resources. The expected outcomes, including a benchmark dataset and open-source toolkit, would provide valuable resources to the research community and industry practitioners.
