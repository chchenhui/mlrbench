    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for trustworthy and reliable large-scale ML models by focusing on machine unlearning to mitigate privacy, toxicity, and bias issues in LLMs - explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest in the task description. The proposal follows the research idea closely, implementing parameter-efficient fine-tuning with gradient-based influence estimation for scalable unlearning. It builds upon the literature review by addressing limitations in existing approaches (Fast-NTK, S3T, LMEraser, SalUn) while incorporating their strengths. The formal privacy guarantees (differential unlearning) and computational efficiency targets (<5% overhead) are consistent with both the idea and literature challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The four-stage unlearning pipeline (PEFT Decomposition, Influence Estimation, Targeted Module Unlearning, Post-Deletion Fine-Tuning) is logically organized and thoroughly explained. Technical formulations are precise, with mathematical notation properly defined. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear metrics and baselines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for privacy accounting could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the influence score and differential unlearning guarantees could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some implementation details regarding the vectorized gradient hooks could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing techniques in a novel way. The integration of PEFT with gradient-based influence estimation for targeted unlearning is innovative, as is the approach to isolate data-specific influences into modular components. The two-pronged unlearning strategy (zeroing vs. gradient subtraction) offers a fresh perspective. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing work: PEFT/LoRA techniques are established, gradient-based influence estimation has been explored in papers like SalUn, and differential privacy mechanisms are well-known. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches, making it an innovative combination rather than a groundbreaking new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theory. The mathematical formulations for influence estimation and gradient subtraction are correct and clearly presented. The differential unlearning guarantee is based on solid theoretical foundations in Rényi-DP. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics that cover utility, unlearning efficacy, efficiency, and privacy guarantees. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the effects of different components. The only minor concerns are: (1) the assumption that memorized content will concentrate in the PEFT modules could benefit from more theoretical justification, and (2) the privacy accounting mechanism could be more rigorously defined to ensure the claimed (ε,δ)-unlearning guarantees will hold under all conditions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The use of established frameworks (PyTorch, HuggingFace, Opacus) and well-understood techniques (LoRA, gradient clipping) increases practicality. The computational overhead target of <5% compared to full retraining is ambitious but potentially achievable given the parameter-efficient approach. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) computing per-example gradients for large models is memory-intensive, though the proposal addresses this with minibatch sampling; (2) the influence estimation may be noisy for very large datasets; (3) balancing the privacy-utility tradeoff with the proposed noise injection might require extensive hyperparameter tuning; and (4) achieving the targeted 20× speedup while maintaining <2% utility loss is optimistic and may require refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in trustworthy AI with substantial potential impact. Machine unlearning for LLMs has direct applications for regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA), ethical AI deployment, and mitigating privacy risks. The expected outcomes would significantly advance the field by: (1) providing a practical toolkit for industry adoption, (2) establishing formal guarantees for unlearning, (3) creating standardized benchmarks for future research, and (4) demonstrating scalable unlearning for models of practical size. The broader impact section convincingly articulates how this work could influence privacy compliance, ethical AI development, and future research directions. The significance is particularly high given the increasing deployment of LLMs in sensitive applications and growing regulatory pressure for data deletion capabilities."
