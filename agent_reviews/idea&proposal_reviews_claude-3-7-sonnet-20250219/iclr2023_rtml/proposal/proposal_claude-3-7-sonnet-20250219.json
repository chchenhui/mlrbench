        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for trustworthy and reliable large-scale ML models by focusing on machine unlearning for LLMs, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as a topic of interest. The proposal follows the core idea of using parameter-efficient fine-tuning for scalable machine unlearning, incorporating gradient-based influence estimation to identify parameters affected by target data. The methodology thoroughly builds upon the literature review, citing relevant approaches like Fast-NTK, S3T, and gradient-based methods from SalUn. The proposal also addresses all key challenges identified in the literature review: computational efficiency (through PEFT), preserving model utility (via knowledge preservation fine-tuning), addressing catastrophic forgetting (through the two-stage approach), formal privacy guarantees (with differential unlearning framework), and generalization (by testing across multiple scenarios and model architectures)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering multiple dimensions of evaluation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact procedure for creating the 'retain set' and ensuring it doesn't contain information similar to the forget set could be more precisely defined; (2) The relationship between the influence estimation and the LoRA-U approach could be more explicitly connected; and (3) Some technical details about the implementation of differential unlearning guarantees could be further elaborated. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is clear enough for readers to understand the approach and its potential impact."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing techniques into a novel framework specifically designed for LLM unlearning. The Low-Rank Adaptation for Unlearning (LoRA-U) approach extends existing PEFT methods in a novel way for the unlearning task. The combination of gradient-based influence estimation with parameter-efficient fine-tuning represents a fresh perspective on machine unlearning. The two-stage approach involving both unlearning and knowledge preservation is also innovative. However, many of the individual components build directly on existing methods (LoRA, influence functions, gradient ascent for unlearning) rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The proposal acknowledges its relationship to prior work like Fast-NTK, S3T, and SalUn, while extending these approaches to the specific context of LLMs. While not groundbreaking in terms of theoretical foundations, the proposal offers a novel integration of existing methods to address an important problem in a more efficient way."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The gradient-based influence estimation builds on established theoretical foundations from influence functions literature. The mathematical formulations for LoRA-U and the unlearning objectives are technically sound and properly presented. The approach to formal guarantees through differential unlearning is theoretically well-grounded. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering multiple dimensions of evaluation with appropriate metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and challenges, showing awareness of technical constraints. However, there are some areas that could benefit from deeper theoretical analysis: (1) The theoretical connection between the influence estimation and the actual forgetting efficacy could be more rigorously established; (2) The formal guarantees section could provide more detailed mathematical derivations of the privacy bounds; and (3) The potential interactions between the unlearning adaptors and the knowledge preservation fine-tuning could be analyzed more thoroughly for potential conflicts. Despite these minor limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with realistic implementation plans. The use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques significantly reduces computational requirements compared to full retraining, making the approach practical for real-world deployment. The targeting of widely used open-source LLMs like Llama-2 and Mistral is appropriate and realistic. The implementation leverages existing libraries like PEFT, which increases feasibility. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional resources or refinement: (1) The gradient-based influence estimation may still be computationally intensive for very large models, even with the proposed optimizations; (2) Creating appropriate forget sets and retain sets for evaluation requires careful curation; (3) Establishing formal differential unlearning guarantees for complex non-convex models like LLMs is challenging and may require theoretical approximations; and (4) The two-stage approach with both unlearning and knowledge preservation may require careful hyperparameter tuning to balance competing objectives. While these challenges are significant, they don't fundamentally undermine the feasibility of the approach, especially given the clear implementation plan and the use of established components."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the deployment of large language models with significant real-world implications. The ability to efficiently and effectively remove unwanted information from LLMs has direct applications for privacy compliance (GDPR), ethical AI development, and reducing environmental impact of AI systems. The expected outcomes include both theoretical contributions (formal guarantees for parameter-efficient unlearning) and practical tools (open-source implementation and benchmarks) that would benefit both researchers and practitioners. The proposal explicitly connects to multiple dimensions of trustworthy AI mentioned in the task description, including privacy, fairness, ethics, and robustness. The potential impact extends beyond the specific unlearning task to broader questions of parameter-efficient model modification, with applications in model updating and adaptation. The significance is further enhanced by the growing regulatory pressure around AI systems and the increasing deployment of LLMs in sensitive domains. The proposal's focus on making unlearning accessible to organizations with limited resources also contributes to democratizing access to trustworthy AI technology."
