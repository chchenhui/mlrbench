    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The 'Causal Insight' proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description of developing trustworthy and reliable large-scale ML models. It directly addresses the 'black box' nature of large models mentioned in the task, and focuses on interpretability, robustness, and fairness - all key topics listed. The proposal specifically targets applications in healthcare and law, which are highlighted as mission-critical domains in the task description. The modular architecture with causal reasoning addresses the need for explainable AI methods for large-scale models, and the multi-objective loss incorporating robustness to distributional shifts aligns with the task's focus on reliability under domain shifts. The only minor gap is that while privacy is mentioned as a benefit, the proposal doesn't detail specific privacy-preserving mechanisms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured logically. The motivation clearly establishes the problem of black-box models and the limitations of post-hoc interpretability. The main idea presents a coherent approach using modular architecture with disentangled causal reasoning, multi-objective loss functions, and lightweight causal graphs. The expected impact section effectively connects back to the motivation. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration - for instance, how exactly the causal graphs will be constructed and maintained at scale, how the feature groups will be determined, and what specific metrics will quantify 'explanation fidelity.' While the overall approach is clear, these implementation details would strengthen the clarity of the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a fresh perspective by embedding interpretability directly into model design through modular, causal reasoning rather than applying post-hoc explanations. This 'explain as they infer' approach represents a significant departure from conventional interpretability methods. The combination of modular architecture with causal reasoning and multi-objective optimization for balancing performance, interpretability, and robustness is innovative. The idea of using lightweight causal graphs to identify key decision drivers and prune non-essential components also adds novelty. While individual components (modularity, causal reasoning, multi-objective optimization) exist in the literature, their integration into a comprehensive framework specifically designed for large-scale models represents a novel contribution. The proposal isn't entirely unprecedented, as causal interpretability has been explored before, but the specific implementation and scale proposed here appear to be original."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal faces several implementation challenges that affect its feasibility. First, learning accurate causal relationships in high-dimensional spaces typical of large-scale models is notoriously difficult and computationally expensive. Second, maintaining model performance while enforcing interpretability constraints often involves trade-offs that the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address. Third, the modular architecture may introduce computational overhead that could limit scalability. The proposal mentions benchmarking against vision and language tasks, but doesn't specify how the approach would scale to the billions of parameters in modern foundation models. The lightweight causal graphs could help with efficiency, but their effectiveness at scale remains uncertain. While the core ideas are implementable with current technology, significant research and engineering efforts would be required to make them work effectively for truly large-scale models, making this a moderately feasible proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is substantial. Interpretability and robustness are critical challenges for deploying large-scale AI in high-stakes domains, and this proposal directly addresses these issues. If successful, the approach could transform how we build trustworthy AI systems by embedding interpretability from the ground up rather than as an afterthought. The modular nature of the proposed architecture would enable fine-grained diagnosis of model decisions, which is particularly valuable for identifying and mitigating biases or failure modes. Applications in healthcare and legal analytics could benefit tremendously from verifiable explanations that remain faithful under domain shifts. The proposal also aligns with growing regulatory requirements for explainable AI in critical applications. The potential impact extends beyond the specific implementation to providing a blueprint for future trustworthy AI design, making this a highly significant contribution to the field."
