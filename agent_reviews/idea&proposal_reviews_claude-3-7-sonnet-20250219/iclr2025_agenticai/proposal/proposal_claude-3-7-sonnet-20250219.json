    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The DecompAI proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on agentic AI for scientific discovery, particularly Thrust 1 (design of agentic AI systems) and Thrust 2 (theoretical foundations). The proposal incorporates the multi-agent decomposition framework outlined in the research idea, with specialized agents handling different aspects of hypothesis generation. It builds upon the literature review by acknowledging systems like AstroAgents, VirSci, and SciAgents while addressing their limitations. The game-theoretic coordination mechanism draws from the Wen et al. paper mentioned in the literature review. The proposal also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, including agent coordination, domain-specific fine-tuning, balancing cooperation and divergence, evaluation metrics, and human-AI collaboration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and research objectives. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the system architecture, agent specialization, dynamic knowledge graph, game-theoretic coordination, and evaluation approach. The mathematical formulations for the loss function, knowledge graph representation, and utility functions enhance precision. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanisms for resolving conflicts between agents could be more explicitly defined, (2) the relationship between the DKG and the game-theoretic coordination could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the trust region optimization are somewhat abstract. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The decomposition of the scientific discovery process into specialized agent roles (Explorer, Knowledge, Reasoning, Experiment, and Critic) represents a fresh approach compared to existing systems. The integration of a dynamic knowledge graph with game-theoretic coordination mechanisms is innovative, particularly the formulation of utility functions that balance individual, collective, and divergence objectives. The domain-specific fine-tuning approach with role-specific loss functions is also novel. However, the core multi-agent concept builds upon existing work like AstroAgents, VirSci, and SciAgents mentioned in the literature review. While DecompAI extends and refines these approaches with more sophisticated coordination mechanisms and specialized agents, it represents an evolutionary rather than revolutionary advancement. The proposal could have pushed boundaries further by exploring more radical agent architectures or coordination mechanisms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for the loss function, knowledge graph representation, and game-theoretic coordination are well-defined and theoretically sound. The approach to agent specialization through domain-specific fine-tuning is well-justified, with clear training objectives for each agent type. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including hypothesis quality metrics, system performance metrics, and comparative evaluation against baselines. The ablation studies are well-designed to assess the contribution of each system component. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) more detailed explanation of how the trust region constraints are enforced during optimization, (2) clearer specification of how uncertainty is quantified and propagated through the system, and (3) more rigorous statistical analysis methods for the evaluation process. Overall, the proposal is technically sound with only minor gaps in methodological detail."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation paths. The modular architecture allows for incremental development and testing of individual components. The use of existing foundation models as starting points for agent specialization is practical. The evaluation methodology leverages established benchmarks in chemical synthesis and genetic pathway discovery. The human-AI collaboration interface provides a practical mechanism for expert oversight. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) the computational resources required for fine-tuning multiple specialized agents could be substantial, (2) creating comprehensive domain-specific corpora for training might be time-consuming, (3) implementing the dynamic knowledge graph with effective versioning and querying capabilities presents technical challenges, and (4) the game-theoretic coordination mechanism may require significant tuning to achieve the right balance between cooperation and divergence. While these challenges are manageable, they do increase the implementation complexity and resource requirements, making the proposal moderately rather than highly feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The DecompAI proposal addresses a critical challenge in scientific discovery: leveraging AI to generate high-quality, testable hypotheses across domains. If successful, the impact could be substantial across multiple scientific fields. The expected outcomes include significant improvements in hypothesis quality (30% increase in expert-rated quality, 40% increase in testability), enhanced transparency through decomposed architecture, efficient multi-domain adaptation, validated experimental designs, and open-source resources. The broader impacts include accelerated scientific progress, democratization of scientific innovation, cross-domain knowledge transfer, resource optimization, and new models for human-AI collaboration. These outcomes align perfectly with the workshop's focus on advancing agentic AI for science. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the proposal focuses primarily on hypothesis generation rather than addressing the full scientific discovery lifecycle, and the initial implementation is limited to two domains (chemistry and genetics). Nevertheless, the potential for transformative impact on scientific discovery processes makes this a highly significant proposal."
