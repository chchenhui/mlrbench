    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses Thrust 1 of the workshop by developing a multi-agent decomposition framework for scientific hypothesis generation. The proposal incorporates game-theoretic coordination (referencing Wen et al., 2021 from the literature review) and builds upon multi-agent systems like AstroAgents, VirSci, and SciAgents mentioned in the literature review. The proposal also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, including agent coordination, domain-specific fine-tuning, balancing cooperation and divergence, evaluation metrics, and human-AI collaboration. The methodology section thoroughly explains how these challenges will be tackled. The only minor inconsistency is that some references in the proposal (e.g., Saeedi et al., 2025) have future dates, which appears to be an oversight."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, conceptual framework, agent design, knowledge representation, coordination mechanism, and evaluation methods are all thoroughly explained. The workflow of the DecompAI system is presented in a logical sequence, making it easy to understand how the different components interact. The mathematical formulation of the utility function for game-theoretic coordination is particularly well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of how agents will be fine-tuned could be more specific, (2) the proposal could more clearly distinguish how its approach differs from existing systems like AstroAgents and SciAgents, and (3) some technical details about the knowledge graph implementation and querying could be elaborated further."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of several existing concepts rather than a fundamentally new approach. Its originality lies in the specific combination of: (1) specialized agent roles for different aspects of hypothesis generation, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph as a central hub for information exchange, (3) game-theoretic coordination to balance cooperation and divergence, and (4) domain specialization through fine-tuning. While multi-agent systems for scientific discovery exist in the literature (AstroAgents, VirSci, SciAgents), DecompAI's focus on decomposing the hypothesis generation process into distinct functional roles and the explicit game-theoretic formulation for agent coordination provides a fresh perspective. The utility function design that balances cooperation, divergence, and task completion is particularly innovative. However, many of the individual components build directly on existing work, limiting the overall novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established techniques from multi-agent systems, knowledge representation, game theory, and language model fine-tuning. The game-theoretic coordination mechanism is mathematically formalized with a clear utility function. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including both computational metrics and human expert assessment. The knowledge graph design for representing scientific entities, relationships, and hypothesis components is well-conceived. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, such as the need for domain expertise and the risk of hallucinations. However, there are some areas where additional technical details would strengthen the soundness: (1) more specific details on how the fine-tuning datasets will be constructed and validated, (2) clearer explanation of how the weights in the utility function will be determined or learned, and (3) more rigorous discussion of how the system will handle conflicting information or uncertainty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach using existing technologies and methods. The implementation relies on established foundation models (GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3), well-known frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI), and standard graph databases (Neo4j, ArangoDB). The domain-specific datasets for fine-tuning (chemical literature, genetic pathway databases) are accessible. The evaluation methodology is practical, combining computational metrics with human expert assessment. However, several implementation challenges may affect feasibility: (1) fine-tuning specialized agents for deep domain expertise requires significant computational resources and expertise, (2) implementing and optimizing the game-theoretic coordination mechanism may be complex, (3) ensuring effective knowledge sharing through the graph database requires careful design, and (4) the human evaluation protocol requires recruiting domain experts, which can be time-consuming and expensive. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the proposal impractical, but they do suggest that full implementation may require substantial resources and time."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in scientific discovery - the need for more effective AI-driven hypothesis generation. If successful, DecompAI could significantly impact how researchers explore complex scientific domains, potentially accelerating discoveries in chemistry and genetics. The framework directly addresses multiple thrusts from the workshop description, particularly Thrust 1 (multi-agent decomposition design) and Thrust 2 (theoretical foundations like game theory). The modular design allows for adaptation to other scientific domains beyond the initial test cases. The focus on transparency and reduced hallucination addresses a critical need in scientific AI applications. The human-in-the-loop integration promotes effective collaboration between AI and domain experts. The potential contributions to standardized benchmarking for AI-driven hypothesis generation are also valuable. While the immediate impact may be limited to specific scientific domains (chemistry and genetics), the architectural insights could influence broader AI system design. The proposal clearly articulates how it could advance the field of Agentic AI for Science, making it highly significant to the workshop's goals."
