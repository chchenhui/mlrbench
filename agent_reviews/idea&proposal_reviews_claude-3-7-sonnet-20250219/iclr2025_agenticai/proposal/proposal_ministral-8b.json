    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The DecompAI proposal aligns well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses Thrust 1 of the workshop by developing an agentic AI system for scientific discovery through multi-agent decomposition. The proposal incorporates game-theoretic utility functions mentioned in the literature review and focuses on hypothesis generation as emphasized in the task description. The four specialized agents (Domain Explorer, Knowledge Retriever, Inferential Reasoner, and Experimental Validator) are consistent with the modular approach outlined in the research idea. The evaluation on chemical synthesis and genetic pathway discovery benchmarks aligns with the practical applications focus area. However, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed some aspects of Thrust 2 (theoretical foundations) and Thrust 4 (open problems) from the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-structured and articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are clearly defined. The four specialized agents and their roles are well-explained, and the evaluation metrics are specified. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification. The proposal lacks specific details on the implementation of the game-theoretic utility functions and how they will balance cooperation and divergence among agents. The dynamic knowledge graph is mentioned but not thoroughly explained in terms of its structure and how it facilitates agent communication. Additionally, the experimental design section could be more detailed regarding the specific datasets to be used and the experimental protocols."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates moderate novelty by combining several existing concepts in a potentially useful way. The multi-agent decomposition approach for hypothesis generation is similar to existing systems like AstroAgents and SciAgents mentioned in the literature review. The use of game-theoretic utility functions to balance cooperation and divergence is interesting but builds upon existing work in multi-agent trust region optimization. The domain-specific fine-tuning of agents adds some novelty, but the overall framework doesn't introduce fundamentally new concepts or methods. The proposal adapts and integrates existing approaches rather than proposing groundbreaking innovations. While the application to chemical synthesis and genetic pathway discovery provides some domain-specific novelty, the core methodological approach shares significant similarities with prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately sound but has some gaps in its theoretical foundations and methodology. The multi-agent framework is well-conceived and builds on established concepts in AI research. However, the game-theoretic utility functions, which are central to the proposal, are not rigorously defined or justified. The proposal mentions these functions will balance cooperation and divergence but doesn't provide mathematical formulations or explain how they will be implemented. The evaluation metrics (hypothesis novelty, scientific validity, resource efficiency) are appropriate but lack detailed explanation of how they will be quantitatively measured. The domain-specific fine-tuning process is mentioned but not elaborated in terms of specific techniques or approaches. While the overall approach is reasonable, these gaps in technical detail and rigor limit the soundness of the proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally feasible with existing technology and methods. The multi-agent framework builds on established AI techniques and can be implemented using current large language models and knowledge graph technologies. The domain-specific fine-tuning is a well-understood process, though potentially resource-intensive. The evaluation on chemical synthesis and genetic pathway discovery benchmarks is practical, assuming access to relevant datasets. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require considerable effort. Designing effective game-theoretic utility functions that properly balance cooperation and divergence could be complex. The integration of the four specialized agents and ensuring effective communication through the dynamic knowledge graph may present technical challenges. Overall, while the proposal is implementable, it would require significant engineering effort and expertise in multiple domains."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important challenge in AI-driven scientific discovery: improving the quality of automatically generated hypotheses. If successful, DecompAI could significantly enhance the relevance, testability, and novelty of AI-generated scientific hypotheses, potentially accelerating discovery in fields like chemistry and genetics. The focus on reducing hallucination and increasing transparency in reasoning chains addresses critical limitations of current AI systems. The multi-agent approach could provide a valuable framework for future research in agentic AI for science. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the innovation and the focus on specific application domains. While valuable, the proposal doesn't present a transformative approach that would fundamentally change how AI is used across all scientific disciplines. The impact would likely be meaningful but contained to specific research areas."
