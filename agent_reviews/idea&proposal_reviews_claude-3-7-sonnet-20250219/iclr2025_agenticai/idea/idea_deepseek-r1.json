    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, particularly with Thrust 1 of the workshop. It directly addresses 'multi-agent decomposition design' by proposing a framework where specialized AI agents collaborate via a knowledge graph. The idea incorporates human-in-the-loop elements for validation and guidance, which matches the workshop's focus on human-AI collaboration. The proposal targets cross-domain scientific hypothesis generation, which is central to the workshop's theme. However, it could more explicitly address some aspects of Thrust 2 (theoretical foundations) and Thrust 4 (validation and reproducibility challenges), though it does touch on these implicitly."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main components, and expected outcomes. The framework's key elements (specialized agents, meta-agent orchestration, knowledge graph, human interface) are defined, and a concrete application domain (drug discovery) is provided. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration: (1) the specific mechanisms for knowledge representation in the shared graph, (2) details on how the adaptive communication protocols would function, (3) more precise metrics for evaluating hypothesis quality, and (4) clearer explanation of how conflicts between agents would be resolved. These ambiguities prevent the idea from receiving a higher clarity score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements: (1) domain-specialized agents collaborating through a dynamic framework rather than a static system, (2) adaptive task decomposition and assignment using reinforcement learning, (3) integration of human expertise at strategic points in the workflow, and (4) application to cross-domain scientific challenges. While multi-agent systems and human-AI collaboration are not new concepts individually, their integration for cross-domain scientific hypothesis generation with dynamic orchestration represents a fresh approach. However, the proposal shares similarities with existing work in collaborative AI systems and doesn't present a fundamentally revolutionary paradigm, which prevents it from scoring in the highest range."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, it builds on existing technologies (LLMs, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning) and proposes a concrete application domain (drug discovery). However, significant challenges include: (1) creating truly domain-specialized agents with deep expertise across multiple scientific fields, (2) developing effective communication protocols between heterogeneous agents, (3) designing a meta-agent capable of optimal task decomposition and assignment, (4) creating a knowledge representation that works across domains, and (5) integrating human feedback effectively without creating bottlenecks. These challenges don't make the idea impractical, but they would require substantial resources and expertise to overcome, justifying the moderate feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical challenge in scientific discovery: the integration of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. If successful, this framework could significantly accelerate interdisciplinary research in areas like drug discovery, materials science, and climate modeling where breakthroughs often require insights from multiple domains. The potential impact is substantial as it could: (1) reduce the time and resources needed for scientific hypothesis generation, (2) uncover novel connections between fields that human researchers might miss, (3) make specialized knowledge more accessible across disciplines, and (4) provide a structured approach to human-AI collaboration in science. The focus on maintaining human oversight also addresses important concerns about AI reliability in scientific contexts. The significance is high, though not revolutionary enough to warrant the highest possible score."
