        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on temporal graph learning, specifically targeting the hyperbolic temporal graphs topic mentioned in the task description. The proposal fully implements the core idea of combining hyperbolic geometry with contrastive learning for temporal graphs as outlined in the research idea. It comprehensively incorporates insights from the literature review, building upon works like HGWaveNet, HGCL, and HTGN while addressing the identified challenges of integrating hyperbolic geometry with temporal dynamics and implementing contrastive learning in hyperbolic space. The methodology section thoroughly details how these elements are combined, with clear mathematical formulations that are consistent with the hyperbolic geometry principles discussed in the cited literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical concepts are explained thoroughly with precise mathematical formulations, especially in the methodology section where hyperbolic operations, graph convolutions, and contrastive learning mechanisms are defined explicitly. The research objectives are clearly stated, and the experimental setup is well-detailed. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the explanation of how the temporal memory module interacts with the contrastive learning framework could be more explicit, (2) some of the mathematical notations in the hyperbolic operations might be challenging for readers not familiar with hyperbolic geometry, and (3) the transition between different components of the methodology could be smoother to better illustrate their integration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly novel approach by synergistically combining three key elements that have not been integrated before: hyperbolic graph neural networks, temporal learning mechanisms, and contrastive learning. While individual components like hyperbolic GNNs (HGCN, HGNN) and temporal graph networks (TGN, TGAT) exist in the literature, their combination with contrastive learning specifically designed for temporal dynamics in hyperbolic space is innovative. The temporal memory module that operates in hyperbolic space to capture long-range dependencies is particularly novel. The time-aware augmentation strategies for contrastive learning in temporal graphs also represent a fresh approach. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work like HTGN and HGWaveNet by introducing the contrastive learning framework specifically adapted for hyperbolic temporal graphs, addressing a gap in existing research."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations, building upon established principles of hyperbolic geometry, graph neural networks, and contrastive learning. The mathematical formulations for hyperbolic operations, graph convolutions, and the contrastive loss function are technically correct and well-justified. The methodology is rigorous in defining the components of the HyTECL framework, with clear explanations of how operations in hyperbolic space are performed. However, there are some areas that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the choice of specific hyperbolic operations for the temporal memory module could be better motivated, (2) the theoretical analysis of why the proposed contrastive learning approach would work better in hyperbolic space than in Euclidean space is somewhat limited, and (3) there is limited discussion of potential theoretical limitations or edge cases where the approach might not perform optimally. The experimental setup is comprehensive, but some of the expected performance improvements could benefit from more rigorous theoretical backing."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with a clear implementation path. The authors specify the use of PyTorch and the geoopt library for hyperbolic operations, which are established tools for implementing such models. The hyperparameters and optimization details are well-specified, indicating practical implementation knowledge. The datasets chosen (ICEWS18, GDELT, YELP, ELLIPTIC, IEEE-CIS) are appropriate and publicly available. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) operations in hyperbolic space are computationally intensive, and while the proposal acknowledges this, it doesn't fully address how to mitigate potential scalability issues for very large graphs, (2) the memory requirements for storing temporal information across multiple timestamps could be substantial, especially for the larger datasets mentioned, and (3) the complexity of implementing and debugging hyperbolic operations combined with temporal dynamics and contrastive learning might present practical challenges. The proposal would benefit from more discussion on computational complexity analysis and potential implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses important challenges in temporal graph learning with significant potential impact. The ability to better model hierarchical structures in temporal graphs could substantially improve performance on tasks like knowledge graph completion and fraud detection, which have real-world applications in information systems and financial security. The expected performance improvements (5-10% on knowledge graph completion, 3-7% on fraud detection) would represent meaningful advances in these domains. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications across financial security, knowledge discovery, social network analysis, and computational biology. The proposal also makes theoretical contributions to geometric deep learning by exploring the intersection of hyperbolic geometry and temporal learning. The significance is further enhanced by the potential for more efficient representations (30-50% parameter reduction) and better handling of sparse data, which are common challenges in real-world graph applications. The proposal clearly articulates how addressing the limitations of existing approaches could lead to substantial improvements in both theoretical understanding and practical applications."
