    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on temporal graph learning, specifically targeting 'Hyperbolic Temporal Graphs' as mentioned in the task description. The proposal fully implements the core idea presented in the research idea of combining hyperbolic graph neural networks with contrastive temporal learning (HyTECL). It comprehensively incorporates the literature review by building upon works like HGCN [5,9], HTGN [3], and adapting contrastive learning approaches [2,7] to hyperbolic space for temporal graphs. The proposal addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the integration of hyperbolic geometry with temporal dynamics and contrastive learning in hyperbolic space. The only minor inconsistency is that some references in the proposal don't perfectly match the literature review numbering, but this doesn't affect the overall coherence."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated and structured in a logical, easy-to-follow manner. The introduction clearly establishes the background, motivation, and objectives. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the hyperbolic space preliminaries, the three main components of the framework (hyperbolic graph convolution, temporal contrastive learning, and hyperbolic temporal memory), and the overall algorithm. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined. The experimental design and expected outcomes are clearly outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation of the hyperbolic projection head for contrastive learning could be more explicitly defined, (2) some of the hyperbolic operations in the memory module are complex and might benefit from further elaboration, and (3) the interaction between the contrastive learning objective and the task-specific objectives could be more thoroughly explained in terms of their relative contributions to the learning process."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of three key components: hyperbolic graph neural networks, temporal contrastive learning, and hyperbolic memory mechanisms. While each individual component has precedents in the literature (hyperbolic GNNs [5,9], contrastive learning for graphs [7], hyperbolic temporal networks [3]), their combination into a unified framework represents a significant innovation. The adaptation of contrastive learning specifically for temporal graphs in hyperbolic space is particularly novel, as is the design of temporal view generation strategies tailored for hyperbolic representations. The hyperbolic temporal memory module also offers a fresh approach to capturing long-range dependencies in non-Euclidean space. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work like HTGN [3] and HGCL [2] by focusing on the synergistic combination of contrastive learning with hyperbolic geometry for temporal dynamics, rather than just adapting one component to the other. While not entirely groundbreaking in creating new fundamental techniques, the novel combination and adaptation of existing methods to address the specific challenges of hierarchical temporal graphs represents a significant contribution to the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations of hyperbolic geometry, graph neural networks, and contrastive learning. The mathematical formulations for hyperbolic operations are correct and well-presented. The methodology logically extends existing work in hyperbolic GNNs and temporal graph learning with appropriate justifications. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) The stability of the hyperbolic memory module might face numerical challenges that aren't fully addressed, particularly when combining multiple hyperbolic operations in sequence; (2) The proposal doesn't thoroughly discuss potential gradient issues when backpropagating through hyperbolic operations; (3) The justification for specific design choices in the temporal contrastive learning module (e.g., the choice of augmentations) could be more thoroughly grounded in theory; (4) The interaction between the hyperbolic geometry and the contrastive loss function might introduce optimization challenges that aren't fully explored. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and the technical formulations are mostly correct, with a clear connection to established literature."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach but with several implementation challenges that could impact its practicality. On the positive side, the authors propose to use existing libraries like PyTorch and geoopt for hyperbolic operations, which provides a solid foundation. The experimental design is reasonable, with appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) Implementing stable and efficient hyperbolic operations, especially for the memory module and contrastive learning components, may be numerically challenging and computationally expensive; (2) The combination of hyperbolic geometry with temporal contrastive learning introduces optimization complexities that might require extensive hyperparameter tuning; (3) The scalability to large temporal graphs is questionable given the computational overhead of hyperbolic operations; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address potential numerical stability issues when combining multiple hyperbolic operations in sequence; (5) The memory requirements for storing temporal states in hyperbolic space for all nodes across time could be substantial for large graphs. While the approach is implementable with current technology, these challenges suggest that considerable engineering effort and computational resources would be required to realize the full framework as described."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem at the intersection of temporal graph learning and hierarchical structure modeling. If successful, HyTECL would make significant contributions to both methodological advancement and practical applications. The potential impact is substantial across multiple domains: (1) In financial security, better modeling of evolving fraud networks could lead to improved detection systems; (2) In knowledge graph forecasting, capturing hierarchical relationships could significantly enhance prediction accuracy; (3) In social network analysis, modeling community evolution with hierarchical awareness could provide deeper insights. The proposal directly aligns with the workshop's focus on temporal graph learning and addresses key challenges in the field. The methodological contribution of integrating hyperbolic geometry with contrastive learning for temporal graphs is significant and could inspire new research directions. The proposal also includes comprehensive evaluation plans to demonstrate the method's effectiveness. While the impact might be somewhat limited by the specialized nature of the approach (focusing specifically on hierarchical temporal graphs), the overall significance is high given the prevalence of hierarchical structures in many real-world dynamic networks and the current limitations of existing methods in capturing such structures."
