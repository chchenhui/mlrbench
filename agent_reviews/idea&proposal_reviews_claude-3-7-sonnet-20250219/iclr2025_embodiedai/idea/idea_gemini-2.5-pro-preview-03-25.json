        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on embodied intelligence with LLMs in open city environments. It directly addresses the first topic of 'Spatial Intelligence and Embodied Perception with LLM Agents in Open City Environment' by proposing a framework to ground LLMs' spatial and temporal reasoning in embodied sensor streams. The idea tackles the specific challenge mentioned in the workshop description about LLM agents struggling in outdoor environments with tasks like navigation and spatial reasoning. The proposal to create a structured spatio-temporal representation that integrates with LLMs addresses the workshop's interest in techniques for integrating spatial intelligence and embodied perception for LLM agents in outdoor environments."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (LLMs lacking dynamic spatial awareness), proposes a specific solution (continuous grounding via sensor streams and structured representations), and outlines expected outcomes (improved instruction following, spatial query answering, and situational awareness). The technical approach involving perception modules, dynamic scene graphs with timestamps, and integration methods is well-articulated. However, some minor ambiguities exist around the specific mechanisms for integrating the spatio-temporal representation into the LLM's context (mentioning both fine-tuning and specialized input tokens without committing to a specific approach), which prevents it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to continuous grounding of LLMs in dynamic urban environments. While grounding LLMs in perception is not entirely new, the focus on continuous temporal aspects and dynamic urban environments represents a fresh perspective. The proposed dynamic scene graph with timestamps and relative coordinates offers an innovative representation for bridging perception and language models. However, the core components (perception modules, scene graphs, LLM integration) build upon existing research directions rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms. The novelty lies more in the specific application to dynamic urban environments and the continuous temporal aspect rather than in revolutionary new techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. The perception module for extracting dynamic objects, landmarks, and self-motion from urban environments requires sophisticated computer vision and sensor fusion techniques that are non-trivial in uncontrolled outdoor settings. Creating accurate dynamic scene graphs with temporal information in real-time presents additional challenges. The integration with LLMs, whether through fine-tuning or specialized tokens, would require significant engineering and potentially large computational resources. While all components are technically possible with current technology, combining them into a cohesive system that works reliably in complex urban environments would require considerable effort, expertise across multiple domains, and potentially significant resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant limitation in current LLM agents - their inability to effectively reason about dynamic spatial and temporal relationships in real-world environments. Successfully implementing this framework could substantially advance embodied AI in urban settings, enabling applications in autonomous navigation, assistive technologies, and human-robot collaboration in cities. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in urban mobility, accessibility, and smart city technologies. The significance is particularly high given the workshop's focus on outdoor environments, where current LLM agents struggle significantly compared to controlled indoor settings. This work could bridge an important gap between language models and embodied intelligence in complex real-world scenarios."
