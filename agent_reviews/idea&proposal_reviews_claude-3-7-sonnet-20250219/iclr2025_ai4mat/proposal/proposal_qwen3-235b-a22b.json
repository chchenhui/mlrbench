        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the AI4Mat workshop's themes of building foundation models for materials science and developing next-generation representations of materials data. The proposal's focus on multi-modal integration through contrastive learning is consistent with the research idea of creating unified material representations. The methodology incorporates relevant literature, citing all the papers mentioned in the review, including GNN approaches [1-4], contrastive learning techniques [5], and recent AI breakthroughs in materials discovery [6-7]. The proposal comprehensively addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly multi-modal data integration, contrastive learning optimization, and GNN scalability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, with mathematical formulations of the GNN architecture, contrastive loss function, and training protocol. The three modalities (structural, textual, and visual) are clearly defined, along with their respective encoders. The experimental design, including baselines, downstream tasks, and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly described. However, there are minor areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as more details on how the modality-agnostic projection head works and how the model handles missing modalities in real-world scenarios. The proposal could also benefit from more explicit connections between the mathematical formulations and their practical implementations."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing COMMA, a framework that aligns multiple material data modalities (structural, textual, and visual) into a unified representation space using contrastive learning. While contrastive learning and multi-modal alignment have been explored in other domains (e.g., CLIP for image-text), their application to materials science with the specific combination of GNNs for structures, Transformers for synthesis protocols, and ViTs for characterization images represents a fresh approach. The modality-invariant contrastive loss function is adapted specifically for materials science data. However, the core techniques (GNNs, Transformers, contrastive learning) are established methods being applied to a new domain rather than fundamentally new algorithmic innovations. The proposal builds upon existing work rather than introducing entirely novel concepts."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods. The mathematical formulations for the GNN architecture, contrastive loss function, and training protocol are correctly presented and justified. The choice of encoders for each modality (GNNs for structures, Transformers for text, ViTs for images) is appropriate given their proven effectiveness in their respective domains. The experimental design includes comprehensive baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The data collection and preprocessing steps are well-defined, with attention to data quality and augmentation techniques. The training protocol is detailed with specific hyperparameters. However, there could be more discussion on potential failure modes of the contrastive learning approach and how to address them, particularly when dealing with noisy or incomplete data across modalities."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The computational resources required (4Ã—NVIDIA A100 GPUs) are substantial but accessible in academic or industrial research settings. The datasets mentioned (Materials Project, MatBERT Corpus, NIST-EM Image Database) are available and appropriate for the task. The training protocol is well-defined with realistic hyperparameters. However, there are feasibility concerns regarding the alignment of heterogeneous data modalities, particularly ensuring that sufficient paired data (structure-text-image triplets) exists for effective contrastive learning. The proposal acknowledges limitations regarding scalability for systems larger than 200 atoms and handling missing modalities, which are significant practical challenges. The implementation of the hierarchical Transformer for synthesis protocols may also require considerable engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in materials science: the integration of heterogeneous data modalities to enable holistic material understanding. If successful, COMMA could significantly accelerate materials discovery by revealing cross-modal correlations that single-modality approaches miss. The expected outcomes include the first open-source dataset of aligned cross-modal embeddings, which could serve as a foundation for future multi-modal foundation models in materials science. The proposal directly aligns with the AI4Mat workshop's themes and has potential applications in energy storage, semiconductors, and sustainable materials. The broader impact includes accelerating materials discovery for climate mitigation technologies (batteries, carbon-capture catalysts) and lowering barriers for cross-disciplinary research through community toolkits. The quantitative improvements targeted (15% reduction in bandgap prediction RMSE, 20% improvement in synthesis protocol retrieval) would represent meaningful advances in the field."
