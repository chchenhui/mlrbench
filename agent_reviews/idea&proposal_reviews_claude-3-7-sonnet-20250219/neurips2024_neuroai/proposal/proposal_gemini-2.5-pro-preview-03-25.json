        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeuroAI workshop's focus on neuro-inspired computations and self-supervised systems by developing a framework that integrates predictive coding and active inference principles into reinforcement learning. The proposal builds upon the literature review, specifically citing and extending work by Rao et al. on Active Predictive Coding Networks and addressing the sample efficiency challenge identified in the literature. The methodology section thoroughly explains how predictive coding and active inference will be implemented, maintaining consistency with the theoretical foundations mentioned in the literature. The proposal also acknowledges computational efficiency concerns raised in the SPEQ paper from the literature review."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research problem, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The theoretical framework of Predictive Coding and Active Inference is explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the underlying principles accessible. The algorithmic steps are presented in a logical sequence, and the experimental design is thoroughly detailed. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as the exact implementation details of the Expected Free Energy calculation and how the hierarchical structure of the PC network will be designed. Additionally, while the proposal mentions computational complexity as a challenge, it could more explicitly address how the approach will balance the trade-off between sample efficiency and computational cost."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of predictive coding and active inference principles into reinforcement learning. While individual components (PC networks, world models in RL) have been explored before, the comprehensive framework that uses Expected Free Energy minimization as the core action selection mechanism represents a significant innovation. The approach differs from standard model-based RL by explicitly incorporating uncertainty reduction and information-seeking behavior through a principled neuroscience-inspired framework rather than ad-hoc exploration heuristics. The proposal builds upon existing work (e.g., Rao et al.'s Active Predictive Coding) but extends it substantially by formalizing the action selection process through EFE minimization and creating a complete RL framework. The novelty lies not in inventing entirely new algorithms but in the unique synthesis of neuroscience theories with RL in a way that addresses a critical challenge (sample efficiency)."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on solid theoretical foundations from computational neuroscience (predictive coding and active inference) and reinforcement learning. The mathematical formulations of variational free energy and expected free energy are correctly presented, and the algorithmic steps follow logically from these principles. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics to test the central hypotheses. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns that aren't fully addressed: (1) The scalability of EFE calculation for complex environments or long planning horizons, (2) The potential instability in training deep predictive coding networks, and (3) The exact formulation of the pragmatic value component when integrating traditional RL reward signals. While the proposal acknowledges these challenges, it could provide more detailed technical solutions. The methodology is generally sound but would benefit from more rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence properties and computational complexity."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces significant implementation challenges. The computational complexity of calculating Expected Free Energy for multiple action sequences using a learned world model is substantial, especially for environments with high-dimensional state spaces or long planning horizons. While the proposal acknowledges this challenge and suggests some mitigation strategies (approximations, efficient planning techniques), these solutions may themselves introduce additional complexity. The stability of training deep predictive coding networks is another concern that could impact feasibility. The experimental design is reasonable, starting with simpler environments before potentially scaling to more complex ones like Atari games. However, the timeline and computational resources required are not explicitly addressed, which raises questions about practical implementation. The proposal would be more feasible if it included a phased approach, starting with simplified versions of the framework before incorporating all components."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning - sample efficiency - which has broad implications for the practical application of RL in real-world scenarios where data collection is expensive or limited. If successful, the research could significantly advance the field of NeuroAI by demonstrating how neuroscience-inspired principles can lead to tangible improvements in AI capabilities. The work bridges computational neuroscience and machine learning in a meaningful way, potentially offering insights in both directions. The framework could enable applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and other domains where data efficiency is critical. Additionally, the principled approach to exploration through Expected Free Energy minimization could influence how intrinsic motivation is implemented in future RL algorithms. The significance extends beyond the specific implementation to the broader paradigm of using brain-inspired computational principles to address AI limitations."
