    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the NeuroAI workshop's focus on neuro-inspired computations and self-supervised systems, particularly leveraging predictive coding and active inference principles as specified in the task description. The proposal faithfully expands on the core idea of using predictive coding-driven active inference for data-efficient reinforcement learning, developing it into a comprehensive research plan. The methodology incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including hierarchical predictive coding networks (from Rao et al.), free energy minimization (from Ororbia et al.), and even borrows the stabilization phase concept from SPEQ (Romeo et al.). The proposal addresses all the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation balance, and biologically plausible learning mechanisms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding rather than obscuring it. The hierarchical predictive coding architecture and action selection mechanism via expected free energy minimization are explained in detail with clear equations. The experimental design section provides specific environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact implementation details of the meta-policy π_meta could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the stabilization phase and the active inference framework could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'predictive coding units') are introduced without full explanation of their internal workings."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several concepts in a novel way. The combination of hierarchical predictive coding with active inference for reinforcement learning represents a fresh approach to the sample efficiency problem. The use of expected free energy minimization as an intrinsic motivation mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation is innovative in the RL context. The integration of a stabilization phase inspired by SPEQ into this neuro-inspired framework is also original. However, the core components (predictive coding, active inference, hierarchical models) are established concepts in the literature, as evidenced by the cited works. The proposal builds upon these existing frameworks rather than introducing fundamentally new theoretical constructs. The novelty lies primarily in the specific integration and application of these concepts to address sample efficiency in RL, rather than in developing entirely new computational principles."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for hierarchical predictive coding and expected free energy minimization are correctly presented and consistent with established literature. The free energy principle and active inference framework are well-established in computational neuroscience, providing a rigorous basis for the approach. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, environments, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are well-conceived to isolate the contributions of different components. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from more rigorous justification: (1) the computational tractability of minimizing expected free energy in high-dimensional action spaces is not fully addressed, (2) the proposal assumes that hierarchical predictive coding will lead to better generalization without providing theoretical guarantees, and (3) while the approach is inspired by neuroscience, the exact mapping between the proposed computational mechanisms and actual neural processes could be more precisely articulated."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The hierarchical predictive coding architecture can be implemented using existing deep learning frameworks, and the active inference approach has been demonstrated in simpler settings. The experimental environments (Montezuma's Revenge, MuJoCo AntMaze, Meta-World ML45) are established benchmarks with available implementations. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) computing the expected free energy for action selection may be computationally intensive, especially in environments with continuous or high-dimensional action spaces, (2) training hierarchical models with multiple layers of prediction can be unstable and may require careful hyperparameter tuning, (3) the proposal aims for a 30-50% reduction in sample complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods like DreamerV3, which is ambitious given the complexity of the approach, and (4) the integration of the stabilization phase with the active inference framework adds another layer of complexity. While challenging, these issues do not render the proposal infeasible, but they do suggest that significant engineering effort will be required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning—sample efficiency—which has significant implications for real-world applications where data collection is costly or time-sensitive. If successful, the approach could enable RL in domains previously considered impractical, such as robotics and healthcare. The bridging of computational neuroscience and AI aligns perfectly with the NeuroAI workshop's goals and could lead to meaningful cross-fertilization between fields. The focus on biologically plausible learning mechanisms could provide insights into brain function while advancing AI capabilities. The potential 30-50% reduction in sample complexity would represent a substantial improvement over current methods. The hierarchical nature of the approach could also enhance interpretability and generalization across tasks. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the proposal focuses primarily on improving existing RL paradigms rather than introducing a fundamentally new learning paradigm, and the real-world impact depends on whether the approach can scale to truly complex environments beyond standard benchmarks."
