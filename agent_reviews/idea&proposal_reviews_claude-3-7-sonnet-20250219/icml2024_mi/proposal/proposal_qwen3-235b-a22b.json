    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on challenging assumptions in human feedback models for AI alignment, particularly the assumption of human rationality. The proposal incorporates bounded rationality frameworks from cognitive science as suggested in the task topics, and builds upon inverse reinforcement learning methods mentioned in the literature review. The hierarchical Bayesian approach for joint preference-effort learning is consistent with the research idea of developing a 'cognitive effort-aware feedback model.' The proposal also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as modeling cognitive effort, integrating bounded rationality frameworks, and identifying systematic biases. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes adversarial and robust IRL approaches, the proposal doesn't explicitly incorporate adversarial methods in its framework."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The theoretical framework is presented with precise mathematical formulations that explain how cognitive effort influences human feedback. The hierarchical Bayesian inference approach is well-defined, with clear explanations of latent variables, likelihood functions, and inference methods. The experimental design, including dataset requirements and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the connection between the free-energy theorem and the proposed model could be more explicitly explained, (2) the specific implementation details of the MCMC sampling approach could be elaborated, and (3) the transition from theoretical formulation to practical algorithm could be more detailed, particularly regarding how the GP prior is specified and updated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a fresh and innovative approach to human-AI alignment by explicitly modeling cognitive effort as a key factor in human feedback. While inverse reinforcement learning and bounded rationality are established concepts, their integration in this specific context represents a novel contribution. The hierarchical Bayesian framework for jointly inferring preferences and effort levels is particularly innovative, as it addresses a gap in current alignment methods that typically assume perfect rationality. The proposal's emphasis on quantifying systematic biases introduced by cognitive shortcuts also represents a novel direction. However, some components of the methodology, such as using Gaussian Processes for preference modeling and MCMC for inference, are relatively standard techniques in Bayesian machine learning, which slightly reduces the overall novelty score. Nevertheless, the application of these techniques to the specific problem of modeling cognitive effort in human feedback represents a significant advancement over existing approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations from bounded rationality and Bayesian inference. The mathematical formulation of the cognitive effort model using the KL divergence is well-justified and aligns with established information-theoretic approaches to bounded rationality. The hierarchical Bayesian framework for inference is appropriate for the problem at hand, and the proposed MCMC sampling approach is a valid method for approximating the posterior distribution. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from more rigorous justification: (1) the assumption that effort levels follow a Gamma distribution is not thoroughly justified, (2) the proposal mentions using sparsity in the GP kernel for computational efficiency but doesn't provide details on how this would be implemented, and (3) while the model accounts for task-specific effort levels, it doesn't fully address how individual differences in cognitive capacity might be incorporated. Additionally, the proposal could benefit from a more detailed error analysis to assess the robustness of the inference procedure under different conditions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach, but with several implementation challenges that could affect its practicality. On the positive side, the use of existing behavioral datasets alongside custom experiments is a pragmatic strategy for data collection. The hierarchical Bayesian framework and MCMC sampling are established methods with available software implementations. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) the computational complexity of GP-based models with MCMC sampling could be prohibitive for large datasets, despite the mentioned sparsity techniques; (2) designing and conducting human-subject studies with controlled effort conditions requires significant resources and expertise in experimental psychology; (3) obtaining ground-truth preferences for evaluation is inherently difficult, as the true preferences are latent; and (4) the validation strategy relies on splitting data by task complexity, which assumes this information is available or can be reliably inferred. While the proposal acknowledges some of these challenges, it doesn't provide detailed mitigation strategies for all of them, suggesting moderate implementation difficulties."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental issue in AI alignment that has significant implications for both theory and practice. By challenging the assumption of perfect rationality in human feedback models, it targets a critical gap in current alignment methods that could lead to substantial improvements in AI systems' ability to understand and align with human intentions. The potential impact spans multiple domains: (1) in theoretical AI safety, it provides a more realistic model of human feedback that could prevent misalignment in high-stakes applications; (2) in practical applications like healthcare and education, it could enhance AI systems' ability to interpret noisy or inconsistent feedback from users under cognitive constraints; and (3) in cognitive science, it offers a computational framework for testing theories of bounded rationality at scale. The anticipated 20% improvement in reward estimation for effort-intensive tasks would represent a meaningful advance in preference inference accuracy. The proposal's interdisciplinary nature, bridging machine learning, cognitive science, and behavioral economics, further enhances its significance by contributing to multiple fields simultaneously."
