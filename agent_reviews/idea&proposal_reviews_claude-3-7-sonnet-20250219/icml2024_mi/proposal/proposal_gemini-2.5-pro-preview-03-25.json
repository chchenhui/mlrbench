    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the Workshop on Mechanistic Interpretability's focus on understanding human feedback models for AI alignment by developing a cognitive effort-aware framework. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the core idea of modeling cognitive effort in human feedback, extending inverse reinforcement learning to account for bounded rationality. It builds upon the literature review by addressing the challenges identified in IRL (from Arora & Doshi), incorporating interpretable behavior models (from Jarrett et al.), and aiming for robustness (from Fu et al.). The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed CE-IRL framework will jointly infer human preferences and effort levels via hierarchical Bayesian inference, exactly as suggested in the research idea. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions the challenge of data collection under varying conditions, the proposal could have elaborated more on specific strategies to overcome this challenge."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The conceptual framework is explained thoroughly, with formal mathematical notation that precisely defines the CE-IRL model. The algorithmic steps are presented in a logical sequence, and the experimental design includes specific validation metrics. The proposal effectively communicates complex ideas about bounded rationality and effort-aware modeling in a comprehensible manner. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The specific functional forms of the effort cost C_φ(τ) could be more concretely defined rather than presenting multiple candidates; (2) The transition between the theoretical model and practical implementation could be more detailed, particularly regarding how the effort parameters would be initialized or constrained; and (3) Some of the mathematical formulations, while correct, might benefit from additional explanation of their intuitive meaning for readers less familiar with probabilistic modeling."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly novel approach by explicitly incorporating cognitive effort into inverse reinforcement learning for AI alignment. While IRL itself is established, the integration of bounded rationality concepts from cognitive science into a formal Bayesian framework for preference inference represents a significant innovation. The CE-IRL framework offers a fresh perspective by modeling human feedback as a trade-off between reward maximization and effort minimization, which addresses a critical gap in current alignment approaches. The proposal's novelty is particularly evident in its formulation of effort-modulated choice models and the hierarchical Bayesian inference approach to jointly estimate reward and effort parameters. The work bridges machine learning with cognitive science in a way that hasn't been thoroughly explored in the existing literature. However, some individual components (like MaxEnt IRL or hierarchical Bayesian modeling) are established techniques being combined in a new way rather than fundamentally new methods, which slightly tempers the novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations by drawing from established frameworks in both machine learning (IRL, Bayesian inference) and cognitive science (bounded rationality, resource rationality). The mathematical formulations for the effort-aware choice models are well-grounded in probability theory and consistent with how humans make decisions under cognitive constraints. The hierarchical Bayesian approach is appropriate for jointly inferring reward and effort parameters while accounting for uncertainty. The experimental design includes appropriate validation metrics and baselines for comparison. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential identifiability issues—whether the model can reliably distinguish between true preferences and effort effects without additional constraints; (2) The effort cost function is not fully specified, with multiple candidates proposed without clear criteria for selection; (3) While the validation approach is comprehensive, the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach; and (4) The connection between the inferred effort parameters and actual cognitive processes could be more rigorously established."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the methodological approach builds on established techniques (IRL, MCMC, Bayesian inference) with available software tools (Stan, PyMC), and the experimental design using both simulated and human data is reasonable. The staged validation approach is pragmatic. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) The joint inference of reward and effort parameters may face identifiability issues in practice, potentially requiring more data than is practical to collect; (2) The human behavioral experiments proposed are complex and potentially costly, requiring careful design to isolate effort effects from other confounds; (3) The computational complexity of MCMC for hierarchical Bayesian inference may become prohibitive for complex environments or reward functions; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address how ground truth preferences would be established for the downstream task evaluation, which is crucial for validating the approach; and (5) The timeline and resource requirements for implementing the full research agenda are not specified, raising questions about practical completion within typical research timeframes."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment approaches by incorporating cognitive effort into preference inference models. This work has significant potential impact across multiple dimensions: (1) Theoretical advancement in AI alignment by providing more realistic models of human feedback, directly addressing the workshop's core themes; (2) Practical improvements in AI systems that can better handle noisy, effort-constrained human feedback in domains like healthcare, education, and autonomous driving; (3) Informing the design of human-AI interaction protocols that account for varying levels of human cognitive capacity; (4) Bridging disciplines by integrating insights from cognitive science into machine learning frameworks; and (5) Contributing to AI safety by improving the fidelity of alignment with true human preferences rather than effort-distorted ones. The significance is particularly high given the growing deployment of AI systems trained with human feedback (e.g., LLMs) and the potential risks of misalignment. The proposal could have scored even higher if it had more explicitly connected to current real-world applications or provided preliminary results suggesting the magnitude of improvement expected."
