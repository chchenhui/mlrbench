    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding human feedback models for AI alignment by exploring cognitive effort as a critical factor in human decision-making. The proposal builds upon the identified gap in current RLHF approaches that assume human rationality, which was highlighted in both the task description and research idea. The methodology incorporates bounded rationality frameworks from cognitive science (mentioned in the task's relevant topics) and extends inverse reinforcement learning approaches discussed in the literature review. The hierarchical Bayesian framework specifically addresses the challenge of modeling cognitive effort identified in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions AIRL as a baseline, it could have been more explicitly integrated into the theoretical framework."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the mathematical formulation of the cognitive effort-aware feedback model is precise and well-defined. The hierarchical Bayesian inference approach is explained thoroughly with appropriate equations. The experimental validation plan is detailed with specific metrics and baselines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact relationship between the effort parameter λ and observable behaviors could be more explicitly defined, (2) the data collection section could provide more details on how ground truth preferences will be established in real-world experiments, and (3) the distinction between the proposed approach and existing IRL methods could be more sharply delineated in some sections."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of cognitive effort dynamics into inverse reinforcement learning for AI alignment. While both IRL and bounded rationality are established concepts individually, their combination in a hierarchical Bayesian framework specifically for modeling effort-accuracy tradeoffs in human feedback is innovative. The proposal extends beyond existing work by explicitly modeling the effort parameter λ as a personalized characteristic and incorporating it into preference inference. The dual-phase data collection strategy combining synthetic and real-world behavioral experiments is also a thoughtful approach. The proposal builds upon existing IRL methods (mentioned in the literature review) but offers a substantive advancement by addressing the critical gap of effort-induced biases. While not entirely groundbreaking (as it builds on established theoretical frameworks), it represents a significant and well-justified novel direction in human-AI alignment research."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations by building on established frameworks in inverse reinforcement learning and cognitive science. The mathematical formulation of the utility function incorporating both reward and effort cost is well-grounded, and the hierarchical Bayesian approach to inference is appropriate for capturing individual differences. The experimental validation plan with multiple baselines and specific metrics is methodologically sound. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address how to validate the effort parameter λ against ground truth (beyond correlations with self-reports, which have known limitations), (2) the assumption that effort follows a Gamma distribution could use more justification, and (3) the computational challenges of performing HMC in high-dimensional spaces are acknowledged but solutions aren't fully elaborated. While these limitations don't undermine the overall approach, they do represent areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps. The data collection strategy is practical, with a reasonable sample size (200 participants) and well-defined experimental conditions. The use of established computational methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference is appropriate. The evaluation metrics are measurable and the comparison against existing baselines is achievable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the computational complexity of the hierarchical Bayesian inference might be challenging for large-scale applications (though this is acknowledged in the expected outcomes), (2) recruiting and maintaining 200 participants for potentially complex decision-making tasks may face practical challenges, (3) establishing ground truth preferences in real-world scenarios (as opposed to synthetic data) is inherently difficult and may affect validation accuracy. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent practical hurdles that would require careful management during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in human-AI alignment that has substantial real-world implications. By modeling cognitive effort in human feedback, the research directly tackles a fundamental limitation in current approaches like RLHF that assume human rationality and consistency. The potential impact spans multiple high-stakes domains including healthcare and education, where accounting for clinician fatigue or teacher cognitive load could significantly improve AI system alignment. The interdisciplinary nature of the work, bridging cognitive science and machine learning, aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals and could catalyze new research directions. The expected improvement of ≥15% in preference inference accuracy would represent a substantial advancement in the field. The proposal also includes plans for open-source tools, which would amplify its impact by enabling broader adoption. Overall, this work addresses a problem of high importance with potentially far-reaching implications for robust AI alignment in real-world settings."
