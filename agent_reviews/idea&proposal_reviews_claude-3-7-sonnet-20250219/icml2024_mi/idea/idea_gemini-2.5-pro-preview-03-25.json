        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on challenging simplistic assumptions in human feedback models for AI alignment. The proposal specifically targets the assumption that 'human feedback directly reflects stable underlying preferences' and introduces cognitive effort as a critical factor affecting feedback quality - which perfectly matches the workshop's goal of better understanding human feedback models. The idea draws from behavioral economics and cognitive science (explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics) and applies to RLHF (a primary topic of interest). The proposal aims to improve AI alignment robustness, which is the central theme of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (ignoring cognitive effort in human feedback), proposes a specific solution (incorporating effort measures into preference models), and outlines concrete implementation steps (collecting proxy measures, modifying Bradley-Terry models). The methodology is well-defined, explaining how the effort-aware reward model would function within the RLHF loop. The only minor ambiguities are in the specifics of how exactly the effort measures would be integrated mathematically into the preference model and how the system would determine which feedback to discount or down-weight. These details would likely be elaborated in a full paper, but the core concept is articulated concisely and comprehensibly."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by introducing cognitive effort as an explicit factor in RLHF preference modeling. While cognitive effort has been studied extensively in behavioral economics and cognitive science, its formal integration into AI alignment and specifically RLHF appears to be an innovative approach. The proposal bridges established knowledge from human sciences with machine learning techniques in a way that hasn't been widely explored. The concept of an 'Effort-Aware Reward Model' that accounts for cognitive load when interpreting human feedback represents a fresh perspective on improving alignment. It's not entirely revolutionary as it builds upon existing preference models, but it introduces a meaningful new dimension to them that addresses a real gap in current approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The proposed proxy measures for cognitive effort (response times, self-reported difficulty) are readily collectible alongside standard preference data. Modifying existing preference models like Bradley-Terry is mathematically tractable. However, several practical challenges exist: (1) accurately measuring cognitive effort is non-trivial and proxy measures may be noisy; (2) determining the appropriate mathematical relationship between effort and preference reliability requires careful experimentation; (3) validating that the effort-aware model actually improves alignment outcomes needs rigorous evaluation frameworks. The research would require interdisciplinary expertise spanning cognitive science and machine learning, but doesn't require any technological breakthroughs or prohibitively expensive resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental limitation in current RLHF approaches that could have far-reaching implications. By accounting for cognitive effort in human feedback, the work could significantly improve the quality of learned reward models, especially in complex domains where human evaluators face high cognitive loads. This would directly enhance AI alignment in sophisticated systems like large language models. The significance extends beyond theoretical interest - it could lead to practical improvements in how human feedback is collected and weighted in production AI systems. The approach also opens a pathway for incorporating other human cognitive factors into alignment techniques. While the immediate impact might be limited to research contexts, the long-term potential for improving alignment in deployed AI systems is substantial."
