        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on mechanistic interpretability and human-AI alignment. It directly addresses the workshop's critique of simplistic human feedback models by challenging the assumption that humans act rationally when providing feedback. The proposal specifically targets the cognitive effort dimension of human feedback, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics (Cognitive Science - Effort in Decision-Making). The work draws from bounded rationality frameworks, which is also listed as a relevant topic. The idea connects to RLHF and inverse reinforcement learning, both of which are core topics for the workshop. Overall, the proposal is highly relevant to the task description, addressing the fundamental challenge of understanding human feedback for better AI alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (ignoring cognitive effort in human feedback models), the proposed solution (a cognitive effort-aware feedback model), the methodological approach (integrating effort dynamics into inverse reinforcement learning via hierarchical Bayesian inference), and expected outcomes. The connection to bounded rationality frameworks provides a solid theoretical grounding. The only minor ambiguities are in the specifics of how the hierarchical Bayesian inference would be implemented and what exact metrics would be used to quantify 'effort levels.' While these details would likely be elaborated in a full paper, a slightly more concrete description of the experimental setup and evaluation metrics would have made the idea even clearer."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by addressing a critical gap in current human feedback models for AI alignment. While bounded rationality and cognitive effort have been studied extensively in cognitive science and behavioral economics, their systematic integration into AI alignment frameworks, particularly RLHF and inverse reinforcement learning, represents a fresh approach. The proposal to jointly infer both preferences and effort levels is innovative, as most existing approaches treat human feedback as a direct, albeit noisy, reflection of preferences without modeling the effort-accuracy tradeoff explicitly. The hierarchical Bayesian framework for this joint inference appears to be a novel methodological contribution. While some work exists on modeling biases in human feedback, the specific focus on cognitive effort as a structured source of misalignment is relatively unexplored in the AI alignment literature."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The proposal to collect behavioral data with humans providing feedback under varying task complexities is straightforward and has precedent in cognitive science research. The hierarchical Bayesian inference approach is well-established, though applying it to jointly infer preferences and effort levels may require careful model design. The main challenges lie in: (1) accurately quantifying cognitive effort in experimental settings, (2) developing a computational model that captures the relationship between effort and decision quality, and (3) validating that the inferred 'true preferences' actually reflect what humans would choose under ideal conditions. These challenges are substantial but not insurmountable given existing methods in cognitive science and Bayesian modeling. The research would likely require interdisciplinary expertise and careful experimental design, but remains within the capabilities of current research methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental limitation in current AI alignment approaches that could have far-reaching implications. By explicitly modeling cognitive effort in human feedback, the work could significantly improve the robustness of preference learning systems across numerous applications. The significance is particularly high because: (1) it tackles a systematic source of misalignment that affects virtually all human feedback-based systems, (2) it could lead to more accurate preference inference in high-stakes domains like healthcare and education where cognitive limitations are especially relevant, (3) it bridges theoretical insights from cognitive science with practical AI alignment techniques, and (4) it could inform the design of feedback elicitation interfaces that account for human cognitive limitations. If successful, this research could establish a new paradigm for human-AI alignment that acknowledges and accommodates the bounded rationality of human feedback providers, representing a major advancement in the field."
