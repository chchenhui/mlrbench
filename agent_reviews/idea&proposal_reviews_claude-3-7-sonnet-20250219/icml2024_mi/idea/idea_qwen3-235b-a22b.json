    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses human-AI alignment by challenging the assumption of human rationality in IRL, which is explicitly mentioned as a problematic assumption in the workshop overview. The proposal incorporates bounded rationality models from behavioral economics and cognitive science, both of which are listed as relevant topics. The idea spans multiple domains mentioned in the task (robotics, recommendation systems) and focuses on improving human feedback models, which is a central theme of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other feedback types mentioned in the workshop (like RLHF for LLMs), though the principles could potentially extend there."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly identifies the problem (IRL assuming full rationality), proposes a specific solution (integrating bounded rationality models), and outlines concrete implementation details (using neuroimaging/eye-tracking data, Bayesian inference for joint recovery of reward functions and noise parameters). The evaluation approach is also well-defined (benchmarking against traditional IRL methods). The only minor ambiguities are in the specifics of how the neuroimaging/eye-tracking data would be practically incorporated into the IRL framework and how the 'noise parameters' would be precisely formulated mathematically, which would need further elaboration in a full proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows notable originality by challenging a fundamental assumption in IRL. While bounded rationality has been studied extensively in behavioral economics and some work exists on incorporating human biases into machine learning models, the specific integration of bounded rationality models with neuroimaging/eye-tracking data into IRL appears to be a fresh approach. However, the concept of accounting for suboptimal human behavior in IRL is not entirely new - there have been previous attempts to model noisy or inconsistent human demonstrations. The innovation lies more in the comprehensive integration of cognitive science measurements and specific bias models rather than in creating an entirely new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea faces several implementation challenges that affect its feasibility. While IRL methods and bounded rationality models both exist, integrating them presents technical difficulties. The proposal to use neuroimaging/eye-tracking data adds significant complexity - collecting such data at scale would be resource-intensive, and mapping low-level physiological signals to high-level cognitive biases remains challenging. The Bayesian inference approach for joint recovery of reward functions and noise parameters would likely require sophisticated approximation methods to be computationally tractable. These challenges don't make the research impossible, but they do suggest considerable effort would be needed, potentially requiring multiple research phases and interdisciplinary collaboration."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in human-AI alignment that has broad implications. By improving the accuracy of inferred human preferences from suboptimal demonstrations, it could significantly enhance safety in high-stakes domains like robotics and healthcare, as mentioned in the proposal. The significance is heightened by the growing deployment of AI systems that learn from human feedback. If successful, this approach could become a foundational improvement to IRL methods used across various applications. The impact extends beyond technical improvements to addressing fundamental safety concerns about AI systems misinterpreting human intentions, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on better understanding human feedback for alignment."
