    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses 'privacy for large language models' and 'efficient methods for privacy preserving machine learning,' which are explicitly mentioned in the topics of interest. The proposal also touches on 'differential privacy theory and practice' by integrating DP with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The idea bridges technical implementation with privacy considerations, which matches the workshop's interdisciplinary focus. The only minor reason it's not a perfect 10 is that it doesn't explicitly address regulatory aspects (like GDPR) mentioned in the task description, though the privacy guarantees it aims to provide would likely help with regulatory compliance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly defines the problem (privacy risks in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive data), proposes a specific solution (applying DP to PEFT methods only), and outlines the evaluation approach (theoretical analysis and empirical studies). The technical concepts are well-articulated and the expected outcomes are specified. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as the specific privacy-utility trade-off metrics to be used, the exact noise calibration techniques to be employed, and more details on the theoretical analysis approach. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining two existing approaches (differential privacy and parameter-efficient fine-tuning) in a way that hasn't been thoroughly explored. While both DP and PEFT methods like LoRA are established techniques individually, their targeted integration specifically for privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning represents a fresh approach. The novelty lies in the focused application of DP to only the trainable PEFT parameters rather than the entire model. However, it builds upon existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new privacy-preserving techniques, which is why it doesn't receive a higher novelty score. Similar approaches may have been explored in limited contexts, though not comprehensively for LLMs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Both differential privacy and parameter-efficient fine-tuning are well-established techniques with existing implementations. The computational resources required would be reasonable since the approach specifically targets reducing computational overhead by applying DP only to a small subset of parameters. The evaluation methods (membership inference attacks, task performance metrics) are standard in the field. The theoretical analysis of privacy guarantees for this specific application is also feasible given the existing DP literature. The only minor challenge might be in optimizing the noise calibration for the specific PEFT architectures to achieve the best privacy-utility trade-off."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in the deployment of LLMs on sensitive data, which is increasingly important as these models are adopted in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. If successful, it could enable more widespread adoption of LLMs in regulated industries by providing formal privacy guarantees with minimal performance degradation. The significance is enhanced by the potential computational efficiency gains compared to full-model DP approaches. However, it's not rated higher because the impact might be somewhat limited to specific fine-tuning scenarios rather than addressing broader privacy concerns in LLM pre-training or inference, and the approach builds on incremental improvements rather than transformative new privacy paradigms."
