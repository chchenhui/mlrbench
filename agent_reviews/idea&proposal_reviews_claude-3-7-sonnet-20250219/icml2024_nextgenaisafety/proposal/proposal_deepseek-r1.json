    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Dangerous Capabilities' challenge identified in the task description by developing a system to prevent misuse while allowing beneficial research. The two-stage Risk-Adaptive Filter described in the proposal perfectly matches the main idea outlined in the research idea section. The proposal also effectively incorporates concepts from the literature review, particularly leveraging RLHF approaches mentioned in Safe RLHF (Dai et al., 2023) and RA-PbRL (Zhao et al., 2024), and addresses the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness identified as a key challenge. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions transparency concerns with DeepSeek, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed how DRAF improves transparency in its decision-making process."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for the risk classification model, focal loss function, and RLHF optimization. The three-tiered policy enforcement mechanism (low/medium/high risk) is clearly defined with concrete examples of how responses would be modified. The evaluation metrics are specific and measurable. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for updating the risk thresholds τ_low and τ_high could be more precisely defined, (2) the process for integrating new threat patterns could be elaborated further, and (3) more details on how the human feedback dataset will be collected and annotated would strengthen the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in several aspects. The dynamic risk-adaptive filtering approach that combines continuous risk scoring with tiered response policies represents a fresh perspective compared to binary allow/block systems. The integration of adversarial training specifically for dangerous capability queries and the use of safe-completion templates for medium-risk queries are innovative elements. The proposal also introduces a novel application of RLHF for dynamically adjusting risk thresholds. However, many of the core components build upon existing techniques (transformer-based classification, focal loss, PPO for RLHF) rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. The approach is more of a novel combination and application of existing techniques to the specific problem of dangerous capability filtering rather than a groundbreaking new methodology."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The risk classification approach using transformer models and focal loss is appropriate for handling class imbalance in safety-critical applications. The mathematical formulations for the classifier, loss function, and RLHF optimization are correctly presented. The three-tiered policy enforcement strategy is well-reasoned, and the evaluation metrics are appropriate for measuring both safety (FNR) and utility (user satisfaction). The inclusion of adversarial training enhances robustness. The experimental design with comparison to baselines and statistical validation is methodologically sound. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential failure modes and mitigations, (2) the reward function decomposition into safety and helpfulness components needs more justification for how these potentially competing objectives will be balanced, and (3) more rigorous theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the RLHF approach would enhance soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation steps. The two-stage architecture is modular and can be built using existing technologies and frameworks. The data collection strategy for the threat taxonomy and user simulation is practical. The transformer-based classification and RLHF components have been successfully implemented in similar contexts. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) creating a comprehensive dataset of dangerous-capability queries that covers all potential threat vectors will be difficult and potentially risky, (2) obtaining high-quality human feedback for RLHF, especially for sensitive topics, presents ethical and practical challenges, (3) the computational resources required for adversarial training and RLHF may be substantial, and (4) the continuous updating of the system against emerging threats will require significant ongoing effort. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present implementation hurdles that would need to be carefully managed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI safety with potentially high impact. As AI systems become more capable, preventing misuse while enabling beneficial applications is increasingly important. The expected outcomes of reducing false negatives on high-risk queries by 20% compared to baselines and reducing over-blocking by 30% would represent meaningful improvements in both safety and utility. The framework could influence how AI systems handle sensitive information across multiple domains (biosecurity, cybersecurity, etc.) and inform regulatory standards. The modular design allows for adaptation to different contexts and risk profiles. The societal impact of minimizing misuse risks without stifling innovation is significant, especially as AI systems become more widely deployed. However, the proposal's impact might be somewhat limited by its focus on text-based queries rather than addressing multimodal dangerous capabilities, and its effectiveness will depend on how well it generalizes to real-world queries beyond the training distribution."
