    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Dangerous Capabilities' challenge identified in the task description by developing a dynamic filtering system to prevent AI systems from revealing harmful information while preserving legitimate research access. The two-stage Risk-Adaptive Filter implementation follows exactly what was outlined in the research idea, with detailed elaboration on the risk classifier and policy engine. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, particularly Safe RLHF (Dai et al., 2023), risk-aware reinforcement learning (Zhao et al., 2024), and CVaR constraints (Chen et al., 2023). The threat taxonomy, methodology, and evaluation metrics are all consistent with addressing the balance between safety and utility mentioned in both the task description and research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate technical detail. The mathematical formulations for the risk classifier, policy engine, and optimization objectives are precisely defined with proper notation. The pseudocode for the filtering pipeline provides a clear implementation overview. The experimental design, including baselines, metrics, and ablation studies, is thoroughly described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact process for generating the 'SafeTemplate' responses could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical terms (e.g., PPO, entropy regularization) are mentioned without explanation, and (3) the relationship between the risk score thresholds (0.3, 0.7) and the policy actions could be more clearly connected to the stochastic policy formulation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to dangerous capability filtering. The two-stage architecture combining a continuous risk classifier with a dynamic policy engine represents a fresh perspective compared to traditional keyword-based or binary classification approaches. The integration of CVaR constraints into the RLHF framework for safety-critical applications is innovative, as is the three-tiered response strategy (Allow, SafeComplete, Refuse) that provides more nuanced options than binary allow/block decisions. The adversarial augmentation methodology for training data enhancement is also well-conceived. However, many of the individual components (RLHF, risk classification, CVaR) are drawn directly from existing literature rather than being novel contributions. The proposal's innovation lies primarily in the specific combination and application of these techniques to the dangerous capability filtering problem, rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for the risk classifier, policy optimization, and CVaR constraints are correctly presented and well-justified. The training methodology, including the combined MSE and ranking loss for the classifier, is appropriate for the task. The constrained optimization approach using Lagrangian methods is theoretically sound for balancing rewards and costs. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes strategies to address them, such as adversarial augmentation and periodic retraining. One minor weakness is that while the proposal mentions domain experts for data annotation, it doesn't fully address potential subjectivity or disagreement in risk labeling. Additionally, while the CVaR formulation is mathematically correct, the practical implementation details for approximating and optimizing this objective could be more thoroughly explained."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation requirements. The computational resources specified (8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) are substantial but reasonable for the scale of the project. The data collection and annotation process, while labor-intensive, is achievable with the described expert team. The fine-tuning of pre-trained models rather than training from scratch increases feasibility. However, several practical challenges may affect implementation: (1) creating a comprehensive dataset of 10,000+ expert-labeled queries across multiple dangerous domains will require significant effort and domain expertise; (2) the weekly retraining cycle may be ambitious given the computational requirements; (3) obtaining high-quality human feedback for RLHF, especially for dangerous queries, presents ethical and practical challenges; and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address how to handle ambiguous cases where domain experts might disagree on risk levels. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and methods, though it would require considerable resources and careful execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety with substantial real-world implications. As language models become more capable, preventing them from revealing dangerous information while maintaining their utility for legitimate research is increasingly important. The proposed Risk-Adaptive Filter could significantly improve over current static blocking approaches by reducing both false positives (overblocking) and false negatives (dangerous disclosures). The expected outcomes—FNR < 1% and FPR < 5%—would represent meaningful improvements in safety without substantially compromising utility. The approach could be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains like biosecurity and cybersecurity. Beyond the immediate application, the framework could inform broader AI safety practices and policy guidelines. The long-term vision of extending to multimodal risk scoring and user-level customization further enhances the potential impact. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on text-only queries and the specific application to dangerous capability filtering, rather than addressing the full spectrum of AI safety challenges, but within its scope, the potential impact is substantial."
