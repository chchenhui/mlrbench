        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, which specifically calls for 'theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks in SSL' and emphasizes the need to bridge theory and practice in self-supervised learning. The proposal directly addresses the gap identified in the task description: 'Existing research on self-supervised learning (SSL) has primarily concentrated on enhancing empirical performance without substantial theoretical underpinnings.' The idea provides a theoretical framework based on information disentanglement to explain why certain auxiliary tasks yield good representations, which is one of the key questions mentioned in the task description. The proposal also includes empirical validation through benchmarks, addressing the task's goal of connecting theory with practice."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (heuristic design of SSL tasks without theoretical understanding), proposes a solution (information disentanglement framework), and outlines an approach to validate the solution (deriving novel loss functions and evaluating them against existing methods). The core principle of separating 'invariant' from 'variant' information is explained concisely. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how exactly the mutual information objectives will be implemented in practice, what specific novel loss functions might look like, and what 'nuisance variables' entail in different contexts. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea offers a fresh theoretical perspective on SSL by formalizing the design of auxiliary tasks through information disentanglement principles. While mutual information has been used in SSL before, the specific framing of simultaneously maximizing mutual information between different views while minimizing mutual information with view-specific nuisance variables presents a novel theoretical lens. The approach moves beyond heuristic design to principled derivation of tasks, which is innovative. However, information-theoretic approaches to representation learning are not entirely new, and some aspects of the proposal build upon existing concepts in the field. The novelty lies more in the systematic application of these principles to derive and explain SSL tasks rather than in introducing completely new technical concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents some implementation challenges. Information-theoretic objectives, particularly mutual information estimation in high-dimensional spaces, can be computationally difficult to optimize directly. The proposal will likely require approximations or bounds on mutual information, which might introduce additional complexity. The evaluation plan is practical, leveraging existing benchmarks for comparison. The researchers would need strong expertise in both theoretical aspects of information theory and practical implementation of SSL methods. While challenging, similar approaches have been successfully implemented in related contexts, suggesting this research is achievable with appropriate resources and expertise. The proposal would benefit from more details on how to overcome known challenges in mutual information estimation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental gap in SSL research - the lack of theoretical understanding behind empirically successful methods. If successful, it would provide a principled framework for designing auxiliary tasks tailored to specific data types or downstream requirements, potentially advancing the field beyond current heuristic approaches. The impact could be substantial across multiple domains where SSL is applied (vision, language, speech, etc.). The work could lead to more efficient, robust, and fair representations, addressing several key challenges mentioned in the task description. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of SSL in developing foundation models, where even marginal improvements in representation quality can have outsized impacts when scaled."
