        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the theoretical foundations of SSL, which is a primary focus of the workshop. The proposal specifically targets the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding by developing an information-theoretic framework to analyze why certain auxiliary tasks perform better than others. It also addresses sample complexity, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The cross-modal validation approach (vision, language, graphs) matches the workshop's interest in SSL across various domains. The idea's focus on quantifying task utility and providing theoretical guarantees directly responds to the workshop's call for theory-driven design of auxiliary tasks and comparative analysis of different auxiliary tasks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (heuristic selection of SSL tasks), the proposed solution (information-theoretic framework), the methodology (using mutual information to measure task utility), and expected outcomes. The connection between task utility and sample complexity is well-explained. The only minor ambiguities are in the specifics of how the MI-based bounds would be formulated and how exactly the cross-modal experiments would be structured to validate the theoretical framework. While these details would naturally be expanded in a full proposal, a slightly more concrete description of the mathematical approach or experimental design would have earned a perfect score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to systematizing SSL task selection through information theory. While information theory has been applied to representation learning before, the specific focus on quantifying auxiliary task utility and linking it directly to sample complexity represents a fresh perspective. The cross-domain validation approach is also innovative. However, the use of mutual information as a measure in representation learning is not entirely new, and similar theoretical frameworks have been proposed for other aspects of deep learning. The idea builds upon existing information-theoretic concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new theoretical constructs, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea is satisfactory but faces some challenges. Computing mutual information in high-dimensional spaces is notoriously difficult and often requires approximations that may affect the theoretical guarantees. The proposal to validate across multiple modalities (vision, language, graphs) is ambitious and would require significant computational resources and expertise across domains. While the theoretical framework development is feasible, empirically validating the theoretical bounds might be challenging due to the complexity of modern SSL architectures. The idea would likely require considerable refinement of the information-theoretic estimators to make them practical for complex neural networks, which is why it receives a moderate feasibility score."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in SSL research - the lack of theoretical understanding behind empirically successful methods. If successful, it would provide a principled approach to designing auxiliary tasks, potentially eliminating much of the current trial-and-error process. The ability to predict sample complexity requirements would be extremely valuable for practitioners, especially when working with limited data. The cross-modal validation would make the findings broadly applicable across domains. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications, as it could significantly reduce computational resources needed for SSL by enabling more efficient task design. This addresses a fundamental challenge in the field and could lead to more efficient and effective SSL methods across domains."
