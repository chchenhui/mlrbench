    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap identified in the task description regarding the lack of theoretical foundations for SSL methods by developing an information-theoretic framework for principled auxiliary task design. The proposal follows through on the core idea of information disentanglement between invariant and variant information across views, formalizing this using mutual information objectives as outlined in the research idea. The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations that are consistent with the information-theoretic approaches mentioned in the literature review, particularly drawing from papers on mutual information estimation and disentanglement. The proposal also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as balancing mutual information objectives and evaluating representation quality."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented with precise mathematical formulations. The algorithmic framework is laid out step-by-step, making implementation straightforward. The experimental design section comprehensively covers datasets, architectures, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for sampling or approximating nuisance variables in step 4 of Algorithm 1 could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the theoretical guarantees mentioned in Expected Outcomes and the proposed methodology could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some of the mathematical notation (e.g., the exact definition of sg() in the non-contrastive loss) is not fully explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining information-theoretic principles with self-supervised learning in a comprehensive framework. The key innovation lies in the explicit formulation of SSL as a mutual information game that simultaneously maximizes shared information while minimizing view-specific nuisances. While individual components like InfoNCE and MINE-style estimators have been used in prior work (as noted in the literature review), their integration into a unified disentanglement framework for SSL task design is novel. The proposal also introduces new contrastive and non-contrastive losses derived from this formulation. However, the approach shares similarities with existing work on disentangled representations and mutual information maximization mentioned in the literature review, particularly papers 1, 3, and 10, which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates strong theoretical foundations. The information-theoretic formulation is mathematically rigorous, with clear objectives and variational approximations for the otherwise intractable mutual information terms. The methodology leverages established techniques (InfoNCE, MINE) with appropriate justifications. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering multiple modalities, architectures, and evaluation metrics, with proper statistical validation through multiple runs and significance testing. The ablation studies are well-designed to test key aspects of the framework. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions theoretical guarantees on invariance and disentanglement, it doesn't fully elaborate on the conditions under which these guarantees hold or provide detailed proofs, though it does mention 'mild conditions' like Lipschitz encoders and bounded critics."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The algorithmic framework is clearly defined and builds upon established techniques like InfoNCE and MINE. The experimental setup uses standard datasets and architectures that are widely available. However, there are aspects that may require considerable effort: (1) The adversarial estimation of mutual information between representations and nuisance variables could be unstable and require careful tuning, (2) The proposal doesn't fully address how to identify or model the nuisance variables in practice for complex real-world data, (3) The computational cost of training critics alongside encoders could be substantial, especially for large-scale experiments on ImageNet. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do introduce some uncertainty about the ease of implementation and the stability of the training process."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in self-supervised learning: the lack of principled theoretical foundations for designing auxiliary tasks. If successful, it would provide significant contributions to both theory and practice. Theoretically, it would offer a unifying framework that explains why certain SSL methods work, potentially resolving long-standing questions in the field. Practically, the expected outcomes include substantial improvements in accuracy (2-5%), robustness (10-15%), and fairness (20-30% reduction in demographic parity gap), which would be highly impactful. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications in domains with stringent requirements like healthcare and autonomous driving. The proposal also has the potential to reduce computational costs by making SSL more efficient, addressing an important concern in modern AI development. The significance is somewhat limited only by the fact that the field is rapidly evolving, and competing approaches may emerge during the research period."

It combines rigorous information-theoretic principles with practical implementation strategies and comprehensive evaluation plans. The work has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of why certain auxiliary tasks work better than others and provide a principled framework for designing new tasks tailored to specific requirements.
