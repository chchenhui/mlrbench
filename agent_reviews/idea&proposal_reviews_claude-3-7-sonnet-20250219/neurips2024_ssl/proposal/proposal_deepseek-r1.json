        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging theory and practice in SSL by developing a principled framework for auxiliary task design based on information disentanglement. The proposal incorporates the core concepts from the research idea (separating invariant from variant information using mutual information objectives) and expands them into a comprehensive research plan. It also builds upon the literature review, particularly drawing from papers on disentangled representations, mutual information estimation, and information-theoretic approaches to SSL. The methodology section clearly demonstrates how the theoretical framework will be instantiated and validated, which aligns with the workshop's interest in both theoretical foundations and empirical applications of SSL."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined, and the theoretical framework is presented with appropriate mathematical formalism. The methodology section provides concrete details on how the framework will be implemented, including specific algorithms and evaluation metrics. The proposal effectively communicates complex information-theoretic concepts and their application to SSL. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact procedure for generating views with known nuisances could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the proposed approach and existing methods like SimCLR could be more explicitly compared, and (3) some technical details about the variational upper bound implementation could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel theoretical framework that formalizes the design of auxiliary tasks in SSL through the lens of information disentanglement. While individual components (mutual information maximization, contrastive learning) have been explored in prior work, the integration of these concepts into a unified framework for principled auxiliary task design represents a significant innovation. The proposal's approach to explicitly modeling and minimizing the mutual information with nuisance variables, while simultaneously maximizing shared information across views, offers a fresh perspective on SSL. The derived auxiliary tasks, particularly the 'Disentangled Contrastive Learning' and 'Multi-Modal Disentanglement,' demonstrate original applications of the framework. The proposal builds upon existing literature but extends it in meaningful ways, offering a more principled approach to what has largely been a heuristic-driven field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on solid information-theoretic foundations and presents a mathematically coherent framework. The use of mutual information as a measure for capturing invariant information while discarding variants is theoretically justified. The approximation methods for the intractable mutual information terms (InfoNCE for the invariance term and variational bounds for the disentanglement term) are well-established in the literature. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address the challenges of estimating mutual information in high-dimensional spaces, which can be notoriously difficult, (2) the assumption that nuisance variables can be explicitly modeled may not hold in all practical scenarios, and (3) the trade-off parameter Î» between invariance and disentanglement objectives may require careful tuning with limited theoretical guidance. While the overall approach is sound, these aspects could benefit from more rigorous justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps for implementation and evaluation. The methodology leverages existing techniques (e.g., InfoNCE, variational bounds) and infrastructure (standard datasets, encoder architectures) that are readily available. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive, covering multiple data modalities and evaluation metrics. However, several practical challenges may affect feasibility: (1) the computational resources required for training on large datasets like ImageNet may be substantial, (2) designing augmentations with known nuisances for complex data types (e.g., graphs, time-series) could be difficult, (3) the optimization of both the encoder network and the nuisance predictor simultaneously might lead to training instabilities, and (4) the proposed evaluation metrics (particularly disentanglement metrics like MIG and SAP) can be challenging to compute reliably. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do introduce implementation complexities that will require careful handling."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental gap in SSL research: the lack of principled design for auxiliary tasks. By providing a theoretical framework that explains why certain auxiliary tasks yield effective representations, the research has the potential to significantly advance both the theory and practice of SSL. The impact would be far-reaching across multiple domains: (1) it would enable more systematic design of SSL methods tailored to specific data types or downstream requirements, (2) it would improve the interpretability of learned representations by explicitly modeling what information they should capture or discard, (3) it would provide a unifying theoretical lens through which to understand diverse SSL approaches, and (4) it could lead to more robust and efficient representations, particularly in domains with limited labeled data or distribution shifts. The proposal directly addresses key challenges identified in the literature review and has the potential to influence how researchers approach SSL task design in the future."
