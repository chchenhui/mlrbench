        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging theory and practice in SSL by developing a principled framework for auxiliary task design based on information disentanglement. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, particularly drawing on papers [3], [5], [6], and [10] regarding mutual information estimation and disentanglement. It clearly responds to the identified challenges, especially the theoretical understanding of auxiliary tasks and effective disentanglement of representations. The methodology is comprehensive and well-structured, covering theoretical formulation, algorithmic implementation, and empirical validation, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of fostering dialogue between theory and practice."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated and structured in a logical, easy-to-follow manner. The introduction clearly establishes the background, problem statement, and proposed solution. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the theoretical framework, estimation techniques, and experimental design. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly the information disentanglement objective and MI estimation approaches. The only minor issues preventing a perfect score are: (1) some sections could benefit from more concrete examples of how the nuisance variables Vi would be defined for specific augmentations, and (2) the relationship between the theoretical framework and the derived loss functions could be made slightly more explicit to ensure complete clarity on how theory translates to practice."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by formalizing a comprehensive framework for SSL based on information disentanglement principles. While individual components draw from existing work (mutual information maximization in contrastive learning, disentanglement via MI minimization), the integration of these concepts into a unified framework specifically for SSL auxiliary task design is novel. The explicit formulation of nuisance variables Vi representing augmentation parameters and the joint optimization of I(Z1;Z2) and I(Zi;Vi) provides a fresh perspective. However, the approach shares similarities with some existing methods mentioned in the literature review (particularly papers [3], [6], and [10]), which prevents it from being considered groundbreaking. The novelty lies more in the systematic application and formalization rather than introducing entirely new concepts."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. The information-theoretic framework is mathematically well-formulated, with clear objectives and constraints. The approach to estimating mutual information is grounded in established methods (InfoNCE, CLUB), and the derivation of concrete loss functions from the theoretical principles is sound. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics. The connection between theory and practice is well-established. The only aspects preventing a perfect score are: (1) potential challenges in accurately estimating I(Zi;Vi) that could affect the practical implementation, and (2) some assumptions about the nature of invariant vs. variant information that might not hold in all data distributions. Nevertheless, the proposal acknowledges these challenges and provides reasonable approaches to address them."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The core components—contrastive learning frameworks, MI estimators, and standard vision architectures—are well-established. The datasets and evaluation protocols are standard in the field. However, several aspects increase implementation complexity: (1) accurately defining and accessing augmentation parameters Vi during training requires careful engineering; (2) training auxiliary networks for MI estimation adds computational overhead; (3) balancing the two competing objectives (maximizing I(Z1;Z2) while minimizing I(Zi;Vi)) may require extensive hyperparameter tuning to find optimal α and β values; and (4) the comprehensive evaluation plan (including robustness testing and disentanglement quantification) is ambitious and resource-intensive. While these challenges are manageable, they will require significant effort and computational resources to implement successfully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important gap in SSL research—the lack of principled theoretical frameworks for auxiliary task design. If successful, this work could significantly impact the field by: (1) providing a systematic methodology for designing SSL tasks tailored to specific requirements; (2) enhancing our understanding of why certain SSL methods work better than others; (3) potentially improving representation robustness and transferability through explicit disentanglement; and (4) establishing stronger connections between information theory and practical SSL algorithms. The approach directly responds to the workshop's call for bridging theory and practice. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of SSL in developing foundation models. While the initial focus on vision may limit immediate broader impact, the framework has clear potential for extension to other modalities, and the theoretical insights could influence SSL research across domains."
