    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of efficient long-text instruction following, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description under 'Applications' and 'Modeling' topics. The proposal faithfully expands on the main idea of Dynamic Context Windows (DCW) for adaptively adjusting attention based on instruction relevance, maintaining the core two-phase architecture described in the idea. The methodology section thoroughly incorporates concepts from the literature review, particularly building upon work like Core Context Aware Attention, Longformer, and adaptive attention mechanisms. The mathematical formulations for relevance classification and attention allocation are well-grounded in the transformer literature cited. The only minor inconsistency is that the conclusion includes an emoji, which seems out of place in a formal research proposal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes and conclusion. The research problem and proposed solution are clearly defined, with the two-phase DCW architecture explained in detail. The mathematical formulations in the methodology section are precise and well-presented, making the technical approach understandable. The relevance classification mechanism and dual-attention mechanism are explained with appropriate equations and definitions. The synthetic data generation and evaluation approaches are also clearly outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the lightweight classifier could be more specific, (2) the transition between the classifier and the enhanced processor layer could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some technical terms like 'FLOPs' are used without definition, which might be unclear to some readers."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to long-text processing through the Dynamic Context Windows framework. The innovation lies in combining relevance classification with adaptive attention allocation in a two-phase architecture specifically designed for instruction-following tasks. This represents a meaningful advancement over existing approaches like Longformer and Core Context Aware Attention by making the attention mechanism instruction-aware and dynamically adaptive. The dual-attention mechanism with its mathematical formulation for creating core and background segments is an original contribution. However, the approach does build significantly on existing sparse attention mechanisms and hierarchical processing frameworks mentioned in the literature review. While the proposal integrates these concepts in a new way for instruction-following, it is more of an innovative combination and extension of existing techniques rather than a fundamentally new paradigm. The synthetic data generation approach, while practical, also follows established patterns in the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the relevance classification function Î±(i) and the dual-attention mechanism A_dcw are well-defined and theoretically sound. The approach builds logically on established transformer architectures and attention mechanisms from the literature. The masking matrix M is particularly well-formulated to enforce the DCW structure with appropriate attention patterns between core and background segments. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, covering both effectiveness and efficiency metrics with appropriate benchmarks. The synthetic data generation approach is well-justified for the specific requirements of training the model. The only minor weaknesses in soundness are: (1) limited discussion of potential failure modes or edge cases where the approach might not work well, (2) no explicit analysis of how the approach handles very long sequences beyond current context windows, and (3) limited theoretical analysis of the computational complexity reduction compared to standard attention mechanisms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach that could be implemented with current technology and methods. The two-phase architecture builds on established transformer models and attention mechanisms, making it technically implementable. The synthetic data generation approach is practical and achievable using existing resources like legal texts and scientific literature. The evaluation framework using established benchmarks is also realistic. However, there are several feasibility challenges: (1) training the lightweight classifier to accurately identify relevant segments across diverse domains may require substantial data and fine-tuning, (2) the computational overhead of the initial classification phase might partially offset the efficiency gains in the second phase, (3) the proposal doesn't address potential challenges in hyperparameter tuning for the dynamic masking matrix, and (4) the integration of this approach with existing pre-trained models isn't fully specified. While these challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, they do represent significant implementation hurdles that would require careful engineering and potentially additional resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical limitation in current LLMs - efficient processing of long texts while maintaining instruction relevance. This has significant implications for numerous applications mentioned in the proposal, including legal document analysis, medical literature review, and technical documentation processing. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in knowledge-intensive fields. If successful, the DCW approach could substantially reduce computational costs while improving performance on long-text tasks, making advanced language AI more accessible in resource-constrained environments. The work also contributes methodologically to the field through its novel combination of relevance classification and structured sparse attention. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's alignment with current research trends in efficient transformer architectures and instruction tuning. However, the proposal's impact might be somewhat limited by its focus on a specific aspect of LLM functionality (long-text processing) rather than addressing broader limitations like reasoning capabilities or factuality."
