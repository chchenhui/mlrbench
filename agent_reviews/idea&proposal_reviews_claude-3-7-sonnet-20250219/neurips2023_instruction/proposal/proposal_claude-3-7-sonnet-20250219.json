    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of instruction following in long-context scenarios, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description under 'Applications: long-context, multi-round and personalized instruction-following models.' The proposal faithfully expands on the core idea of Dynamic Context Windows (DCW) that adaptively adjusts attention based on instruction relevance, maintaining the hierarchical importance zones concept. The methodology thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, building upon works like Longformer's sparse attention patterns, LongLoRA's efficient fine-tuning approach, and addressing the key challenges identified regarding computational complexity and attention mechanism limitations. The proposal's focus on both effectiveness and efficiency metrics also aligns perfectly with the evaluation criteria mentioned in the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for the relevance assessment and hierarchical attention mechanism. The diagrams and equations help illustrate complex concepts effectively. The training methodology, data collection strategy, and evaluation metrics are all comprehensively defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact implementation details of the sparse attention patterns S(t_i, t_j) could be more precisely defined; (2) The relationship between the relevance assessment module and the base LLM architecture could be more explicitly described; and (3) Some of the hyperparameters (p, q, r for importance tiers) lack specific recommended values or tuning strategies."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to handling long contexts in LLMs through instruction-driven attention allocation. The key innovation lies in the dynamic, instruction-aware segmentation of documents into importance tiers with corresponding attention patterns. While individual components draw from existing techniques (such as sparse attention in Longformer and LoRA fine-tuning from LongLoRA), their combination and adaptation for instruction-specific relevance is original. The hierarchical attention mechanism that differentially allocates computational resources based on chunk relevance represents a fresh perspective. However, the approach shares conceptual similarities with adaptive attention span methods and some aspects of Core Context Aware Attention mentioned in the literature review. The relevance assessment module, while innovative in its application, builds on established dual-encoder architectures rather than introducing fundamentally new architectural elements."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The mathematical formulations for the relevance assessment and hierarchical attention mechanism are well-defined and theoretically sound. The multi-stage training methodology is comprehensive and addresses potential challenges in training such a system. The evaluation framework is robust, covering both effectiveness and efficiency metrics with appropriate baselines and ablation studies. The approach is grounded in established techniques from the literature while extending them in principled ways. The loss function design incorporating both task performance and relevance guidance is particularly well-conceived. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional theoretical analysis: (1) The theoretical guarantees on information preservation when using sparse attention patterns across tiers; (2) More rigorous analysis of the computational complexity reduction compared to full attention; and (3) Potential limitations in the relevance assessment module's ability to identify truly relevant content without seeing the full document context."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach that builds upon established techniques and architectures. The use of LoRA-based fine-tuning reduces computational requirements compared to full model retraining, making implementation more practical. The multi-stage training approach is sensible and addresses potential challenges in developing the relevance assessment module. The data collection strategy is comprehensive and realistic. However, several implementation challenges may affect feasibility: (1) Creating high-quality relevance annotations for training data could be labor-intensive and subjective; (2) The computational overhead of the relevance assessment module might partially offset efficiency gains from sparse attention; (3) Balancing the trade-off between performance and efficiency when determining importance tiers could require extensive hyperparameter tuning; and (4) Implementing the hierarchical attention mechanism efficiently within existing transformer architectures might require significant engineering effort. While these challenges are substantial, they don't render the approach impractical, but rather indicate areas requiring careful implementation consideration."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research addresses a critical limitation in current LLM capabilities - efficient processing of long documents with instruction-specific focus. If successful, this work could have substantial impact across multiple domains requiring long-document understanding, including legal analysis, academic research, healthcare, and business intelligence. The approach offers a more computationally efficient alternative to simply scaling up context windows, which aligns with growing concerns about AI sustainability. The expected technical outcomes (15-25% performance improvement with 40-60% computational savings) would represent a significant advancement in the field. The broader impacts identified, including democratizing advanced NLP capabilities and enabling new application domains, are compelling and well-justified. The proposal also opens several promising future research directions, particularly in multimodal extensions and personalized context prioritization. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on a specific technical challenge rather than addressing broader issues like safety, bias, or factuality mentioned in the task description."
