        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on exploring XAI applications across diverse domains and identifying ways to transfer insights between use cases. The MetaXplain framework specifically tackles the challenge of domain-specific XAI methods requiring costly re-engineering, which was highlighted in both the idea and literature review as a key challenge. The proposal includes applications in healthcare, finance, and NLP, with plans to expand to environmental science and legal tech, matching the workshop's scope. The methodology section thoroughly details the meta-learning approach outlined in the research idea, and the evaluation metrics address the workshop's interest in understanding limitations and transferability of XAI methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows naturally from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined with specific, measurable goals. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations that are well-presented. The algorithmic steps are laid out in a step-by-step manner that is easy to follow. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are comprehensively described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact nature of the expert annotations needed for each domain could be more precisely defined, and (2) some technical details about how the explainer network handles different data modalities (images, text, tabular) could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by applying meta-learning techniques to the specific challenge of transferable XAI. While meta-learning itself is not new, and some papers in the literature review (e.g., 'Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Explainable AI') have explored similar concepts, this proposal offers a fresh perspective by developing a comprehensive framework with a multi-head architecture specifically designed to work across heterogeneous domains. The bi-level optimization strategy adapted from MAML for explanation modules rather than just predictive models represents an innovative application. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on cross-domain transferability of explanations rather than just model performance. However, it builds upon existing techniques (MAML, gradient-based meta-learning) rather than introducing entirely new algorithmic approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The meta-learning framework is well-grounded in established methods like MAML, and the mathematical formulations for the bi-level optimization are correctly presented. The explainer network architecture is logically designed with appropriate components for different data types. The evaluation metrics include both quantitative measures (infidelity, sensitivity-n) and qualitative assessments (human interpretability), providing a comprehensive evaluation approach. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and statistical significance testing. The proposal acknowledges potential risks (over-generalization, computational cost) and offers mitigation strategies. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions the infidelity metric from Yeh et al., it could provide more detailed justification for why this particular metric is appropriate for cross-domain evaluation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with a reasonable timeline and clear milestones. The 12-month timeline allows sufficient time for data collection, implementation, experimentation, and analysis. The computational requirements, while substantial for meta-training, are within the capabilities of modern research infrastructure. The data collection strategy across multiple domains is ambitious but achievable, especially given the focus on few-shot learning (requiring only 5-10 annotations per task). The technical approach builds on established meta-learning methods, reducing implementation risk. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) obtaining high-quality expert annotations across diverse domains may be challenging and time-consuming, (2) designing a universal explainer that works effectively across heterogeneous data types (images, text, tabular) presents significant engineering challenges, and (3) the computational cost of meta-training across multiple domains could be substantial, though the proposal does acknowledge this and suggests first-order MAML approximations as a mitigation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in XAI research with substantial potential impact. By developing a meta-learning framework for transferable explanations, it could significantly reduce the barrier to entry for deploying XAI in new domains—a key challenge identified in the literature review. The expected outcomes (5× faster adaptation, reduced annotation burden) would provide tangible benefits to organizations implementing AI systems across various sectors. The proposal explicitly connects to broader impacts including cross-industry deployment, standardization of XAI approaches to ease regulatory compliance, and advancing research in joint optimization of performance and interpretability. The work aligns well with growing regulatory requirements for AI transparency (e.g., GDPR's 'right to explanation'). While the immediate impact would be primarily in research and development settings, successful implementation could eventually lead to wider adoption of transparent AI systems in critical domains like healthcare, finance, and legal tech."
