        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly aligned with the task description. It focuses on applying XAI methods (specifically SHAP and LIME) in healthcare, which is explicitly mentioned as one of the target areas in the workshop. The idea addresses the application of XAI in a specific domain (healthcare), discusses potential impacts, and identifies obstacles (lack of trust, transparency). It also considers methodological requirements for applying XAI in healthcare through its proposed user testing and iterative refinement approach. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly discuss how insights from healthcare XAI might transfer to other domains, though it does mention developing a framework that could be applied elsewhere."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (lack of transparency in healthcare AI), proposes a specific solution (applying SHAP and LIME for explainability), outlines a methodological approach (5 clear steps), and describes expected outcomes. The proposal is easy to understand and leaves little room for ambiguity. However, it could be slightly improved by providing more specific details about how the explanations would be tailored for different stakeholders (patients vs. healthcare providers) and what specific healthcare tasks would be prioritized in the research."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing XAI techniques (SHAP and LIME) with healthcare applications, which is not entirely new. Many researchers are already working on applying XAI in healthcare settings. The approach of testing explanations with both healthcare providers and patients adds some originality, as does the focus on patient trust as a key outcome. However, the core techniques being used are established, and the application domain is one where XAI is already being actively explored. The proposal doesn't introduce fundamentally new XAI methods or radically new approaches to healthcare AI explainability."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. SHAP and LIME are established XAI techniques with available implementations. Medical datasets for training and testing are accessible (though privacy concerns will need to be addressed). The user testing methodology is straightforward and commonly used in human-computer interaction research. The iterative refinement approach is practical and allows for adjustments based on feedback. The main challenges would be in ensuring that the explanations are truly understandable to patients with varying levels of medical knowledge, and in measuring the impact on trust and adherence, but these are manageable challenges rather than fundamental barriers."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a critical issue in healthcare AI adoption. Trust is essential in healthcare, and the lack of explainability in AI systems is a significant barrier to their acceptance and effective use. Improving patient trust and adherence to AI-driven treatments could have substantial real-world impact on health outcomes. The potential to reduce misdiagnosis and treatment errors has life-saving implications. The research could also influence regulatory guidelines for AI in healthcare, which would have broad systemic impact. While the approach is not revolutionary, the application area is one where even incremental improvements in explainability could yield significant benefits for patient care and health system efficiency."
