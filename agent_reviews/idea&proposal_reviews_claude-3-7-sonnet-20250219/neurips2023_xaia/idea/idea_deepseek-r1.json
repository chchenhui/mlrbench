        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of exploring 'whether insights gained from one use case can be transferred to other use cases' by proposing a systematic evaluation of XAI method transferability across domains. The idea also touches on several other key workshop topics, including identifying obstacles in XAI applications, exploring methodological requirements, and understanding limitations of XAI. The proposal specifically mentions transferring insights between healthcare and legal domains, which are explicitly mentioned in the workshop description. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't extensively discuss past applications of XAI, focusing more on present and future applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (siloed XAI methods), proposes a specific approach (systematic evaluation of transferability), outlines methodologies (case studies, hybrid benchmarks), and describes expected outcomes (taxonomy, guidelines, tools). The proposal is concise yet comprehensive, covering motivation, methodology, and potential impact. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific metrics for measuring 'explanation fidelity' and more details on how the 'novel framework' would be constructed. The concept of 'transferable components' is introduced but could be more precisely defined with examples beyond the brief mention of feature attribution techniques."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by addressing a gap in current XAI research - the cross-domain transferability of methods. While individual XAI methods exist for specific domains, the systematic evaluation of their transferability and the development of a framework specifically for cross-domain adaptation represents a fresh approach. The proposal to create a taxonomy of transferable XAI elements is particularly innovative. The research doesn't claim to invent entirely new XAI techniques, but rather proposes a novel way to understand, evaluate, and leverage existing methods across domains - a meta-level innovation that could significantly impact how XAI research progresses. The hybrid benchmarking approach combining synthetic and real-world datasets also adds to its novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The proposal builds on existing XAI methods and domains, which provides a solid foundation. Case studies between healthcare and legal NLP systems are practical and can leverage existing datasets and models. However, creating a comprehensive framework for cross-domain transferability is complex and ambitious. The evaluation metrics (explanation fidelity, user trust, task performance) would require careful operationalization. The development of hybrid benchmarks combining synthetic and real-world datasets would require significant expertise and resources. The scope might need to be narrowed initially to a few well-defined domains before expanding to others like climate science or education. Overall, the idea is implementable but would require substantial expertise, time, and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in XAI research with potentially far-reaching implications. If successful, it could fundamentally change how XAI methods are developed, evaluated, and deployed across domains. The potential benefits are substantial: reducing redundant research efforts, accelerating XAI adoption in new domains, establishing standardized evaluation frameworks, and addressing cross-cutting challenges like fairness and trust. The work could lead to more efficient resource allocation in XAI research and development while improving the quality and consistency of explanations across different applications. The impact would extend to multiple stakeholders, including researchers, developers, domain experts, end-users, and potentially regulators. The identification of transferable components versus domain-specific constraints would provide valuable insights for the entire XAI community."
