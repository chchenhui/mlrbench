        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The 'Federated Explainability' idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the application of XAI in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, which are specifically mentioned in the workshop scope. The proposal tackles the challenge of applying XAI methods in privacy-sensitive contexts, which addresses the 'obstacles that hinder progress' aspect of the workshop. The idea also explores 'methodological requirements for applying XAI' by proposing a framework for generating explanations in federated learning settings. The only minor limitation in alignment is that it doesn't explicitly discuss transferring insights between use cases, though it does touch on multiple domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and clearly defined. It precisely identifies the problem (privacy concerns in XAI for sensitive domains), proposes a specific solution (federated computation of explanation components), and outlines the expected outcomes (privacy-preserving XAI tools). The technical approach involving local computation and secure aggregation is well-explained. However, there could be more specificity about exactly how different types of explanations (SHAP, LIME, etc.) would be adapted to the federated setting, and what the concrete implementation challenges might be for each explanation type. The proposal could also benefit from more details on how the aggregated explanations would maintain fidelity to the underlying model decisions."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel intersection of two important areas: federated learning and explainable AI. While both fields have been extensively researched separately, their integration in this specific manner—creating a framework for generating explanations without sharing sensitive data—represents a fresh approach. The concept of 'Federated Explainability' appears to be innovative, addressing a gap in current research. The approach of computing explanation components locally and aggregating them securely offers a new perspective on privacy-preserving XAI. However, some elements of the proposal build upon existing techniques in federated learning and XAI rather than introducing completely new methods, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed research is feasible but faces moderate implementation challenges. The core technologies required—federated learning, secure aggregation, and XAI methods like SHAP and LIME—are well-established. However, adapting explanation methods to work in a federated setting without compromising explanation quality presents technical hurdles. Particularly challenging would be ensuring that locally computed explanation components can be meaningfully aggregated while preserving both privacy and explanation fidelity. The proposal doesn't fully address potential computational overhead or communication costs, which could be significant when generating complex explanations across distributed clients. Additionally, different explanation methods may require different adaptation strategies, adding to implementation complexity."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap at the intersection of privacy, trust, and AI transparency. As AI systems increasingly handle sensitive data in healthcare, finance, and other regulated domains, the ability to explain model decisions without compromising privacy is extremely valuable. The proposed framework could enable adoption of AI in sensitive areas where both explainability and privacy are non-negotiable requirements. The impact extends beyond technical advancement to potentially influencing regulatory compliance, ethical AI deployment, and user trust in AI systems. The work could establish new standards for responsible AI in privacy-sensitive contexts and open up applications of XAI in domains where data sharing is restricted by regulation or ethical considerations."
