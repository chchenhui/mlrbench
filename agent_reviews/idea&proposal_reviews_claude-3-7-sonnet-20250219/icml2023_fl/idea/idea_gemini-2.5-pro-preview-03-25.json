        "justification": "The FedPEFT idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on 'Training, fine-tuning, and personalizing (foundation) models in federated settings.' It directly addresses the challenge of deploying large foundation models in resource-constrained federated environments, which is a key topic of interest. The proposal also touches on scalability and robustness of federated systems, personalization aspects, and practical applications across heterogeneous devices - all explicitly mentioned in the task description. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address privacy beyond the inherent privacy benefits of federated learning, though privacy preservation is mentioned as a motivation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation clearly establishes the problem (size constraints of foundation models in FL settings), and the proposed solution (adapting PEFT techniques for federated learning) is well-articulated. The core components - using small PEFT modules instead of full models, adaptive allocation based on device capabilities, and novel aggregation strategies - are all clearly defined. The expected outcomes are also explicitly stated. The only minor ambiguities are in the specifics of how the adaptive PEFT module allocation would work and what exact aggregation strategies would be developed, but this level of detail is reasonable for a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining two existing approaches (PEFT techniques and federated learning) in a way that hasn't been thoroughly explored. While both PEFT methods (like LoRA and Adapters) and federated learning are established research areas, their integration specifically for foundation models on heterogeneous devices represents a fresh perspective. The adaptive allocation of PEFT modules based on device capabilities adds another layer of innovation. However, the core concept builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score. Some work on efficient federated fine-tuning exists, though not specifically focused on modern PEFT techniques for foundation models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current technology and methods. PEFT techniques are well-established and have proven effective for fine-tuning large models with limited resources. Federated learning frameworks are mature enough to implement the proposed approach. The communication efficiency gains from transmitting only small PEFT modules instead of full models are practically achievable. The main implementation challenges would be in developing effective aggregation strategies for the PEFT updates and creating the adaptive allocation system based on device capabilities. These challenges are substantial but solvable with existing techniques and reasonable research effort. The heterogeneity of devices presents complexity but is explicitly addressed in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in the field of federated learning - enabling the use of large foundation models on edge devices with limited resources. If successful, it could significantly expand the applicability of foundation models in privacy-sensitive domains where data cannot leave client devices. The communication efficiency gains could make federated learning practical for many more real-world applications. The impact would be felt across multiple domains including mobile applications, IoT, healthcare, and other areas where both privacy and model quality are important. The work could bridge an important gap between the capabilities of modern foundation models and the practical constraints of federated learning environments."
