        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'training, fine-tuning, and personalizing (foundation) models in federated settings' and 'scalable and robust federated machine learning systems.' The proposal builds upon the core idea of adapting Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques for federated learning settings, as outlined in the research idea. It thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing and building upon works like SLoRA, FeDeRA, FedP²EFT, and the original FedPEFT paper by Sun et al. The proposal acknowledges the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly addressing data heterogeneity, resource constraints, and efficient communication. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed framework will tackle these challenges through adaptive PEFT allocation and novel aggregation strategies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The introduction effectively establishes the background, problem statement, and research objectives. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the FedPEFT framework, including the overall protocol, adaptive PEFT configuration mechanisms, and novel aggregation strategies. The experimental design is comprehensive, outlining baselines, evaluation scenarios, and metrics. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further clarification, particularly the mathematical formulations of the proposed aggregation strategies (especially Strategy 2: Subspace Aggregation) and the exact mechanisms for adaptive PEFT configuration selection. Additionally, while the proposal mentions both rule-based and learning-based approaches for PEFT adaptation, the details of the learning-based approach are somewhat vague. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is logically structured and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing several novel components to the federated PEFT landscape. The key innovation lies in the adaptive allocation of PEFT configurations based on both system capabilities and data characteristics, which distinguishes it from existing approaches that typically use uniform PEFT configurations. The proposed aggregation strategies for heterogeneous PEFT updates (particularly the subspace aggregation and rank-stratified approaches) also represent novel contributions. However, the core concept of applying PEFT in federated settings has been explored in prior work (as acknowledged by the authors), including the original FedPEFT framework by Sun et al. and other approaches like SLoRA and FeDeRA. While the proposal builds significantly upon these works and introduces important innovations, it represents an evolution rather than a revolutionary approach. The proposal could have more clearly articulated how its specific technical contributions differ from or improve upon the aggregation methods in existing works like SLoRA or FeDeRA."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. It builds upon well-established techniques in both federated learning (FL) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), particularly focusing on LoRA as the primary PEFT method. The FedPEFT framework algorithm is well-defined, with clear steps for server broadcast, client-side adaptation and training, client upload, and server-side aggregation. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines, evaluation scenarios, and metrics that address both model utility and system efficiency. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and challenges, such as the complexity of aggregating heterogeneous PEFT updates. However, some technical aspects could benefit from more detailed justification, particularly the theoretical properties of the proposed aggregation strategies (e.g., convergence guarantees). Additionally, while the proposal mentions learning-based approaches for adaptive PEFT configuration, it doesn't fully elaborate on how these would be implemented or trained. Overall, the proposal is technically sound with only minor gaps in theoretical justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible research plan with realistic objectives. The core components of the FedPEFT framework—adaptive PEFT allocation and novel aggregation strategies—are implementable with existing technologies and methods. The experimental design is practical, using publicly available datasets and foundation models of manageable size. The proposal acknowledges simulation limitations and provides reasonable proxies for evaluating system efficiency. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The computational resources required for simulating federated learning with foundation models, even with PEFT, could be substantial; (2) The learning-based approach for adaptive PEFT configuration might introduce additional complexity and training overhead; (3) The subspace aggregation strategy, while promising, may be mathematically complex to implement effectively; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle potential instability in training with heterogeneous PEFT configurations. Despite these challenges, the overall research plan is feasible with appropriate resources and technical expertise, though some components may require simplification or refinement during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in the intersection of federated learning and foundation models. Enabling efficient, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of large models on heterogeneous devices has substantial practical implications for deploying advanced AI capabilities in resource-constrained environments. The expected outcomes—particularly the reduction in communication overhead while maintaining model utility—would represent an important advancement in making federated learning more practical for real-world applications. The proposal directly aligns with the workshop's focus on bridging the gap between FL theory and practice. The potential impact spans scientific contributions (novel adaptive methods and aggregation techniques), practical applications (enabling sophisticated AI on edge devices), and societal benefits (democratizing access to AI capabilities while preserving privacy). The significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the advancement over existing federated PEFT methods, but the focus on system heterogeneity and adaptive allocation addresses a critical gap in current approaches. Overall, the proposal has clear potential for meaningful impact in both research and practical deployment of federated learning systems."
