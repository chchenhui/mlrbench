    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'training, fine-tuning, and personalizing (foundation) models in federated settings' and 'scalable and robust federated machine learning systems.' The proposal maintains fidelity to the original idea of using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques in federated settings to reduce communication overhead while preserving privacy. It also builds upon the literature review by acknowledging existing work (like SLoRA, FeDeRA, FedP2EFT) while proposing novel contributions in adaptive PEFT module allocation and aggregation strategies for heterogeneous devices. The mathematical formulations and experimental design are consistent with the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly addressing data heterogeneity, resource constraints, and communication efficiency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are explicitly defined and logically organized. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and motivation. The algorithmic steps and mathematical formulations provide concrete details about the implementation approach. The evaluation metrics are well-specified, covering model performance, communication cost, computation cost, and privacy preservation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific PEFT techniques to be explored beyond the mentioned examples (LoRA, Adapters) could be more detailed, (2) the exact criteria for adaptive PEFT module allocation could be more precisely defined, and (3) the novel aggregation strategies for sparse, low-rank updates could be elaborated further with specific algorithmic details."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with federated learning in a way that addresses heterogeneous device capabilities. While the core concept of applying PEFT in federated settings has been explored in some of the cited literature (e.g., SLoRA, FeDeRA, FedPEFT), this proposal introduces novel elements: (1) adaptive PEFT module allocation based on client device capabilities and data characteristics, which is a fresh approach to handling heterogeneity; (2) specialized aggregation strategies for sparse, low-rank PEFT updates that consider the unique properties of these parameters. The proposal builds incrementally on existing work while offering meaningful innovations, particularly in addressing the practical challenges of deploying foundation models on diverse edge devices. However, it doesn't represent a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift in either federated learning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological approaches. The mathematical formulations for PEFT module updates and aggregation strategies are correctly presented, though somewhat simplified. The research design follows a systematic approach combining theoretical analysis, algorithmic development, and experimental validation. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive, covering performance, efficiency, and privacy aspects. The experimental design includes appropriate baseline comparisons and considers important factors like resource constraints and data heterogeneity. The proposal is grounded in established techniques from both federated learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, there are some areas that could benefit from deeper technical elaboration: (1) the privacy analysis could be more rigorous with formal privacy guarantees, (2) the aggregation strategy formula is quite basic and could be enhanced to better address the challenges of heterogeneous updates, and (3) more detailed discussion of potential convergence issues when combining PEFT with federated optimization would strengthen the technical foundations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current technology and resources. It builds upon existing foundation models and PEFT techniques that are already well-established in the literature. The computational requirements are reasonable, as the approach specifically aims to reduce computational and communication overhead compared to traditional federated learning with full model fine-tuning. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined and implementable with current deep learning frameworks. The experimental design is practical and achievable, with well-defined evaluation metrics. The use of synthetic data for simulating diverse client distributions is a pragmatic approach that enhances feasibility. The proposal also acknowledges resource constraints and explicitly designs solutions to address them, which further increases its practicality. The incremental nature of the research, building on established methods while introducing targeted innovations, contributes to its overall feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant challenge in the deployment of foundation models in federated settings, which is highly relevant to the current research landscape. By enabling efficient, privacy-preserving personalization of large foundation models on diverse edge devices, FedPEFT has the potential to make substantial contributions to both academic research and practical applications. The impact extends to multiple domains where federated learning with large models is desirable but currently limited by resource constraints. The work directly addresses several key challenges identified in the literature review, including data heterogeneity, resource constraints, and communication efficiency. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's focus on practical, real-world applications rather than purely theoretical advancements. However, while the impact is substantial within the federated learning domain, it may not have the transformative, cross-disciplinary impact that would warrant the highest score."
