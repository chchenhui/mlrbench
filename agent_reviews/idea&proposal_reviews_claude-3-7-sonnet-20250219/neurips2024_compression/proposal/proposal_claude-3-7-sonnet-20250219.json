        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the intersection of machine learning and compression, particularly in distributed settings. The proposal builds upon the research idea of using mutual information regularization for neural distributed compression of correlated sources, elaborating it into a comprehensive methodology with theoretical analysis and experimental validation. It also effectively incorporates insights from the literature review, addressing key challenges like modeling complex correlations and establishing theoretical foundations. The proposal's focus on distributed compression with neural networks, information-theoretic principles, and applications to multi-sensor systems aligns perfectly with the workshop's topics of interest."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical formulations are presented with appropriate mathematical notation and explained in sufficient detail. The methodology section is particularly strong, clearly outlining the neural architecture, mutual information regularization approach, and experimental design. The proposal effectively communicates both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as the specific implementation details of the joint decoder and how the theoretical bounds will be empirically validated. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated, with only minor areas that could be further refined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to distributed compression by integrating mutual information regularization with neural compression techniques. While neural compression and distributed source coding have been explored separately (as evidenced in the literature review), the explicit use of mutual information regularization to capture correlations between distributed sources represents a fresh perspective. The proposal innovatively combines concepts from information theory with deep learning techniques, particularly in how it formulates the multi-objective loss function that balances reconstruction quality, coding efficiency, and mutual information maximization. The approach of using continuous latent spaces with MI regularization instead of explicit quantization schemes is particularly innovative. While building upon existing work in neural compression and distributed coding, the proposal offers a distinct and original contribution to the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and sound theoretical foundations. It effectively integrates principles from information theory (Slepian-Wolf theorem, mutual information) with modern neural compression techniques (VAEs, entropy models). The mathematical formulations are correct and well-presented, with clear definitions of the encoder-decoder architecture, loss functions, and mutual information estimation. The proposal includes a comprehensive theoretical analysis section that establishes connections to classical distributed source coding bounds, which strengthens its technical foundation. The experimental design is methodical, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The use of the InfoNCE bound for mutual information estimation is well-justified, and the proposal acknowledges and addresses technical challenges such as the non-differentiability of quantization during training. Overall, the proposal demonstrates excellent technical soundness and rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps for implementation. The neural architecture builds upon established VAE frameworks, and the mutual information regularization approach uses known techniques like InfoNCE bounds. The datasets proposed for evaluation are publicly available and appropriate for the task. However, there are some aspects that may present implementation challenges. The accurate estimation of mutual information in high-dimensional spaces is notoriously difficult, which could impact the effectiveness of the regularization. Additionally, the joint optimization of multiple objectives (reconstruction, rate, mutual information) may require careful tuning of hyperparameters (λ1 and λ2) to achieve the desired balance. The theoretical analysis connecting to classical bounds is ambitious and may require simplifying assumptions. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and methods, though it will require careful engineering and optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in distributed compression with significant potential impact across multiple domains. Efficient compression of correlated sources is crucial for applications in distributed sensing, edge computing, federated learning, and IoT networks where bandwidth constraints are critical. The proposed approach could lead to substantial improvements in compression efficiency for complex, high-dimensional data without requiring explicit knowledge of joint distributions. The theoretical contributions connecting neural compression to classical information-theoretic bounds could advance our fundamental understanding of distributed information processing. The practical implementations could enable more efficient multi-sensor systems and decentralized architectures. The significance extends beyond compression to impact related fields such as representation learning and privacy-preserving data sharing. While the immediate applications are clear, the transformative potential depends on how well the approach generalizes across different types of correlations and data modalities."
