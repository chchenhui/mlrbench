    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the intersection of machine learning, data compression, and information theory by proposing a neural framework for distributed compression using mutual information regularization. The proposal builds upon the research idea of using MI regularization for distributed compression of correlated continuous sources, maintaining fidelity to the core concept while elaborating it with technical depth. It thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like Ozyilkan et al. (2023), Mital et al. (2022), and Whang et al. (2021), and addresses the identified challenges of modeling complex correlations and establishing theoretical foundations. The proposal's objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all consistent with the workshop's themes of enhancing compression techniques and exploring theoretical limits."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated and structured in a logical, easy-to-follow manner. The introduction clearly establishes the background and motivation, while the research objectives are explicitly enumerated. The methodology section provides a detailed mathematical formulation of the MI-RegDSC framework, including the loss function components and training approach. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact architecture of the neural networks for encoders and decoders could be more specifically defined, (2) the implementation details of the MI estimators could be elaborated further, and (3) some technical aspects of the theoretical analysis could be more precisely formulated. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly clear and well-defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to distributed source coding by introducing mutual information regularization between latent representations of correlated sources. This represents a significant departure from existing methods in several ways: (1) Unlike traditional DSC methods that rely on explicit quantization and binning strategies, the proposed approach leverages continuous latent spaces with MI regularization; (2) While recent neural DSC methods like Whang et al. (2021) use VQ-VAE with discrete latent spaces, this proposal focuses on continuous latent representations; (3) The explicit incorporation of MI regularization to encourage correlation-aware representations is distinct from existing approaches that primarily rely on decoder-side fusion or binning discovery. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work while acknowledging its foundations. The combination of VAEs with MI regularization specifically for distributed compression represents a fresh perspective, though individual components (VAEs, MI estimation) are established techniques in other contexts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations from information theory and deep learning. The mathematical formulation of the loss function, incorporating reconstruction loss, rate constraint via KL divergence, and MI regularization, is well-justified. The connection to information-theoretic principles of distributed source coding is appropriately established. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The theoretical analysis of how MI regularization relates to achievable rate-distortion bounds could be more rigorously developed; (2) The proposal acknowledges the challenges of MI estimation but doesn't fully address potential instabilities in training with different estimators; (3) The exact relationship between the proposed continuous latent space approach and classical DSC bounds could be more precisely formulated. While these limitations don't undermine the overall soundness, they represent areas where the theoretical rigor could be enhanced."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and methods. The use of VAEs and neural MI estimators is well-established in the deep learning community, and the necessary datasets (synthetic data, stereo images, sensor data) are readily available. The experimental design is comprehensive and realistic. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) Training neural MI estimators can be unstable and computationally intensive, potentially requiring significant hyperparameter tuning; (2) The joint optimization of encoders, decoders, and MI estimators might face convergence issues; (3) The computational resources required for training on high-dimensional data like images could be substantial; (4) The comparison with some baselines, particularly reimplementing state-of-the-art methods like Whang et al. (2021) or Ozyilkan et al. (2023), might be challenging if code is not available. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent practical hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed during implementation."

        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in distributed compression with significant potential impact. If successful, the research would: (1) Advance the state-of-the-art in neural distributed compression, particularly for continuous sources with complex correlations; (2) Bridge the gap between information theory and deep learning by providing a principled approach to exploiting inter-source correlations; (3) Enable more efficient communication in distributed systems like sensor networks, multi-view imaging, and federated learning; (4) Contribute theoretical insights into the relationship between mutual information regularization and compression performance. The work directly addresses the workshop's themes and could influence both theoretical research and practical applications in distributed AI systems. The significance is well-articulated in the proposal, with clear connections to real-world applications and broader impacts on efficient information processing systems. While not necessarily transformative of the entire field, the research would make a substantial contribution to an important and growing area at the intersection of machine learning and information theory."
