    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the intersection of machine learning, compression, and information theory, particularly in distributed settings. The proposal builds upon the literature review by extending neural distributed compression techniques with mutual information regularization, addressing the key challenges identified in the review such as modeling complex correlations and establishing theoretical foundations. The methodology clearly implements the main idea of using MI-regularized VAEs for distributed compression, and the experimental design includes appropriate datasets and baselines mentioned in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that some references in the proposal (e.g., [7], [10]) don't perfectly match the literature review numbering, but this doesn't significantly impact the overall coherence."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated, the methodology is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations, and the experimental design is comprehensive. The framework overview provides a clear picture of the proposed approach, and the objective function is well-defined. The theoretical analysis section effectively connects the proposed method to information-theoretic concepts. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the multi-way mutual information estimation for N>2 sources could be more explicitly defined, as the proposal mainly elaborates on the pairwise case; (2) the connection between the theoretical analysis and the experimental metrics could be more directly established; and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the alternating optimization procedure could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong novelty in several aspects. It introduces a novel approach to neural distributed compression by explicitly incorporating mutual information regularization between latent representations, which is a fresh perspective compared to existing methods in the literature. The theoretical connection between MI regularization and Slepian-Wolf bounds for continuous sources represents an original contribution. The proposal also innovates by replacing explicit quantization with continuous, correlation-aware latent spaces. While some elements build upon existing work (VAEs, InfoNCE loss, distributed compression frameworks), the combination and application of these elements to address distributed compression with theoretical guarantees is innovative. The proposal doesn't completely revolutionize the field but offers a significant advancement over existing approaches like those described in the literature review (e.g., Neural Distributed Source Coding, Neural Distributed Compressor)."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations from information theory and deep learning. The mathematical formulations for the objective function, MI estimation, and theoretical analysis are mostly correct and well-presented. The connection to Slepian-Wolf bounds and rate-distortion theory is appropriate. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics for evaluation. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) the theoretical analysis of the achievable rate-distortion trade-off could benefit from more formal derivation or proof; (2) the multi-way mutual information estimation for N>2 sources is mentioned but not fully developed; (3) the proposal doesn't thoroughly address potential challenges in optimizing the complex objective function with competing terms; and (4) the theoretical guarantees for convergence of the alternating optimization procedure are not provided."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and methods. The VAE-based architecture, MI estimation techniques, and experimental datasets are all accessible and have been used in prior work. The alternating optimization procedure is a practical approach to training the proposed model. However, there are some implementation challenges that affect the feasibility score: (1) accurate estimation of mutual information in high-dimensional spaces is known to be difficult and may require large batch sizes or sophisticated estimators; (2) the computational resources needed for training multiple encoders with MI regularization could be substantial; (3) the proposal doesn't fully address potential optimization difficulties when balancing reconstruction quality with MI maximization; and (4) the expected performance gains (15-20% reduction in coding rate) seem optimistic without preliminary results to support this claim."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in distributed compression with significant potential impact. If successful, the research would bridge the gap between neural compression methods and information-theoretic bounds, providing both practical improvements and theoretical insights. The expected outcomes include substantial compression rate improvements for multi-view imagery and multi-sensor data, which would benefit applications in IoT systems, federated learning, and edge computing. The theoretical advances in connecting MI regularization to Slepian-Wolf-like efficiency for continuous sources would contribute valuable knowledge to the field. The broader impact section convincingly argues for the relevance of this work to distributed systems, communication-efficient machine learning, and information theory. The significance is slightly limited by the focus on specific data types (images and sensor data) rather than a more general framework applicable to all data modalities."
