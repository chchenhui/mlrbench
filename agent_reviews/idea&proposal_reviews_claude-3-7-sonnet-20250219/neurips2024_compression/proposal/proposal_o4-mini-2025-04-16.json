    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the intersection of machine learning and compression, focusing on neural distributed compression with theoretical foundations - a key topic mentioned in the workshop call. The proposal builds upon the literature review by extending works like 'Neural Distributed Compressor Discovers Binning' and 'Neural Distributed Image Compression with Cross-Attention' while addressing their theoretical limitations. The mutual information regularization approach is consistent with the research idea of creating a 'mutual information (MI)-regularized neural framework' for distributed compression. The proposal comprehensively covers all aspects mentioned in the task description, including improvements in learning-based compression techniques, theoretical understanding of neural compression methods, and information-theoretic principles."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined, and the technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The problem formulation, model architecture, objective function, and training algorithm are all precisely described. The experimental design section provides specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact relationship between the MI regularization and the Slepian-Wolf bounds could be more explicitly formulated, (2) some technical details about the implementation of the critic network for MI estimation could be elaborated, and (3) the proposal could more clearly explain how the continuous latent representations will be quantized for practical transmission."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining mutual information regularization with neural distributed compression for continuous sources. While individual components (VAEs for compression, MI estimation, distributed coding) exist in prior work, their integration into a unified framework with theoretical analysis is novel. The approach of replacing explicit quantization with continuous latent representations regularized by MI is a fresh perspective. However, the proposal shares similarities with existing approaches in the literature review, particularly works on neural distributed compression. The MI regularization technique, while innovative in this context, builds upon established methods like MINE. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines the field, offering an evolutionary rather than revolutionary advancement."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates strong theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulation of the problem, objective function, and MI estimation is rigorous and well-justified. The connection to classical information theory concepts (Slepian-Wolf theorem, rate-distortion theory) is appropriate and strengthens the theoretical grounding. The training algorithm is well-defined and follows established practices in deep learning. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The proposal acknowledges the challenges in MI estimation and offers solutions like MINE. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further rigor: (1) the theoretical analysis section promises bounds relating MI regularization to rate-distortion functions but doesn't fully detail the proof approach, (2) the exact mechanism by which MI regularization induces 'binning-like behavior' could be more thoroughly explained, and (3) the statistical guarantees of the approach could be more explicitly addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The neural network architectures (VAEs, critic networks) are well-established and implementable. The datasets mentioned (KITTI, Cityscapes) are publicly available, and synthetic Gaussian data can be easily generated. The training procedure follows standard practices in deep learning. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) MI estimation in high-dimensional spaces is known to be difficult and may require significant computational resources, (2) the joint training of encoders, decoders, and MI estimators might face optimization difficulties due to competing objectives, (3) the scalability to many sources (N>2) might be challenging due to the quadratic growth in pairwise MI terms, and (4) the theoretical analysis connecting MI regularization to rate-distortion bounds may be mathematically challenging. These challenges are manageable but will require careful implementation and possibly some methodological adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem at the intersection of machine learning and information theory with significant potential impact. Successful implementation would advance distributed compression for modern multi-sensor and multi-view data, with applications in IoT networks, federated learning, and low-bandwidth communication. The theoretical contributions would strengthen the bridge between deep learning and information theory, providing principled guidance for neural compression system design. The practical significance is high for resource-constrained environments where efficient distributed compression is crucial. The proposal could influence future research in joint source-channel coding, privacy-preserving compression, and adaptive streaming. While the impact is substantial within its domain, it may not be transformative across the broader field of machine learning or information theory, which prevents it from receiving the highest score."
