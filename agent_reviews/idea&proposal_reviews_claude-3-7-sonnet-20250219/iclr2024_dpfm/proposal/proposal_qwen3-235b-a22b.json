    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric AI approaches for foundation models, particularly emphasizing safety, alignment, and efficiency. The proposal builds upon the literature review by incorporating concepts from Safety Pretraining (Maini et al., 2025), Safer-Instruct (Shi et al., 2023), and RAFT (Dong et al., 2023), while extending these approaches with a novel RL-based framework for data curation. The methodology section clearly implements the core idea of using reinforcement learning to guide data selection, with detailed explanations of the reward function that combines toxicity scores and alignment signals. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions Controllable Safety Alignment (Zhang et al., 2024), the proposal doesn't explicitly incorporate this aspect of adaptable safety requirements at inference time."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The problem formulation is precisely defined using mathematical notation, and the RL framework is thoroughly explained with equations for the reward function and PPO objective. The algorithmic workflow provides a step-by-step explanation of the approach, making implementation feasible. The experimental design is comprehensive, detailing datasets, baselines, metrics, and training protocols. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for updating the alignment signal A(x,y) could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the policy model π_θ and the foundation model M_φ could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'Negative Effect Filtering') are mentioned without sufficient explanation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel combination of existing techniques rather than a completely groundbreaking approach. Its primary innovation lies in applying reinforcement learning to the data curation process for foundation models, creating a closed-loop system that dynamically updates selection policies based on model performance. This represents a significant advancement over static filtering approaches. The composite reward function that balances safety and alignment is also innovative. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing work: the use of toxicity detectors (from Safety Pretraining), alignment signals from labeled probes (similar to Safer-Instruct), and the general concept of reward-based selection (related to RAFT). While the proposal synthesizes these elements into a coherent framework, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical insights."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The MDP formulation for the data curation problem is mathematically sound, and the PPO algorithm is an appropriate choice for the RL component. The reward function design balancing safety and alignment metrics is well-justified, and the experimental design includes appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are thoughtfully designed to test key components of the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential ethical considerations and includes mechanisms to address bias and data sensitivity. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the approach: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential instabilities in RL training, (2) there's limited discussion of how to prevent reward hacking or gaming of the selection policy, and (3) the theoretical guarantees for convergence of the closed-loop system aren't provided."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined implementation steps. The hardware requirements (8× A100 GPUs, 128 accelerators) are substantial but realistic for modern ML research. The use of existing models (LLaMA-7B, distilled RoBERTa) and APIs (Perspective API) reduces implementation complexity. The experimental design includes reasonable stopping criteria and ablation studies. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) the computational cost of repeatedly fine-tuning foundation models in the closed loop could be prohibitive, (2) the proposal requires a substantial labeled dataset D_probe for alignment signals, which may be difficult to obtain, (3) the stability of the RL training process at scale is uncertain, and (4) the timeline for implementing such a complex system isn't specified. While these challenges don't render the approach impractical, they do represent significant hurdles that would need to be addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety and alignment that has substantial real-world implications. By embedding safety considerations into the pretraining phase through data curation, it could significantly reduce harmful outputs from foundation models while maintaining their capabilities. The approach has the potential to scale to petabyte-sized datasets, addressing a major bottleneck in current safety alignment techniques. The broader impacts identified—including automated governance, data economics, and policy influence—highlight the proposal's significance beyond technical contributions. The expected outcomes are ambitious but reasonable, with quantifiable targets for safety improvement (40% toxicity reduction) and performance preservation (±5% perplexity). The proposal also connects to important societal concerns around AI governance and regulation. While not completely transformative of the field, successful implementation would represent a significant advancement in data-centric approaches to AI safety."
