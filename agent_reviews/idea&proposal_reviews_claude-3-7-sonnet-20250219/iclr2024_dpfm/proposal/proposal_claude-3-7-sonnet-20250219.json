    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the data-centric approach to AI safety and alignment for foundation models as specified in the task. The proposal expands on the core idea of using reinforcement learning for data curation to improve safety alignment, maintaining all key elements from the original idea while providing substantial elaboration. The literature review is well-integrated throughout the proposal, with explicit references to Safety Pretraining (Maini et al., 2025) and Safer-Instruct (Shi et al., 2023). The methodology incorporates insights from these works, such as embedding safety during pretraining rather than just fine-tuning and using automated evaluation approaches. The proposal comprehensively addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, including data quality, scalability of curation, alignment with human values, evaluation of safety, and balancing safety with performance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail. The methodology section provides a comprehensive explanation of the framework components, including mathematical formulations for the reward model and policy optimization. The implementation details are presented in a pseudo-code format that enhances understanding. Diagrams are referenced (e.g., 'Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture') though not actually provided in the text. Some technical concepts could benefit from additional explanation for non-expert readers, particularly in the reinforcement learning formulation. The relationship between the different components of the reward function could be more explicitly connected to the overall objectives. Despite these minor issues, the proposal is generally clear and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to data curation for foundation models by applying reinforcement learning techniques to dynamically select and weight training samples. This represents a significant departure from traditional static filtering or post-training interventions. The RL-DDC framework innovatively combines several existing concepts (reinforcement learning, safety metrics, data curation) into a new integrated system. The composite reward function that balances safety, alignment, and diversity is a thoughtful innovation. However, the approach builds heavily on existing work in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and automated data curation, adapting these techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. The proposal acknowledges its relationship to prior work like Safety Pretraining and Safer-Instruct, positioning itself as an extension and improvement rather than a completely novel paradigm. While not revolutionary, the proposal offers meaningful innovation in applying RL to the specific problem of data curation for safety alignment."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations in reinforcement learning and foundation model training. The RL formulation as a Markov Decision Process is appropriate, and the use of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is well-justified given its stability in complex decision-making tasks. The composite reward function is thoughtfully designed to capture multiple dimensions of safety and alignment. The technical formulations, including the objective function for policy optimization, are correctly presented. However, there are some areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened. The proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in reward modeling, such as reward hacking or misspecification. The assumption that the reward model can effectively capture complex safety and alignment considerations may be optimistic. The transition dynamics in the MDP formulation are somewhat underspecified, particularly how the state representation captures the current dataset composition. While the methodology is generally rigorous, these gaps suggest some theoretical aspects require further development."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach but faces significant implementation challenges. The computational resources required for training both the foundation model and the RL agent would be substantial, especially for iterative training cycles. The data pool management system would need to efficiently handle extremely large datasets, which presents engineering challenges. The reward model design relies on existing toxicity classifiers and alignment metrics, which may not be sufficiently robust or comprehensive. The proposal acknowledges these challenges by starting with a smaller model (1-2B parameters) for rapid iteration, which is a practical approach. The iterative training process is well-defined and implementable. However, the effectiveness of the RL agent in learning a useful data selection policy depends on the quality of the reward signals, which may be difficult to define for subtle safety and alignment issues. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive but would require significant resources to implement fully. Overall, while the approach is technically implementable, it would require considerable resources and may face challenges in effectively capturing complex safety and alignment considerations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety and alignment that has broad implications for the responsible development of foundation models. If successful, the RL-DDC framework would provide a scalable, automated approach to data curation that could significantly improve the safety properties of foundation models without sacrificing performance. This would address a major bottleneck in current alignment approaches, which often rely on expensive human feedback or rigid filtering techniques. The expected outcomes include substantial reductions in harmful outputs (40-60%) while maintaining model capabilities (no more than 5% degradation), which would represent a meaningful advancement in the field. The approach also contributes methodological innovations in applying RL to data curation and developing integrated reward models for safety alignment. The broader impacts include safer AI deployment, more economical alignment techniques, improved transparency, and potential influence on industry standards. The significance extends beyond the immediate research community to the broader societal implications of AI development, making this a highly impactful proposal."
