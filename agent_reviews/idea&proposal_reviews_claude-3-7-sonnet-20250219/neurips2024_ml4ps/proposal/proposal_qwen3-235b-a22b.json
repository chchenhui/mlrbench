    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the intersection of machine learning and physical sciences, particularly emphasizing the bidirectional relationship between ML and PS. The proposal incorporates physical inductive biases into self-supervised learning frameworks as outlined in the research idea, and builds upon the literature review by citing and extending concepts from physics-guided neural networks, PINNs, and other relevant works. The methodology section clearly outlines how physical laws will be integrated into the learning process through physics-aware pretext tasks and differentiable physics modules, which is consistent with both the task requirements and the initial idea. The proposal also addresses the workshop's interest in the complementarity between foundation models and approaches leveraging physical inductive biases."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and motivation. The methodology section provides concrete details about the three core components of the PG-SSL framework: physics-aware pretext tasks, differentiable physics modules, and model architecture. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented, with clear equations for physical constraints like mass conservation and Hamiltonian dynamics. The experimental design outlines specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further elaboration, such as more detailed descriptions of how the adaptive weighting schemes would work in practice and clearer connections between the specific physics-aware pretext tasks and the downstream applications. Overall, the main points are understandable and the structure is logical, with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a unified framework (PG-SSL) that systematically incorporates physical inductive biases into self-supervised learning. While individual components like physics-informed neural networks and self-supervised learning exist separately in the literature, the integration of these approaches into a cohesive framework with physics-aware pretext tasks represents a fresh perspective. The proposal extends beyond existing work like PGRNNs and PGFMs by generalizing across multiple scientific domains and focusing specifically on the pretraining pipeline. However, it builds incrementally on existing concepts rather than introducing completely novel theoretical foundations. The physics-aware pretext tasks and differentiable physics modules are innovative combinations of existing techniques rather than fundamentally new approaches. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work while acknowledging its foundations in existing literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates rigorous methodology. It builds upon well-established theoretical foundations in both machine learning (self-supervised learning) and physics (conservation laws, Hamiltonian mechanics). The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented, with appropriate equations for physical constraints. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (vanilla SSL, PINNs, hybrid methods) and evaluation metrics that measure both prediction accuracy and physical consistency. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, such as computational complexity, and suggests mitigation strategies. The methodology is well-justified through references to existing literature and physical principles. There are some minor areas that could benefit from more detailed justification, such as the specific choice of adaptive weights in the loss function, but overall, the approach is robust and well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The core components—self-supervised learning frameworks, differentiable physics solvers, and neural network architectures like GNNs and ViTs—are all established technologies. The datasets mentioned (OQMD, fluid dynamics simulations, climate data) are available and have been used in similar research. However, integrating differentiable physics modules into self-supervised learning frameworks may require considerable engineering effort and computational resources. The proposal acknowledges this challenge and suggests adaptive weighting schemes as a mitigation strategy, which is realistic. The experimental design is comprehensive but ambitious, covering multiple scientific domains that may each present unique challenges. While the overall approach is implementable, successful execution would likely require significant expertise in both machine learning and the specific physical domains, as well as substantial computational resources for training models with physics-based constraints."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem at the intersection of machine learning and physical sciences: how to leverage unlabeled data while ensuring physical consistency. This has significant implications for scientific discovery in data-limited domains such as climate modeling, materials science, and fluid dynamics. The expected outcomes include improved data efficiency (reducing reliance on labeled data) and enhanced physical consistency of predictions, which directly address critical challenges in scientific machine learning. The proposal quantifies expected improvements (15-30% in prediction accuracy) and connects these to real-world applications. The framework's potential to accelerate high-throughput screening in materials science and improve climate modeling fidelity demonstrates clear pathways to impact. While the significance is high within the scientific machine learning community, the broader impact beyond specialized scientific domains may be more limited. Nevertheless, the proposal has the potential to make meaningful contributions to multiple scientific fields and advance the state of the art in physics-guided machine learning."
