        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice' topic. It directly tackles the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon mentioned in the task description and explores continuous approximations of training trajectories using stochastic differential equations. The proposal aims to bridge optimization theory with practical needs in large-scale deep learning, which is the central theme of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other topics mentioned in the task description like generalization or foundation models, though it does have implications for them."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation clearly establishes the problem context regarding the gap between classical convergence theory and modern deep learning practices. The main idea articulates a specific approach using continuous approximations of gradient dynamics and incorporating curvature estimates. The expected outcomes are concrete (2-3x speedups). However, some technical details about the specific mathematical formulations of the proposed stochastic differential equations and how exactly the curvature estimates will be computed and incorporated could be further elaborated to achieve perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to understanding and exploiting the Edge of Stability phenomenon. While the EoS itself has been observed and studied before, the proposal to develop a hybrid theoretical-empirical framework that explicitly models gradient noise and curvature to design an adaptive optimization algorithm represents a fresh perspective. The integration of low-cost Hessian approximations for curvature-aware updates is innovative. However, the core components (SDEs for optimization, curvature estimation) build upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The proposed approach builds on established mathematical tools (SDEs, Hessian approximations) and optimization techniques. The researchers can leverage existing deep learning frameworks and optimization libraries. However, there are moderate challenges: accurately estimating curvature in very large models can be computationally expensive even with approximations, and the theoretical analysis of non-convex landscapes with noise is notoriously difficult. The claimed 2-3x speedup is ambitious and may require significant refinement of the initial approach to achieve consistently across different model architectures."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in modern deep learning: the inefficiency of training large-scale models without proper theoretical guidance. If successful, this work could significantly reduce computational costs, energy consumption, and development time for foundation models - a major concern in the field. The potential impact extends beyond theoretical understanding to practical benefits in an era where training costs for large models can run into millions of dollars. The work bridges a fundamental gap between theory and practice that has persisted despite the rapid advancement of deep learning, making it highly significant to the field."
