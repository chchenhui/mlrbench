        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice' focus area. It directly tackles the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon mentioned in the task description and aims to explain how optimization methods can minimize training losses despite large learning rates. The proposal seeks to bridge the gap between theory and practice by developing a mathematical framework that explains observed phenomena in modern deep learning optimization. The idea also touches on continuous approximations of training trajectories using SDEs, which is another explicitly mentioned topic in the task description. The research would provide practical guidelines for large model training, addressing the task's concern about the costs of trial and error with billion-parameter models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly defines the problem (understanding the Edge of Stability phenomenon), proposes a specific approach (using modified gradient flows and stochastic differential equations), and outlines expected outcomes (convergence guarantees and practical guidelines). The motivation is well-articulated, explaining why classical theory fails and why this research matters. The methodology involving the integration of stochastic gradient noise and Hessian spectral properties is specified. However, some technical details about the 'modified gradient flows' could be more precisely defined, and the exact mathematical formulation of the proposed stochastic differential equations is not fully elaborated, which prevents a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to a known but poorly understood phenomenon. While the Edge of Stability itself has been observed and documented in recent literature, the proposed theoretical framework that integrates stochastic gradient noise with Hessian spectral properties to explain EoS represents a fresh perspective. The concept of using modified gradient flows to model non-monotonic loss behavior is innovative. The research doesn't merely observe the phenomenon but attempts to build a comprehensive mathematical theory that could fundamentally change how we understand optimization in deep learning. It's not entirely groundbreaking as it builds upon existing concepts of gradient flows and stochastic differential equations, but it applies them in a novel way to explain previously unexplained phenomena."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible but faces some implementation challenges. The theoretical component involving stochastic differential equations and Hessian analysis is well-established in mathematics, making the analytical framework achievable. The empirical validation on vision transformers and LLMs is also feasible with current technology, though it would require significant computational resources. The main challenges lie in accurately modeling the complex dynamics at the Edge of Stability and deriving meaningful convergence guarantees that hold in practice. The Hessian computation for large models can be computationally expensive, potentially requiring approximation methods. While these challenges are substantial, they don't appear insurmountable given current mathematical tools and computational capabilities, making the overall idea feasible with moderate refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in optimization theory that has significant practical implications. Understanding the Edge of Stability could lead to major advancements in training efficiency for large-scale models, potentially saving enormous computational resources and enabling faster progress in AI development. The work directly tackles one of the most pressing issues in modern deep learning: the disconnect between theory and practice in optimization. If successful, the research would provide both theoretical insights (convergence guarantees) and practical benefits (optimization guidelines) that could influence how all large models are trained. The significance is particularly high given the current trend toward increasingly large and expensive models, where optimization efficiency directly translates to substantial cost savings and reduced environmental impact."
