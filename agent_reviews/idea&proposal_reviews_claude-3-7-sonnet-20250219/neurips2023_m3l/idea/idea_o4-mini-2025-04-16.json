    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, particularly with the 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice' focus area. It directly addresses the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon mentioned in the task description and proposes a theoretical framework (Spectral Stochastic Flow) that bridges discrete SGD practice with continuous theory. The idea also tackles the challenge of hyperparameter tuning for large models, which is explicitly mentioned as a critical issue in the task description. The proposal aims to provide principled guidance for training large models, which is the central theme of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly defines the problem (controlling the Edge of Stability regime), proposes a specific solution (Spectral Stochastic Flow), and outlines a concrete methodology with three well-defined steps. The expected outcomes are also explicitly stated. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how the subspace-iteration for Hessian eigenpair estimation would work at scale, and how exactly the diffusion term calibration would be implemented. These details would likely be elaborated in a full paper, so the idea is still very well-articulated overall."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The concept of modeling SGD with momentum as a Spectral Stochastic Flow that focuses on top-k Hessian eigenspaces is an innovative approach to understanding optimization dynamics. The adaptive spectral step-sizer that scales learning rates per eigenmode represents a fresh perspective on adaptive optimization. While stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have been used to model SGD before, the spectral projection approach and its application to the Edge of Stability phenomenon appears to be original. The idea combines existing concepts (Hessian eigenanalysis, SDEs, adaptive learning rates) in a new way rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, which is why it scores an 8 rather than higher."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible but faces some implementation challenges. The three-step methodology is well-defined and builds on established techniques. However, computing Hessian eigenpairs for large models is computationally expensive, even with efficient approximation methods like subspace-iteration. The proposal acknowledges this challenge but doesn't fully address how it will be made tractable for billion-parameter models. The validation on ResNet and Transformer benchmarks is realistic, but scaling to truly large models might require additional computational optimizations not specified in the proposal. The theoretical framework seems sound, and the adaptive step-sizer concept is implementable, making the overall approach feasible with moderate refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in modern deep learning: the gap between optimization theory and practice, particularly in the Edge of Stability regime. If successful, it could significantly impact how large models are trained by reducing hyperparameter tuning overhead and providing principled guidance for learning rate selection. The potential for faster convergence and controlled training would have substantial practical benefits for the ML community, especially as models continue to grow in size. The theoretical contribution of connecting discrete SGD dynamics to continuous SDEs in the spectral domain could advance our fundamental understanding of deep learning optimization. The work directly addresses one of the main challenges identified in the workshop description, making it highly significant to the field."
