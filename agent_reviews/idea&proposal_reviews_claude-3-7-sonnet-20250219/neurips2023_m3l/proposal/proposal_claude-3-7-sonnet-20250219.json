    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Reconciling Optimization Theory with Deep Learning Practice' topic from the task description, focusing specifically on the Edge of Stability phenomenon mentioned as a key area of interest. The proposal expands on the research idea by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework and an adaptive optimization algorithm (EAGD) that leverages EoS dynamics. The literature review's focus on EoS and continuous-time approximations is thoroughly incorporated, with the proposal building upon Cohen et al.'s empirical observations and extending the theoretical work of Arora et al. The proposal also addresses the computational efficiency concerns highlighted in both the task description and research idea, aiming to reduce training costs for large-scale models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from theoretical foundations to practical implementation and evaluation. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly in the continuous-time approximation and the EAGD algorithm. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of each component, including the SDE framework, stability analysis, and algorithm development. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering diverse model architectures and evaluation metrics. However, some technical aspects could benefit from additional clarification, such as the exact mechanism for estimating the principal eigenvector efficiently in large-scale settings, and more details on how the adaptive coefficient β_t is computed based on curvature information."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The continuous-time approximation that explicitly models the interaction between curvature and parameter updates represents a fresh approach to understanding EoS dynamics. The proposed Edge-Adaptive Gradient Descent (EAGD) algorithm is innovative in its dynamic adjustment of learning rates and momentum parameters based on curvature estimates. The coupled modeling of parameter updates and eigenvalue evolution is particularly original. While building on existing work on EoS (Cohen et al.) and continuous-time approximations, the proposal extends these ideas in novel directions by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework and practical algorithm. The approach of maintaining operation at EoS while preventing divergence through curvature-aware updates is distinct from existing optimization methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a strong theoretical basis in optimization theory, stochastic differential equations, and spectral analysis. The continuous-time approximation builds logically on established mathematical frameworks, and the stability analysis follows from first principles. The EAGD algorithm is derived from the theoretical insights in a principled manner. However, there are some potential gaps in the theoretical development. The relationship between the discrete-time optimization and the continuous SDE approximation could be more rigorously established, particularly regarding the validity of this approximation at large learning rates characteristic of EoS. Additionally, while the proposal mentions convergence guarantees, it doesn't fully detail the conditions under which these guarantees would hold, especially given the non-convex nature of deep learning loss landscapes."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with careful consideration of computational efficiency. The implementation details for EAGD address key practical concerns, such as using randomized algorithms for Hessian-vector products and performing curvature estimation at reduced frequency. The experimental design is comprehensive and realistic, covering a range of model architectures and datasets. However, some aspects present feasibility challenges. The Lanczos algorithm for eigenvalue estimation, while more efficient than explicit Hessian computation, still introduces significant computational overhead for very large models. The proposal acknowledges this and suggests strategies to mitigate the cost, but the trade-off between accuracy of curvature estimation and computational efficiency may be more challenging than anticipated. The scaling experiments with truly large-scale models (>1B parameters) would require substantial computational resources, and while the proposal mentions establishing partnerships, securing such resources remains a practical challenge."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental gap between optimization theory and deep learning practice, with potential for high-impact contributions. Understanding and leveraging the EoS phenomenon could significantly reduce the computational and environmental costs of training large-scale models, directly addressing a critical need identified in the task description. The expected 2-3x reduction in training time for large models would have substantial practical benefits for AI research and applications. The theoretical advancements would contribute to a more principled understanding of deep learning optimization, potentially influencing future algorithm development. The practical impact extends to democratizing AI research by making it more accessible to institutions with limited resources. The proposal also identifies promising future research directions, indicating potential for long-term influence on the field. The work directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging theory and practice in modern machine learning."
