    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on bridging machine learning and genomics for drug discovery. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the task description, including causal representation learning, foundation models for genomics, perturbation biology, graph neural networks, multimodal representation learning, and active learning in genomics. The proposal specifically targets the workshop's goal of improving target identification for drug discovery by developing models that can distinguish correlation from causation in genomic data. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address the LLMs/Agentic AI special track, but this isn't necessary as it strongly aligns with the main track topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined problem (distinguishing correlation from causation in genomics data for drug target discovery) and a structured solution approach. The proposal clearly outlines three key innovations and expected outcomes. The technical components (GNNs, structural causal modeling, self-supervised pre-training, active learning) are well-specified. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific mechanisms for integrating counterfactual reasoning with GNNs and how the model will handle the heterogeneity of multimodal perturbation datasets. The overall architecture and workflow are clear, but these implementation details would strengthen the clarity further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to combining causal inference with foundation models in genomics. While both foundation models and causal inference have been explored separately in computational biology, their integration specifically for target discovery using multimodal perturbation data represents an innovative direction. The hybrid architecture combining GNNs with counterfactual reasoning is particularly novel, as is the application of active learning to prioritize experimental validation. The approach of using self-supervised pre-training on heterogeneous omics data followed by fine-tuning on disease-specific perturbation datasets also represents a fresh methodology. The idea doesn't completely reinvent the field but rather combines existing techniques in a novel way that could potentially lead to significant advances in drug target discovery."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. While the individual components (GNNs, causal modeling, self-supervised learning) are established techniques, integrating them into a unified framework that can effectively model causal relationships in complex biological systems is ambitious. The proposal requires access to diverse perturbation datasets (CRISPR screens, drug-response profiles, single-cell RNA-seq) which may be limited or heterogeneous in quality. Causal inference in biological systems is notoriously difficult due to the complexity of cellular networks and confounding factors. The active learning component would require significant experimental resources for validation. While the technical approach is sound, the biological complexity and data requirements present substantial implementation challenges that may require considerable refinement of the methodology during execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is exceptionally high. Drug discovery has a notoriously high failure rate, with many candidates failing in clinical trials due to poor target selection. A model that can accurately distinguish causal from merely correlated relationships in genomic data would address a fundamental challenge in the field. If successful, this approach could dramatically improve target identification, reduce costly failed clinical trials, and accelerate the development of effective therapies for complex diseases. The potential to generalize across tissues and modalities further enhances its impact. The integration of causal reasoning with foundation models could establish a new paradigm in computational drug discovery that extends beyond pattern recognition to mechanistic understanding, directly addressing one of the most critical bottlenecks in modern pharmaceutical research."
