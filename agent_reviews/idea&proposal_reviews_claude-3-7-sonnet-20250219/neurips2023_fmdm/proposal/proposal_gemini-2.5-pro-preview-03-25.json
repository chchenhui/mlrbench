        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge identified in the task description: 'Foundation models are trained on data without actions. How to overcome this limitation from both the dataset and modeling perspectives?' The Sim2Act framework provides a comprehensive solution by generating action-annotated data through self-supervised simulation. The proposal maintains fidelity to the original idea of leveraging simulated environments to produce (observation, language, action) triplets and using iterative bootstrapping to improve policies. It incorporates the literature effectively, referencing works like Yang et al. (2023) on foundation models for decision making, Ye et al. (2023) on reinforcement learning with foundation priors, and addressing the sim-to-real gap highlighted by Green & Black (2024). The methodology aligns with the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly regarding data generation, multi-modal integration, and sample efficiency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The Sim2Act framework is explained in detail, with clear descriptions of each component: task generation, exploratory interaction, data logging, model training, and policy improvement. The technical aspects are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, particularly in the training procedure section where the loss functions are explicitly defined. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined baselines, evaluation tasks, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for mapping language model outputs to simulator actions in the initial exploratory policy could be more precisely defined, (2) the criteria for determining when to transition from one iteration to the next in the bootstrapping process could be more explicit, and (3) some technical details about the contrastive learning implementation (e.g., how negative samples are selected) could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to addressing the action gap in foundation models through self-supervised data generation in simulation. The iterative bootstrapping process, where each improved policy generates better data for the next training cycle, is an innovative aspect that distinguishes this work from standard imitation learning or reinforcement learning approaches. The combination of behavior cloning with contrastive learning for action prediction is also relatively novel in this context. However, the core components build upon existing techniques: behavior cloning is well-established, contrastive learning has been applied to robotics before (as noted in the literature review), and using simulation for data generation is not new. The proposal innovatively combines these elements but doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithmic approaches. The novelty lies more in the comprehensive framework and its application to the specific problem of grounding foundation models with action data, rather than in developing entirely new technical methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness in its approach. The methodology is well-grounded in established techniques from machine learning, with clear formulations of the learning objectives and model architecture. The behavior cloning and contrastive learning losses are properly defined, and the overall training procedure follows sound principles. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that will allow for rigorous assessment of the method's performance. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges, particularly in the sim-to-real transfer section, showing awareness of the limitations. The iterative bootstrapping approach is theoretically justified, resembling policy iteration in reinforcement learning. However, there are some potential concerns: (1) the initial exploratory policy might struggle to generate useful data if it performs poorly, potentially creating a cold-start problem, (2) there's a risk of compounding errors in the iterative process if unsuccessful trajectories are included in the training data, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of how to ensure diversity in the generated data to prevent overfitting to specific scenarios."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, leveraging existing simulation platforms (Habitat, Isaac Gym, AI2-THOR) and model architectures. The core components—simulation environments, foundation models, and training procedures—are all available and have been used in prior research. The iterative data generation and model training pipeline is implementable with current technology. However, there are several practical challenges that affect feasibility: (1) Computational resources: Generating millions of interaction samples across diverse environments will require substantial computing power, especially if high-fidelity rendering is needed. (2) Simulation fidelity: The quality of the generated data depends heavily on the realism of the simulators, which may not perfectly capture real-world physics and visual appearance. (3) Bootstrapping effectiveness: The success of the iterative approach depends on the initial policy generating sufficiently useful data, which is not guaranteed. (4) Sim-to-real transfer: While acknowledged as a 'stretch goal,' this remains a significant challenge that may limit practical applicability. Overall, while the core research is feasible, achieving all stated objectives, particularly the sim-to-real transfer, may require more resources and time than implied."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental limitation of foundation models—their lack of action-conditioned data—which is explicitly identified in the task description as a key challenge. Successfully bridging this gap would have far-reaching implications for the application of foundation models to interactive domains like robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. The potential impact is significant in several ways: (1) Scientific advancement: The research could establish a new paradigm for grounding foundation models in interactive environments, contributing fundamental knowledge to the field. (2) Practical applications: The approach could accelerate progress in robotics and autonomous systems by reducing the need for expensive real-world data collection. (3) Democratization: The proposed dataset and framework could lower barriers to entry for researchers in this interdisciplinary area. (4) Generalization: The multi-task, multi-environment approach could lead to more general-purpose agents capable of handling diverse tasks. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's alignment with current research trends and its potential to influence future work in foundation models for decision making."
