        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge identified in the task description: 'Foundation models are trained on data without actions. How to overcome this limitation from both the dataset and modeling perspectives?' The Sim2Act framework provides a comprehensive solution by generating action-conditioned data through simulated environments. The proposal expands on the initial idea by detailing the methodology for self-supervised action data generation, including the exploration policy, data collection and filtering, model architecture, and iterative bootstrapping process. It also addresses multiple topics mentioned in the task description, such as multi-modal learning, foundation model agents interacting with tools and simulators, and applying foundation models to traditional decision-making problems. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, particularly addressing challenges like data generation, sim-to-real transfer, multi-modal integration, sample efficiency, and long-horizon planning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and motivation. The methodology section is comprehensive, with detailed explanations of each component of the Sim2Act framework, including mathematical formulations for the learning objectives. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, providing a clear roadmap for validating the approach. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific action spaces for different environments could be more explicitly defined, (2) the details of how the language-conditioned exploration module generates action suggestions could be elaborated further, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'curriculum learning') are used without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to addressing the 'actions gap' in foundation models through self-supervised generation of action-conditioned data. The integration of multiple components—diverse simulated environments, language-conditioned exploration, data filtering, and iterative bootstrapping—into a cohesive framework represents an innovative contribution. The use of contrastive learning to align observations, language descriptions, and actions in a shared embedding space is a creative application of this technique to the action prediction domain. However, many of the individual components build upon existing methods in reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and contrastive learning rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The iterative bootstrapping process, while valuable, resembles existing curriculum learning approaches. The proposal's novelty lies more in the integration and application of these techniques to address the specific challenge of incorporating action understanding into foundation models rather than in developing entirely new methodological approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The methodology is grounded in established techniques from machine learning, including contrastive learning, behavior cloning, and dynamics prediction. The mathematical formulations for the learning objectives are correctly specified and appropriate for the tasks. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined evaluation metrics that align with the research goals. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes mechanisms to address them, such as the filtering strategies for ensuring data quality. The iterative bootstrapping process is well-justified as a means to gradually increase task complexity. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from more rigorous treatment: (1) the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the iterative bootstrapping process are not discussed, (2) the potential for distribution shift between simulated and real environments is acknowledged but not thoroughly addressed in the methodology, and (3) the computational complexity of the approach, particularly for the data generation process, is not analyzed in detail."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with current technology and resources, though it involves significant implementation challenges. The use of existing simulated environments (AI2-THOR, Habitat, MuJoCo, etc.) is practical, as these platforms are well-established and accessible. The model architecture builds upon existing foundation models, which is a reasonable approach given the availability of pretrained models. The data collection and filtering pipeline is implementable with current techniques. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) generating diverse, high-quality action-conditioned data at scale across multiple environments will require substantial computational resources, (2) the iterative bootstrapping process may face challenges with error accumulation and policy degradation over iterations, (3) the sim-to-real transfer experiments will encounter the well-known reality gap that has proven challenging in robotics research, and (4) the integration of multiple complex components (exploration, filtering, multi-objective training) increases the risk of implementation issues. While these challenges do not render the proposal infeasible, they do suggest that significant engineering effort and computational resources will be required for successful implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical limitation in current foundation models—their inability to effectively perform sequential decision-making tasks due to the lack of action-conditioned data in their training. This is a fundamental challenge that, if solved, would significantly expand the applicability of foundation models to real-world control and decision-making scenarios. The potential impact spans multiple domains, including robotics, autonomous systems, interactive AI, accessibility technologies, and educational simulators. The proposed approach could lead to more sample-efficient and generalizable learning of policies, addressing key limitations of traditional reinforcement learning methods. The creation of large-scale action-conditioned datasets would benefit the broader research community, potentially accelerating progress in this area. The methodological innovations in self-supervised learning for sequential decision-making could influence research beyond the specific application domain. Overall, the proposal targets a high-impact problem with far-reaching implications for both foundation models and decision-making systems."
