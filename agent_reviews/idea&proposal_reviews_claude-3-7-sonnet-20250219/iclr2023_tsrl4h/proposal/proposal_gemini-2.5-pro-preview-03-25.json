    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on time series representation learning for health, particularly tackling the challenges of labeling constraints, missing values, irregularity, and interpretability in clinical time series data. The proposal specifically targets pediatric ICU data, which aligns with the workshop's emphasis on minority data groups. The three-component Clin-ACT framework (imputation-aware contrastive learning, uncertainty-diversity active learning, and prototype-based interpretability) directly implements the core ideas outlined in the research idea, including the target of reducing labels by 60% and improving sepsis detection by 12%. The methodology also builds upon and extends the approaches discussed in the literature review, particularly drawing from SLAC-Time's handling of missing values, STraTS's transformer architecture for irregular sampling, and incorporating multi-modal contrastive learning concepts similar to those in Baldenweg et al.'s work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the context, challenges, and significance of the research. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the three main components of the Clin-ACT framework, including mathematical formulations for the contrastive loss and acquisition functions. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are comprehensively described. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated. The only minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more specific details on the prototype visualization process and how exactly the clinical archetypes will be derived and validated, (2) clearer explanation of how the active learning component integrates with the contrastive learning process (whether they operate sequentially or in parallel), and (3) more concrete details on the implementation of the clinician study for interpretability evaluation (e.g., specific case selection criteria, detailed questionnaire design)."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty through its integration of three components that are not typically combined in clinical time series analysis: imputation-aware contrastive learning, active learning for time series, and prototype-based interpretability. While each individual component builds on existing methods (e.g., contrastive learning, uncertainty-diversity sampling, prototypical networks), their synergistic combination for pediatric ICU time series is novel. The imputation-aware augmentations specifically designed for clinical time series (sub-sampling/temporal jitter, variable masking, observation masking, Gaussian noise) represent a fresh approach to handling missingness and irregularity without explicit imputation. However, the proposal does not introduce fundamentally new algorithmic innovations in any of the three components, instead adapting and combining existing techniques in a thoughtful way for the specific clinical context. The prototype-based interpretability approach, while valuable, follows established methods from other domains."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness. The contrastive learning framework is well-formulated with appropriate mathematical details for the InfoNCE loss. The active learning acquisition function combining uncertainty and diversity is theoretically well-grounded. The prototype-based interpretability approach builds on established methods like Prototypical Networks. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, evaluation protocols, and metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and provides alternative approaches (e.g., two options for prototype learning). The validation plan includes both quantitative performance metrics and qualitative clinician feedback, which strengthens the evaluation methodology. The only minor concerns are: (1) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, (2) more detailed justification for the specific hyperparameter choices (e.g., number of prototypes K, batch size B for active learning), and (3) clearer explanation of how the three components will be optimized together (potential conflicts between optimization objectives)."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The use of publicly available datasets like MIMIC-IV's pediatric subset provides a realistic data source. The transformer-based architecture and contrastive learning approach have been successfully implemented in prior work. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The active learning component requires simulating clinician feedback, which may not perfectly reflect real-world clinical annotation processes; (2) The clinician study with 3-5 pediatric intensivists may be challenging to recruit and coordinate; (3) The computational requirements for training transformer models on large time series datasets could be substantial; (4) The integration of the three components (contrastive learning, active learning, and prototype interpretation) into a cohesive framework may be more complex than anticipated; (5) The proposal aims for a 60% reduction in labels and 12% improvement in performance metrics, which are ambitious targets that may not be fully achievable. Despite these challenges, the methodological approach is sound, and even partial success would represent a valuable contribution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need in healthcare ML: developing label-efficient, robust, and interpretable representations for pediatric ICU time series data. The significance is high for several reasons: (1) It directly tackles the pervasive problem of label scarcity in clinical settings, particularly for pediatric patients who represent an underserved population; (2) The focus on interpretability through prototypes and saliency maps addresses a major barrier to clinical adoption of ML; (3) The approach to handling missing data and irregularity without imputation is particularly valuable for clinical time series; (4) The application to sepsis prediction represents a high-impact clinical use case where early detection can significantly improve outcomes; (5) The methodology could generalize to other clinical time series applications beyond pediatric ICU. The proposal aligns perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on actionable research for minority data groups and addresses multiple key challenges identified in the task description. If successful, this work could substantially advance the practical application of time series representation learning in critical care settings."
