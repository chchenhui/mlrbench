        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles. It directly addresses the challenge of operationalizing the 'right to explanation' requirement from regulations like GDPR, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposed auditing framework specifically targets the evaluation of ML models for regulatory compliance, which is a central theme of the workshop. The idea also acknowledges the tension between technical capabilities and regulatory requirements, another key workshop focus. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address potential tensions between different regulatory principles (e.g., explainability vs. privacy), though this could be incorporated into the framework."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, approach, and expected outcomes. The three-part methodology (quantitative metrics, user study protocols, and standardized scoring) provides a concrete structure for the proposed framework. The key evaluation criteria (fidelity, intelligibility, and actionability) are clearly defined. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as how the technical metrics and human evaluation components will be weighted and integrated in the final scoring system, and what specific quantitative metrics will be used to assess fidelity and stability. The practical implementation details of the auditing process could also be more precisely defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers a fresh approach by bridging the gap between legal requirements and technical implementations of explainability. While explanation methods like LIME and SHAP exist, the novelty lies in creating a standardized auditing framework specifically designed to verify compliance with legal standards. The combination of technical metrics with human evaluation for regulatory purposes is innovative. However, the core components (explanation evaluation metrics and user studies) build upon existing research rather than introducing fundamentally new technical approaches. The innovation is more in the integration and application to the regulatory context than in developing entirely new explanation methods or evaluation techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research is highly feasible with current technology and methodologies. Explanation methods already exist, and the framework focuses on evaluating them rather than developing entirely new explanation techniques. User studies are a well-established methodology, and quantitative metrics for evaluating explanations have precedents in the literature. The semi-automated approach is practical, acknowledging that full automation of regulatory compliance is unrealistic. The main implementation challenges would be in standardizing the evaluation across different types of ML models and applications, ensuring the user studies capture diverse perspectives, and creating metrics that genuinely reflect legal standards. These challenges are substantial but manageable with appropriate expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical gap between regulatory requirements and technical implementations that has significant real-world implications. As ML systems become more prevalent in high-stakes decision-making, ensuring they comply with legal requirements for explainability is increasingly important. The proposed framework could become a standard tool for regulators, organizations, and auditors, potentially influencing how ML systems are developed and deployed across industries. It could help prevent legal challenges, protect individual rights, and build public trust in algorithmic systems. The impact extends beyond academic contributions to practical applications in regulatory compliance, corporate governance, and public policy."
