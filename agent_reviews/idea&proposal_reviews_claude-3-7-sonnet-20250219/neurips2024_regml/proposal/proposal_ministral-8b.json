    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles, particularly the tensions between different desiderata like fairness, privacy, and explainability. The proposal follows through on all three components outlined in the research idea: (1) causal graph modeling, (2) multi-objective adversarial training, and (3) regulatory stress-test benchmarking. It also builds upon the literature review by incorporating causal approaches to balance multiple competing objectives, as suggested in the first reference, and addresses the interdependencies among regulatory principles identified as a key challenge. The methodology section provides detailed algorithms and mathematical formulations that are consistent with the proposed approach."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context, the methodology section provides detailed algorithms and mathematical formulations for each component, and the expected outcomes and impact are well-defined. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the significance of the work is clearly explained. The causal framework, multi-objective adversarial training, and regulatory stress-test benchmark are all described with sufficient detail. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as how the causal graphs will be validated and how conflicts between regulatory principles will be resolved when they are detected. Additionally, while the mathematical formulations are provided, some of the notation could be more precisely defined to avoid ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a unified causal framework that addresses multiple regulatory principles simultaneously, rather than in isolation. The integration of causal modeling with multi-objective adversarial training to jointly enforce compliance with fairness, privacy, and explainability is a fresh approach that extends beyond existing work. The regulatory stress-test benchmark is also an innovative contribution that could provide valuable insights into the trade-offs between different regulatory principles. However, while the individual components (causal modeling, adversarial training) are not entirely new, the novelty lies in their combination and application to regulatory compliance. The proposal builds upon existing literature rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts, which is appropriate but limits its novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a solid theoretical basis in causal inference and multi-objective optimization. The methodology is rigorous, with detailed algorithms and mathematical formulations for each component. The use of causal graphs to model relationships between data features, model decisions, and regulatory violations is well-justified, as is the multi-objective adversarial training approach. The evaluation metrics for each regulatory principle are appropriate and comprehensive. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further justification or elaboration. For instance, the proposal does not fully address the challenges of causal discovery in high-dimensional spaces or the potential limitations of the proposed methods. Additionally, while the mathematical formulations are provided, some assumptions and constraints could be more explicitly stated to ensure the approach's validity across different contexts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan, but with several implementation challenges. Causal discovery in complex, high-dimensional datasets is notoriously difficult and often requires domain expertise or strong assumptions. The multi-objective adversarial training approach, while theoretically sound, may face optimization difficulties when balancing competing objectives. Creating a comprehensive regulatory stress-test benchmark across multiple domains will require significant resources and expertise. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but does not provide detailed strategies for addressing them. Additionally, the timeline for completing all three components (causal modeling, adversarial training, and benchmarking) is not specified, making it difficult to assess the project's temporal feasibility. While the individual components are implementable with current technology and methods, the integration and joint optimization across multiple regulatory principles present substantial challenges that may require considerable refinement and development."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the field of regulatable ML by developing a framework that harmonizes multiple regulatory principles rather than treating them in isolation. This approach has the potential to significantly impact how ML systems are designed, evaluated, and deployed in high-stakes domains requiring regulatory compliance. The outcomes could provide valuable tools for auditing ML systems under multi-axis regulatory constraints and enable the development of more ethical, transparent, and responsible AI systems. The regulatory stress-test benchmark could become a standard for evaluating ML systems' compliance with multiple regulatory principles. The research also contributes to the broader understanding of causality in ML, which has implications beyond regulatory compliance. The significance is particularly high given the increasing regulatory scrutiny of AI systems worldwide and the growing need for methods that can ensure holistic compliance with diverse regulatory frameworks."
