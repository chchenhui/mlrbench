    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles, particularly the tensions between different desiderata like fairness, privacy, and explainability. The proposal follows through on all aspects of the original idea, developing a causal framework for disentanglement, multi-objective adversarial training, and a regulatory stress-test benchmark. It builds upon the literature review by extending the causal approaches mentioned in Binkyte et al. and Ji et al., while incorporating adversarial techniques similar to Lahoti et al. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges with foundation models, the proposal doesn't explicitly address large language models or generative AI applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with logical progression from motivation to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is detailed with mathematical formulations. The methodology section provides concrete algorithmic steps, loss functions, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for constructing counterfactuals in the adversarial training could be more precisely defined; (2) The explanation of the privacy adversarial loss function appears to have the same terms in both parts of the equation, which is confusing; (3) The relationship between the causal graph construction and the adversarial training could be more explicitly connected to show how the identified regulation-violating paths inform the training process."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of causal modeling with multi-objective adversarial training to jointly optimize for fairness, privacy, and explainability is an innovative approach not fully explored in existing literature. While individual components (causal fairness, adversarial training) have precedents, their combination and application to regulatory harmony is original. The proposed regulatory stress-test benchmark would be a novel contribution to the field, allowing systematic evaluation of trade-offs. The proposal extends beyond prior work by providing a unified framework rather than addressing regulatory principles in isolation. However, it builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms, which slightly limits its novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations in causal inference and adversarial learning. The mathematical formulations for the loss functions and overall objective are well-defined, and the experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics. However, there are some concerns: (1) The privacy adversarial loss function appears to have an error in its formulation; (2) The proposal assumes that causal graphs can be accurately constructed with expert knowledge and data-driven refinement, but doesn't fully address the challenges of causal discovery in high-dimensional spaces with limited data; (3) The trade-off between the multiple objectives in the min-max formulation may lead to optimization difficulties that aren't fully addressed; (4) The explanation of how the oracle explanations E*(x,a) are obtained is missing, which is crucial for the explainability component."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially feasible research agenda. The implementation of multi-objective adversarial training with three separate discriminators is technically complex but achievable with current deep learning frameworks. The datasets mentioned (COMPAS, UCI Adult, MIMIC-III) are publicly available. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) Accurate causal discovery in real-world datasets with unobserved confounders is notoriously difficult; (2) The optimization of competing objectives may lead to convergence issues or unstable training dynamics; (3) The computational resources required for the proposed grid search over hyperparameters {α,β,γ,δ} with 5-fold cross-validation could be substantial; (4) Creating synthetic data with controlled causal effects that realistically model regulatory violations requires careful design; (5) The ambitious goal of reducing discrimination metrics by ≥30% while maintaining privacy (ε≤1) and explanation fidelity (≥90%) may be difficult to achieve simultaneously."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current ML research and practice with high potential impact. As regulatory frameworks increasingly demand holistic compliance across multiple principles, a unified approach to fairness, privacy, and explainability is extremely valuable. The expected outcomes would provide both theoretical insights and practical tools for auditing and remediating ML models before deployment in regulated sectors. The regulatory stress-test benchmark would enable systematic evaluation of trade-offs, benefiting both researchers and practitioners. The work could significantly influence how ML systems are developed and evaluated in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, potentially setting new standards for regulatory compliance. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging the gap between ML research and regulatory policies."
