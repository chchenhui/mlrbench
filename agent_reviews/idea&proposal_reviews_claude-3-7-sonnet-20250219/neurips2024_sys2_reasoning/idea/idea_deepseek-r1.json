    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on System-2 reasoning in language models. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the task description: it proposes a specific mechanism for implementing System-2 reasoning (hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture), discusses where this system should be implemented (partly inside the model and partly in an engineered external system), addresses benchmarking challenges (focusing on compositional tasks with synthetic datasets to avoid contamination), and considers the implications for AI safety through verifiable decision-making. The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively discuss whether scale alone could achieve similar results (the 'bitter lesson' question), though it does imply that a hybrid approach is necessary beyond pure scaling."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (LMs' struggle with System-2 reasoning), proposes a specific solution (hybrid architecture with symbolic representations), and outlines concrete examples (e.g., math problem-solving with equation steps). The methodology is well-defined: using reinforcement learning to train the LM to produce valid symbolic outputs that can be processed by external symbolic engines. The evaluation approach is also specified. The only minor ambiguities are in the details of implementation - exactly how the symbolic representations would be structured across different domains, and how the reinforcement learning feedback loop would be designed in practice. These are reasonable gaps for a research proposal, but prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows good novelty in its specific approach to combining neural and symbolic methods. While neuro-symbolic AI itself is not new, the specific framework of having LMs generate intermediate symbolic representations that are then processed by external symbolic engines represents a fresh perspective. The reinforcement learning approach to training the LM to produce syntactically valid symbolic outputs is also innovative. However, similar concepts have been explored in various forms (e.g., neural theorem provers, neural-symbolic VQA systems, and chain-of-thought prompting with verification), which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score. The proposal builds upon existing work rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking paradigm, but does so in a thoughtful way that could advance the field."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The components required (transformer-based LMs, symbolic reasoning engines, reinforcement learning) all exist and have been well-studied. The approach of generating intermediate symbolic representations is implementable, as demonstrated by related work in program synthesis and formal reasoning. However, there are moderate challenges that prevent a higher feasibility score: (1) designing effective reinforcement learning signals for complex reasoning tasks, (2) ensuring the LM can consistently generate syntactically valid symbolic forms, (3) creating appropriate synthetic datasets that test generalization without contamination, and (4) integrating the neural and symbolic components efficiently. These challenges are substantial but not insurmountable, making the overall feasibility good but not excellent."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical limitation in current AI systems - the lack of reliable System-2 reasoning capabilities. If successful, this approach could have significant impact across multiple domains requiring structured problem-solving, including mathematics, logic, planning, and safety-critical applications. The potential for improved out-of-distribution generalization and interpretable reasoning traces directly addresses major concerns in the field. The significance is particularly high given the growing recognition that pure neural approaches may have fundamental limitations for systematic reasoning. The proposal could bridge the gap between neural flexibility and symbolic rigor, potentially influencing the direction of AI research. It doesn't receive a perfect score only because similar hybrid approaches have been proposed before, though this specific implementation could still advance the state of the art substantially."
