        "justification": "The SyncheGen idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on System-2 reasoning at scale. It directly addresses one of the explicit topics: 'How do we benchmark System-2-like generalization? How do we avoid data contamination?' The proposal offers a concrete methodology for creating contamination-free benchmarks through grammar-guided generation with strict data separation. It also touches on other workshop topics by exploring what mechanisms might be needed for System-2 reasoning (comparing transformer variants) and whether different training methods (chain-of-thought, curriculum learning) can enhance these capabilities. The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively discuss whether System-2 capabilities are necessary or address the 'bitter lesson' question, though these are somewhat implicit in the motivation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, methodology, and evaluation plans. The concept of using domain-specific formal grammars to generate datasets with strict train-test splits is explained concisely. The example of training on 'simple arithmetic' and testing on nested expressions effectively illustrates the approach. The evaluation metrics (accuracy, attention-path consistency, transfer to downstream tasks) are specified. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration - for instance, how exactly 'attention-path consistency' would be measured, or what specific 'hybrid symbolic-attention' architectures would be tested. The proposal is clear enough to understand the general approach but leaves some implementation specifics undefined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality in its systematic approach to benchmark creation. While procedural generation of datasets isn't new, the specific focus on grammar-guided generation with strict atomic component separation between train and test sets offers a fresh perspective on contamination-free evaluation. The attention to measuring not just accuracy but also attention-path consistency for symbolic rules is an innovative evaluation approach. However, the core techniques (formal grammars, procedural generation) build upon established methods rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The novelty lies more in the rigorous application and combination of these techniques to address the specific challenge of System-2 reasoning evaluation rather than in creating entirely new methodological approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Formal grammars are well-established tools for generating structured data, and the approach of creating train-test splits based on atomic components is technically straightforward to implement. The evaluation metrics mentioned (accuracy, attention-path consistency) are measurable with existing techniques. The comparison of different transformer variants and training strategies is also practical with current resources. The main implementation challenges would likely be in ensuring true data separation (verifying that test examples genuinely require compositional generalization) and in developing robust domain-specific grammars for diverse reasoning tasks. However, these challenges appear manageable and don't significantly impact the overall feasibility of the project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI evaluation: distinguishing true reasoning capabilities from memorization or statistical pattern matching. The significance is high because reliable, contamination-free benchmarks are essential for measuring progress in System-2 reasoning - a capability increasingly recognized as important for robust AI systems. By providing a methodology that ensures test examples require genuine compositional generalization, the research could substantially advance our understanding of which architectures and training methods truly support reasoning rather than pattern matching. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in symbolic mathematics, program synthesis, and planning, where compositional reasoning is crucial. The blueprint for contamination-free evaluation could influence benchmark design across the field."
