    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on System-2 reasoning in transformer models and tackles key questions about implementation approaches, benchmarking, and alternatives to pure scaling. The proposed 'Reflection Layers' and self-supervised framework align perfectly with the original idea of developing inherent reasoning capabilities within the model architecture rather than as external components. The proposal incorporates concepts from the literature review, including self-supervised learning, curriculum learning (Johnson & Williams, 2023), contrastive learning (Chen & Lee, 2023), and meta-learning (Brown & Green, 2023). It also addresses the challenge of data contamination through procedural benchmarks (White & Black, 2024). The only minor inconsistency is that some referenced papers appear to be hypothetical (with future dates), though their concepts are used appropriately."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The technical details of the Reflection Layers and training methodology are explained thoroughly with mathematical formulations. The experimental design is comprehensive, including baselines, datasets, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. The proposal effectively communicates complex ideas about meta-cognition and self-supervised learning frameworks. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism by which the Reflection Layers' outputs influence subsequent processing could be more precisely defined, (2) the implementation details of the rule adherence loss could be more concrete with specific examples, and (3) the relationship between the various loss components could be further elaborated to explain potential interactions or conflicts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. The concept of 'Reflection Layers' as an architectural modification to enable meta-cognitive capabilities within transformers is innovative and distinct from existing approaches. Unlike external reasoning frameworks (like System 2 Attention or Tree-of-Thoughts), this approach aims to develop inherent reasoning capabilities within the model architecture itself. The multi-faceted self-supervised training strategy combining contrastive learning, rule adherence rewards, and curriculum learning for reasoning is also novel. The proposal differentiates itself from prior work by focusing on emergent reasoning rather than grafted capabilities or explicit mode switching (as in Dualformer). While it builds upon existing concepts like meta-learning and contrastive learning, it applies them in a new context and combination specifically for System-2 reasoning. The novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that some components (like curriculum learning and contrastive objectives) are adaptations of existing techniques, but their integration and application to this specific problem represent a fresh approach."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in its theoretical approach. It builds upon established transformer architectures and incorporates well-understood training techniques like contrastive learning and curriculum learning. The mathematical formulations for the various loss functions are technically correct and appropriate for the stated goals. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics to test the hypotheses. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) The mechanism by which the Reflection Layers actually influence subsequent processing is somewhat underspecified, with multiple options presented but no clear justification for which would be most effective; (2) The rule adherence loss relies on the ability to automatically check the correctness of reasoning steps, which may be challenging to implement robustly across diverse reasoning domains; (3) There is limited discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach; (4) The proposal could benefit from more detailed analysis of computational complexity and scalability concerns. While the overall approach is sound, these gaps in technical specification slightly reduce the score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan, though with several significant challenges. On the positive side, the architectural modifications (Reflection Layers) can be implemented within existing transformer frameworks, and the training methodology builds on established techniques. The experimental design is reasonable, with appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Generating high-quality procedural datasets with correct and incorrect reasoning traces at scale may be labor-intensive and challenging to automate; (2) The rule adherence loss requires automated verification of reasoning steps, which is difficult to implement robustly across diverse reasoning domains; (3) The combined loss function with multiple components may be difficult to balance and optimize, potentially leading to training instabilities; (4) The computational resources required for training models with additional Reflection Layers, especially at larger scales, could be substantial; (5) The proposal aims to train models from 100M to 1B parameters, which may be insufficient to demonstrate the full potential of the approach compared to larger models. While the research is implementable, these challenges suggest a moderate rather than high feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI research: developing robust System-2 reasoning capabilities in neural networks. This is highly significant for several reasons: (1) It directly tackles fundamental limitations of current LLMs in logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and maintaining factual consistency; (2) It proposes an alternative to pure scaling approaches, potentially offering a more efficient path to enhanced reasoning; (3) If successful, it could significantly improve AI reliability and trustworthiness in high-stakes applications; (4) The approach of developing inherent reasoning capabilities rather than external augmentations could influence future model architectures; (5) It directly addresses key questions posed by the workshop regarding implementation approaches for System-2 reasoning. The significance is somewhat limited by the relatively modest scale of the proposed models (up to 1B parameters), which may not fully demonstrate the approach's potential impact on state-of-the-art systems. Nevertheless, the conceptual contribution and potential to influence future research directions make this proposal highly significant."
