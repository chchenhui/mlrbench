    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on System-2 reasoning in transformer models and tackles key questions like how to imbue language models with reasoning capabilities, whether it should emerge from training or be explicitly engineered, and how to benchmark generalization while avoiding data contamination. The proposal's Reflection-Integrated Transformer (Refl-T) approach is consistent with the research idea of developing self-supervised frameworks for emergent System-2 capabilities. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with explicit references to System 2 Attention (Weston & Sukhbaatar, 2023), Dualformer (Su et al., 2024), curriculum learning (Johnson & Williams, 2023), and contrastive frameworks (Chen & Lee, 2024). The proposal builds upon these works while addressing their limitations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with detailed explanations of the model architecture, training objectives, and experimental design. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, making the technical approach easy to follow. The Reflection Layer mechanism is explained thoroughly with appropriate equations. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism by which the correction vector δt influences the next token prediction could be elaborated further, (2) the relationship between the reflection consistency score ct and the reinforcement reward rt could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some details about the procedural task generation could be more specific. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing the Reflection Layer concept, which enables transformers to meta-evaluate their own reasoning steps. This approach differs from existing work like System 2 Attention and Dualformer by focusing on internal self-evaluation rather than external regeneration or dual processing modes. The combination of multiple training objectives (language modeling, consistency, contrastive, and reinforcement learning) into a unified framework is also innovative. However, several individual components draw heavily from existing literature: the curriculum learning approach builds directly on Johnson & Williams (2023), the contrastive framework echoes Chen & Lee (2024), and the meta-learning aspects relate to Brown & Green (2023). While the integration of these approaches is novel, the proposal doesn't introduce fundamentally new paradigms but rather combines and extends existing techniques in a thoughtful way."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and soundness. The mathematical formulations for the Reflection Layers and various loss functions are well-defined and theoretically grounded. The training methodology combines established techniques (curriculum learning, contrastive learning, reinforcement learning) in a principled manner. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and systematic ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components. The approach to preventing data contamination through proceduralized task generation with randomized parameters and novel vocabulary tokens is methodologically sound. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations. One minor concern is that the reinforcement learning component could benefit from more theoretical justification regarding how the reward signals align with logical consistency. Overall, the approach is well-founded in established machine learning principles while extending them in reasonable ways."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. The core architectural modifications (Reflection Layers) are well-defined and can be implemented within existing transformer frameworks. The training methodology, while complex with multiple loss components, uses established techniques that have been demonstrated in prior work. The computational requirements (64 A100 GPUs, 100B tokens) are substantial but within the range of modern research projects. However, several aspects present feasibility challenges: (1) designing effective procedural task generators that avoid data contamination while providing meaningful reasoning challenges is non-trivial, (2) balancing the multiple loss terms (λ1, λ2, λ3) may require extensive hyperparameter tuning, (3) the reinforcement learning component might face stability issues when combined with other objectives, and (4) the expected 20 percentage point improvement over baselines is ambitious. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and methods, though it will require significant engineering effort and computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI systems: the lack of reliable System-2 reasoning capabilities. If successful, the Refl-T approach could significantly advance the field by demonstrating that transformer architectures can develop emergent reasoning abilities through self-supervised learning, without requiring external symbolic systems. This would have important implications for AI safety, trustworthiness, and applicability in high-stakes domains like medicine, law, and scientific discovery. The proposed benchmarking methodology also contributes valuable tools for evaluating reasoning capabilities while controlling for data contamination. The impact extends beyond the specific model to broader questions about how to achieve System-2 reasoning in neural networks. While the proposal may not completely solve the reasoning gap, it represents a substantial step forward that could influence future research directions and practical applications. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of reliable reasoning for deploying AI in critical domains."
