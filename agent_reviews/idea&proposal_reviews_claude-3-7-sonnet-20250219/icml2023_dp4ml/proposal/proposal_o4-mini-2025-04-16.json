    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on duality principles in modern machine learning, particularly for model explanation and interpretation. The proposal leverages Lagrange duality to measure sensitivity of perturbations for model explanation, which is explicitly mentioned as an underexploited area in the task description. The methodology is consistent with the research idea of framing feature importance as a constrained optimization problem and using Lagrange multipliers to quantify feature influence. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with references to recent works on sensitivity analysis (Wang et al. 2024, Pizarroso et al. 2023), topological interpretability (Spannaus et al. 2023), and physics-informed dual frameworks (Hwang & Son 2021). The proposal clearly identifies the gap in existing literature regarding the application of Lagrange duality for feature importance in deep networks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The mathematical formulation is precise, with well-defined notation and step-by-step derivation of the Lagrange dual problem. The algorithmic steps are explicitly outlined, making implementation straightforward. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) The relationship between the local linearization approximation and the accuracy of the resulting explanations could be more thoroughly discussed, (2) The iterative refinement process in step 7 of the algorithm could be elaborated further to explain how it captures nonlinearity, and (3) The proposal could more explicitly address how the method handles the inherent non-convexity of neural networks beyond the local linearization approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to neural network interpretability by leveraging Lagrange duality theory in a way that hasn't been fully explored in the literature. While sensitivity analysis and interpretability methods exist (as noted in the literature review), the specific formulation of feature importance as a constrained perturbation problem with Lagrange dual variables serving as certificates is innovative. The proposal bridges classical convex optimization theory with modern deep learning interpretability in a unique way. The approach differs from existing gradient-based or perturbation-based methods by providing theoretical guarantees through duality principles. The novelty is particularly evident in the extraction of feature importance directly from dual variables and the formulation of the QP solver embedded within modern deep learning frameworks. However, the local linearization technique is somewhat standard in making non-convex problems tractable, which slightly reduces the novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound with a well-formulated mathematical framework based on established principles of Lagrange duality. The derivation of the dual problem is correct, and the connection between dual variables and feature importance is well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics to validate the approach. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) The local linearization approximation may not hold for highly nonlinear regions of the neural network, potentially affecting the accuracy of explanations, (2) While the proposal mentions an iterative refinement process to capture nonlinearity, it doesn't provide theoretical guarantees on convergence or bounds on approximation error, (3) The proposal doesn't fully address how the method handles adversarial examples that might exploit the linearization assumption, and (4) The relationship between the dual certificates and actual feature importance could benefit from more rigorous justification beyond the intuitive connection."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current technology and resources. It leverages existing deep learning frameworks (PyTorch) and QP solvers (qpth, OSQP) that are readily available. The computational complexity analysis shows that the method is efficient for moderate numbers of classes, making it practical for real-world applications. The experimental design is realistic and well-structured, with clearly defined datasets, models, and evaluation metrics. The batching approach to amortize solver overhead is a practical consideration that enhances feasibility. However, there are some potential challenges: (1) Scaling to very high-dimensional inputs (e.g., high-resolution images) might be computationally intensive due to the gradient computations for each class, (2) The QP solver's efficiency for large batch sizes needs to be verified in practice, and (3) The iterative refinement process to capture nonlinearity might increase computational cost significantly depending on the number of iterations required."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important gap in the field of interpretable machine learning by providing theoretically grounded explanations with provable guarantees. This is particularly valuable in high-stakes domains requiring certified interpretability, such as healthcare and autonomous systems. The approach has the potential to significantly impact how we understand and trust deep neural networks by providing more reliable and robust explanations than existing methods. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications in safe AI, robust training regimes, and reinforcement learning. The connection between classical convex duality and modern deep learning opens new research directions and could revitalize interest in duality principles for nonconvex models. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on classification tasks, and the proposal could have explored more diverse applications such as regression, generative models, or reinforcement learning in greater detail."
