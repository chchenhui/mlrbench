    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the ICML Duality Principles workshop's call for leveraging duality concepts in model understanding and explanation, specifically focusing on Lagrange duality for sensitivity analysis in deep learning. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the core idea of using Lagrange duality to quantify feature importance through minimal perturbations, and it builds upon the literature review by addressing challenges like non-convexity in neural networks, computational efficiency, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. The mathematical formulation is consistent with optimization principles mentioned in both the task description and literature review. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions potential extensions to other duality concepts (like Fenchel duality), it primarily focuses on Lagrange duality."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research problem, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The mathematical formulation is precise and well-explained, with appropriate notation and step-by-step derivations that make the approach understandable. The algorithm is presented in a logical sequence with clear implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the dual variables and feature importance could be more explicitly defined earlier in the proposal; (2) The transition between the mathematical formulation and the practical algorithm implementation contains some complexity that might be challenging for readers without strong optimization backgrounds; (3) Some of the evaluation metrics, particularly for robustness, could be more precisely defined with specific formulas or procedures."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to explainable AI by systematically applying Lagrange duality principles to deep neural network interpretation. While duality concepts are well-established in optimization theory and some applications exist in specific domains (as noted in the literature review with Hwang & Son's work on kinetic equations), the systematic application of Lagrangian duality for generating feature attributions in general deep learning models is indeed innovative. The proposal introduces several novel elements: (1) Formulating feature importance as a constrained optimization problem seeking minimal perturbations; (2) Deriving sensitivity scores from optimal Lagrange multipliers; (3) Developing an efficient dual ascent algorithm specifically tailored for neural network explanations. The approach bridges classical optimization theory with modern deep learning interpretability needs in a way that hasn't been thoroughly explored. However, some components of the methodology, such as perturbation-based approaches to explanations, build upon existing concepts in the XAI literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and demonstrates strong theoretical foundations in optimization theory, particularly Lagrangian duality. The mathematical formulation is rigorous and correctly applies duality principles. The proposed algorithm for solving the dual problem via backpropagation is technically feasible and well-grounded. However, there are some limitations to its soundness: (1) The non-convexity of neural networks poses significant challenges for duality theory, and while the proposal acknowledges this issue, the solutions offered (focusing on local convexity, finding stationary points) may not fully address the theoretical gaps; (2) The proposal assumes that local sensitivity provides meaningful interpretability, but this assumption may not hold for all network architectures or decision boundaries; (3) The connection between the optimal dual variables and feature importance, while intuitive, would benefit from more formal theoretical guarantees or bounds; (4) Some of the evaluation metrics, particularly for faithfulness, may not perfectly align with the theoretical foundations of the method."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach that can be implemented using existing deep learning frameworks and optimization techniques. The algorithmic implementation via dual ascent and backpropagation is practical and can leverage automatic differentiation capabilities in frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate datasets, models, and baseline methods. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) The computational cost of solving the dual optimization problem for each explanation may be significant, especially for large networks or high-dimensional inputs; (2) The convergence of the dual ascent algorithm in non-convex settings is not guaranteed, potentially requiring careful tuning of hyperparameters or more sophisticated optimization techniques; (3) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenges of non-convexity in neural networks, which may limit the method's applicability to certain architectures or decision boundaries; (4) The evaluation on large-scale models like Vision Transformers is mentioned as conditional on computational resources, indicating potential scalability concerns."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant gap in the field of explainable AI by providing a theoretically grounded approach to feature attribution based on optimization duality. Its significance stems from several factors: (1) It directly addresses the call from the ICML workshop to revitalize interest in duality principles for modern machine learning; (2) It offers potential improvements in explanation faithfulness and robustness compared to existing methods, which could enhance trust in AI systems; (3) It bridges the gap between classical optimization theory and modern deep learning practice; (4) The framework could provide insights into model robustness against adversarial attacks, a critical challenge in deploying AI systems. The potential impact extends beyond just creating another XAI method â€“ it could establish a new theoretical foundation for understanding neural network decision boundaries through the lens of sensitivity analysis. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on post-hoc explanations rather than incorporating interpretability into the model design itself, and by potential computational limitations for real-time applications."
