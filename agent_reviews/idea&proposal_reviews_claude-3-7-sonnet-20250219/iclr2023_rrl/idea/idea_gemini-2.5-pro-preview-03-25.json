    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Adaptive Policy Distillation (APD) idea aligns excellently with the task description of 'Reincarnating RL'. It directly addresses the core concept of reusing prior computation in RL by proposing a framework to leverage multiple suboptimal policies. The idea specifically tackles the challenge of 'dealing with suboptimality of prior computational work' which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. It also addresses 'algorithmic decisions and challenges associated with suboptimality' by proposing a competence estimation mechanism. The approach is focused on 'learned policies' as the form of prior computation, which is listed as one of the key areas of interest. The only minor limitation in alignment is that it doesn't explicitly discuss evaluation protocols or benchmarks, though it does mention expected outcomes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (leveraging multiple suboptimal policies), proposes a specific solution (adaptive weighting based on competence estimation), and outlines the expected benefits. The core mechanism of estimating teacher competence in different regions and then dynamically weighting the distillation loss is well-explained. However, there are some minor ambiguities: the exact method for estimating competence is not fully specified (mentions 'offline evaluation metrics or limited online interaction' but doesn't detail these), and the implementation details of the dynamic weighting mechanism could be more precise. These minor gaps prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score, but overall, the idea is presented with strong clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to policy distillation. While policy distillation itself is not new, the adaptive component that dynamically weights multiple teachers based on state-dependent competence estimation represents a fresh perspective. The concept of region-specific competence assessment for teachers is particularly innovative. However, the idea builds upon existing concepts in policy distillation, ensemble methods, and teacher-student frameworks rather than introducing a completely new paradigm. Similar approaches of weighted distillation or selective learning have been explored in other contexts, though perhaps not with this specific focus on reincarnating RL with multiple suboptimal teachers. The novelty lies more in the combination and application of these concepts rather than in creating entirely new methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed APD framework appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. The core components—policy distillation, competence estimation, and dynamic weighting—all have precedents in the literature and can be implemented with existing techniques. The approach doesn't require any theoretical breakthroughs or new hardware capabilities. The main implementation challenges would likely be in developing reliable competence estimation metrics and ensuring the dynamic weighting mechanism works effectively across diverse environments. The proposal acknowledges practical considerations by mentioning both offline and online fine-tuning options, showing awareness of implementation constraints. The idea could be implemented and tested with reasonable resources, making it quite feasible for researchers to pursue."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant problem in the emerging field of reincarnating RL. The ability to effectively leverage multiple suboptimal policies could substantially reduce computational requirements for complex RL problems, directly supporting the workshop's goal of democratizing RL research. If successful, this approach could enable researchers with limited computational resources to build upon existing work rather than starting from scratch. The potential impact extends beyond academic settings to real-world applications where multiple imperfect policies might be available. The significance is enhanced by the fact that the approach could be applied broadly across different domains and RL algorithms. While not revolutionary in the broader AI landscape, within the specific context of reincarnating RL, this idea addresses a central challenge with potentially wide-reaching benefits."
