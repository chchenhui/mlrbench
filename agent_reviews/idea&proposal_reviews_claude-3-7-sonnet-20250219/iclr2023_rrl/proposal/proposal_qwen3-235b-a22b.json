    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of the Reincarnating RL workshop: reusing prior computation while handling suboptimal prior knowledge. The proposal's focus on retroactive policy correction via uncertainty-aware distillation perfectly matches the research idea of correcting suboptimal prior data. The methodology incorporates Q-ensemble uncertainty estimation to identify and downweight unreliable regions in prior data, exactly as outlined in the idea. The proposal also acknowledges and builds upon the literature review, addressing key challenges like handling suboptimal prior data, balancing exploration/exploitation, and uncertainty estimation. The evaluation across both discrete (Atari) and continuous (MuJoCo) domains with synthetic suboptimality injection aligns with the democratization goals mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from motivation to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for the uncertainty estimation via Q-ensemble and the policy distillation with uncertainty weighting. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The figures are referenced but not provided, which is a minor limitation. Some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the exact implementation of the offline RL algorithms (BCQ, CQL) mentioned and how they integrate with the proposed uncertainty weighting mechanism. The proposal could also more explicitly connect the methodology to the specific challenges mentioned in the literature review."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel combination of existing techniques rather than a fundamentally new approach. The core innovation lies in the uncertainty-aware distillation framework that explicitly addresses suboptimality in prior data, which is a significant contribution to the reincarnating RL paradigm. The use of Q-ensemble for uncertainty estimation is not new, but applying it specifically to identify unreliable regions in prior data for policy distillation is an innovative application. The weighting function that dynamically discounts unreliable prior knowledge is a clever mechanism that distinguishes this work from standard distillation approaches. However, the proposal builds heavily on existing offline RL methods and ensemble techniques rather than introducing entirely new algorithmic components. The benchmarking protocol with synthetic suboptimality injections is a valuable contribution but incremental in nature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The uncertainty estimation via Q-ensemble is well-grounded in statistical learning theory, and the formulation of the distillation loss with uncertainty weighting is mathematically sound. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal acknowledges limitations and potential challenges, such as computational overhead and domain shift issues. The hypotheses are reasonable and testable. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. One area that could be strengthened is the theoretical analysis of how the uncertainty weighting guarantees improvement over the prior policy - while the intuition is clear, formal guarantees or bounds on performance improvement would enhance the rigor. Additionally, more details on hyperparameter selection (e.g., how to set Î± in the weighting function) would strengthen the practical soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible approach that can be implemented with existing RL frameworks and computational resources. The two-stage framework (uncertainty estimation followed by policy distillation) is straightforward to implement, and the required components (Q-networks, policy networks, offline RL algorithms) are well-established. The experimental design with Atari and MuJoCo environments is standard in the field. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) Training Q-ensembles can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale tasks; (2) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address how to handle domain shifts between prior and target tasks; (3) The effectiveness of the uncertainty estimation depends on the quality and coverage of the prior data, which may be challenging in real-world scenarios with limited data. The ablation studies are well-designed to address some of these concerns, but the computational requirements may limit the scale of experiments possible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in reincarnating RL: handling suboptimal prior knowledge, which is essential for real-world applications where perfect priors are rare. The potential impact is substantial, as it could enable more efficient and reliable reuse of prior computation, democratizing access to complex RL problems as highlighted in the workshop description. The framework could significantly reduce the computational resources needed for iterative RL development, making advanced RL more accessible to researchers with limited resources. The safety implications are particularly important for high-stakes applications like healthcare and robotics, where propagating errors from suboptimal priors could have serious consequences. The benchmarking protocol also contributes to standardizing evaluation in reincarnating RL, addressing a gap identified in the workshop description. While the immediate impact is focused on the RL research community, the long-term implications for practical RL deployment are substantial."
