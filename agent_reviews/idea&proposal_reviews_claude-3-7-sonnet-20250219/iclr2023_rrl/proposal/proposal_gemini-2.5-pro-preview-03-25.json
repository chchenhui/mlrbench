        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of handling suboptimal prior computation in Reincarnating RL, which is explicitly mentioned as a key topic in the workshop call. The proposed Retroactive Policy Correction (RPC) framework aligns perfectly with the research idea of distilling corrected policies from suboptimal prior data using uncertainty estimates. The proposal incorporates relevant literature, citing key works like Agarwal et al. (2022) on Reincarnating RL and building upon offline RL methods like CQL and IQL. The methodology comprehensively addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly uncertainty estimation and handling suboptimal prior data."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and experimental design are presented in a logical and detailed manner. The technical formulation of the RPC framework is precise, with clear mathematical notation and explanations of key components like the uncertainty-weighted distillation loss. The two-phase approach (uncertainty estimation followed by corrective policy distillation) is well-defined. The experimental design outlines specific environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as more details on how the offline RL objective interacts with the distillation term during optimization, and potential challenges in scaling the approach to very large state spaces where uncertainty estimation might be difficult."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to addressing suboptimality in Reincarnating RL. While ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation and policy distillation are established techniques individually, their combination in the context of correcting suboptimal prior data in RL represents a fresh perspective. The uncertainty-weighted distillation mechanism is particularly innovative, providing a principled way to selectively leverage reliable parts of prior data while correcting or ignoring unreliable parts. However, the core components (ensemble Q-learning, offline RL, policy distillation) are well-established in the literature, and the proposal builds incrementally on these existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic paradigms. The novelty lies primarily in the problem formulation and the specific combination of techniques to address suboptimality in Reincarnating RL."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness. The RPC framework is built on solid theoretical foundations from offline RL, ensemble learning, and uncertainty estimation. The mathematical formulation of the uncertainty-weighted distillation loss is rigorous and well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies to isolate the contribution of different components. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, such as the need to tune hyperparameters and the potential sensitivity to ensemble size. The approach to quantifying uncertainty through ensemble disagreement is well-grounded in the literature. One minor concern is that the proposal doesn't deeply analyze potential failure modes or theoretical guarantees of the approach, particularly regarding convergence properties when the prior data is highly suboptimal."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a highly feasible research plan. It leverages existing benchmark environments (Atari, D4RL) and builds upon established offline RL algorithms (CQL, IQL). The computational requirements, while non-trivial due to the ensemble training, are reasonable and within the capabilities of academic research labs. The experimental design is practical and well-structured, with clear evaluation protocols. The proposal also includes a systematic approach to generating controlled suboptimal datasets, which is crucial for rigorous evaluation. The two-phase approach allows for modular implementation and testing. The hyperparameters and design choices (ensemble size, uncertainty weighting function) are reasonable and can be tuned through standard practices. Overall, the research plan is realistic and achievable with current resources and techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in Reincarnating RL that has significant practical implications. Successfully handling suboptimal prior computation could substantially advance the field by enabling more efficient and robust reuse of computational artifacts, democratizing access to complex RL problems, and facilitating iterative development of RL systems. The potential impact extends beyond academic research to practical applications where retraining from scratch is prohibitively expensive. The proposal directly contributes to the goals outlined in the workshop call, particularly in developing methods for accelerating RL training using prior computation and addressing challenges associated with suboptimality. While the specific technical approach (ensemble-based uncertainty estimation and weighted distillation) may have incremental rather than revolutionary impact, the problem being addressed is of high importance to the field."
