    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning. It directly addresses the core issues highlighted in the task description: the unsustainability of discarding deprecated models, the limitations of monolithic architectures, and the need for modular approaches that enable knowledge preservation. The proposed decentralized framework with specialized expert modules matches several key topics mentioned in the workshop, including Mixture-of-Experts architectures, routing of specialized experts, and applications in continual learning. The 'knowledge preservation protocol' specifically targets the workshop's concern about wasted computational resources when models are discarded. The only minor gap is that while the idea mentions a decentralized framework, it doesn't explicitly detail the collaborative training aspects that the workshop also emphasizes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated and understandable. It clearly outlines the motivation, the main components of the proposed framework (decentralized expert modules, dynamic routing, knowledge preservation protocol), and introduces an entropy-based metric for module specialization. However, there are some aspects that would benefit from further elaboration. For instance, the exact mechanism of the 'knowledge preservation protocol' is not fully specified - how exactly does it identify valuable parameters? Similarly, while the dynamic routing mechanism is mentioned, its specific implementation details are not provided. The relationship between the entropy-based metric and the routing algorithm could also be more precisely defined. These ambiguities prevent the idea from receiving a higher clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea demonstrates significant originality by combining several innovative elements. The concept of a 'knowledge preservation protocol' that identifies and transfers valuable parameters from deprecated models appears to be a novel contribution to the field. The integration of this with an entropy-based metric for quantifying module specialization also represents a fresh approach. While Mixture-of-Experts and knowledge distillation are established techniques, their application in a decentralized, continual learning framework focused on sustainability and knowledge preservation represents an innovative synthesis. The idea doesn't completely reinvent the fundamental techniques (it builds on existing concepts like MoE and distillation), but it combines and extends them in ways that address important unresolved challenges in the field, particularly around model sustainability and knowledge reuse."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate implementation challenges. On the positive side, it builds upon established techniques like knowledge distillation and Mixture-of-Experts, which have proven implementations. The modular nature of the proposed system also allows for incremental development and testing. However, several significant challenges exist: (1) Designing an effective 'knowledge preservation protocol' that can reliably identify valuable parameters across different model architectures is non-trivial; (2) Creating a dynamic routing mechanism that efficiently activates the right expert modules without introducing excessive computational overhead is challenging; (3) Preventing catastrophic forgetting in a continual learning setting remains an open problem in the field; (4) The entropy-based specialization metric would need careful design and validation. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively represent substantial technical hurdles that would require significant research effort to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in modern deep learning: the unsustainable practice of discarding trained models and the associated waste of computational resources and knowledge. If successful, this approach could fundamentally change how models are developed and maintained, enabling more sustainable and collaborative AI development. The potential impact extends across multiple dimensions: (1) Environmental - reducing the carbon footprint of AI by enabling knowledge reuse rather than retraining; (2) Accessibility - making advanced AI more accessible by reducing computational requirements; (3) Scientific - advancing our understanding of knowledge transfer and modular learning; (4) Practical - enabling continuous improvement of models without complete retraining. The idea directly tackles one of the most pressing challenges in scaling AI systems sustainably, which gives it high significance in the current landscape of AI research."
