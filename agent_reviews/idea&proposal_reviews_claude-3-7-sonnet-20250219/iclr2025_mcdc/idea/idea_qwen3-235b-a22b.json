        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning. It directly addresses the workshop's core concern about the unsustainable practice of discarding deprecated models by proposing a framework to upcycle pretrained models. The idea specifically tackles 'Upcycling and MoE-fication' and 'Routing of Specialized Experts' which are explicitly mentioned as topics of interest. The proposal's emphasis on converting dense models into modular frameworks with dynamic expert routing perfectly matches the workshop's call for innovations in mixture-of-experts architectures and adaptive computation. The only minor reason it's not a perfect 10 is that it could more explicitly address the collaborative and decentralized training aspects mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity, outlining a three-step process: decomposing frozen dense models into expert modules, training lightweight adapters to harmonize outputs, and introducing a router network for sparse activation patterns. The motivation and expected impact are clearly articulated. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific mechanisms for 'parameter clustering' and how the 'self-attention-based input routing' would work in practice. The proposal provides a high-level understanding of the approach but leaves some implementation details somewhat ambiguous, which prevents it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong novelty in its approach to upcycling heterogeneous pretrained models into a unified modular system. While mixture-of-experts and model adaptation techniques exist in the literature, the combination of decomposing frozen pretrained models using parameter clustering, employing self-attention-based routing, and creating a unified framework for heterogeneous models (across different modalities) represents a fresh perspective. The concept of 'dynamic upcycling' that preserves original model knowledge while enabling new compositions is innovative. It's not rated higher because some individual components (like adapters and routing mechanisms) build upon existing techniques, though their integration and application to model upcycling is novel."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Working with frozen pretrained models and adding lightweight adapters is a practical approach that has been demonstrated in other contexts. The parameter clustering and routing mechanisms, while complex, build on established techniques in deep learning. However, there are significant challenges that might arise: (1) effectively decomposing dense models into meaningful expert modules without retraining could be difficult, (2) ensuring that the router network learns efficient sparse activation patterns across heterogeneous experts may require considerable engineering, and (3) maintaining performance while reducing computational costs by 70-90% is an ambitious goal that may be challenging to achieve in practice. These implementation challenges prevent a higher feasibility score."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in deep learning: the unsustainable practice of discarding trained models and the associated computational, environmental, and financial costs. If successful, the approach could fundamentally change how we develop and maintain AI systems, enabling more sustainable and collaborative model ecosystems. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in industry, where the costs of training large models are substantial. The ability to repurpose existing models rather than training from scratch could democratize access to advanced AI capabilities and reduce the environmental footprint of AI research and deployment. The significance is particularly high given the growing concerns about the sustainability of current deep learning practices."
