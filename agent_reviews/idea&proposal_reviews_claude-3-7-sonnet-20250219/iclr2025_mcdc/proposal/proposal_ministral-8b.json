        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning, specifically targeting the unsustainable 'bigger is better' paradigm. The proposal incorporates the core concepts from the research idea, including decentralized knowledge distillation, modular experts, dynamic routing, and knowledge preservation protocols. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing all five key challenges identified: optimization difficulties in modular architectures, balancing stability and plasticity, communication overheads, catastrophic forgetting, and knowledge transfer. The methodology section clearly outlines approaches that connect to the papers cited in the literature review, such as module-to-module knowledge distillation, entropy-based metrics, and decentralized learning frameworks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the algorithmic steps and mathematical formulations. The entropy-based metric for module specialization and the dynamic routing mechanism are precisely defined with mathematical equations. The experimental design outlines a comprehensive evaluation approach with appropriate baseline models and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the specific mechanisms for knowledge preservation could be more detailed, (2) the interaction between the entropy-based metric and the routing algorithm could be more explicitly explained, and (3) the proposal could provide more concrete examples of how the framework would be implemented in practice."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several innovative concepts into a cohesive framework. The combination of decentralized knowledge distillation with modular architectures for continual learning represents a fresh approach to addressing the sustainability challenges in deep learning. The entropy-based metric for module specialization and the knowledge preservation protocol are particularly novel elements. However, many of the individual components draw from existing work in the literature, such as mixture-of-experts architectures, knowledge distillation techniques, and dynamic routing mechanisms. While the integration of these components is innovative, the proposal could benefit from more clearly articulating how its approach differs from or extends beyond the methods described in the literature review, particularly papers like 'm2mKD' and 'Continual Learning with Modular Knowledge Distillation'."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the entropy-based metric and dynamic routing mechanism are well-defined and theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baseline models, task sequences, and evaluation metrics to validate the proposed method. The approach to addressing catastrophic forgetting through modular specialization and knowledge preservation is well-justified based on the literature. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges in optimization for modular architectures and proposes specific methods to address them. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) more detailed analysis of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, (2) clearer justification for why the entropy-based metric is an effective measure of module specialization, and (3) more rigorous theoretical analysis of how the proposed method guarantees knowledge preservation across model generations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation steps. The use of established datasets like ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, and CIFAR100 is practical and appropriate for the research objectives. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined and implementable with current deep learning frameworks. The evaluation metrics are standard and measurable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) the development of an effective knowledge preservation protocol that can identify and transfer valuable parameters across different architectures, (2) the optimization of the dynamic routing mechanism to efficiently activate relevant expert modules without introducing excessive computational overhead, and (3) the coordination of decentralized training across distributed systems. While these challenges are substantial, they are not insurmountable given current technology and methods, making the proposal generally feasible with moderate refinement and optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in deep learning: the unsustainable practice of discarding and retraining models from scratch. By developing a framework for decentralized modular knowledge distillation, the research has the potential to significantly reduce computational costs, improve model adaptability, and enable collaborative development of large-scale models. The expected outcomes align perfectly with the workshop's goals of exploring new paradigms in neural network architectures based on modularity and functional specialization. The impact extends beyond theoretical advancements to practical applications in continual learning, distributed systems, and sustainable AI development. The proposal directly addresses the five key challenges identified in the literature review, potentially making substantial contributions to each area. If successful, this research could fundamentally change how deep learning models are developed, maintained, and evolved over time, representing a significant paradigm shift in the field."
