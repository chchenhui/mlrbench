        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modularity for collaborative, decentralized, and continual deep learning by proposing a decentralized framework of reusable expert modules. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including knowledge distillation, modular experts, dynamic routing, and knowledge preservation. It also builds upon the literature review by integrating concepts from multiple cited papers, such as module-to-module knowledge distillation (m2mKD), decentralized training (DIMAT), entropy-based metrics for module specialization, and continual learning techniques. The methodology section thoroughly details how these components work together in a cohesive framework that addresses the sustainability challenges highlighted in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical components are explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The framework's four main components (decentralized architecture, knowledge preservation protocol, entropy-guided router, and continual learning pipeline) are well-defined, and their interactions are clearly explained. The experimental design section provides specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more details on the peer-to-peer network topology and communication protocols for the decentralized training, and further elaboration on how the Fisher Information Matrix is practically computed and utilized in the knowledge preservation protocol."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of decentralized training, modular architecture, knowledge distillation, and entropy-based routing creates a unique framework that addresses multiple challenges in continual learning. The knowledge preservation protocol using Fisher Information Matrix to identify and transfer critical parameters is a creative approach to model recycling. The entropy-based dynamic routing mechanism for task-adaptive module composition also represents an innovative contribution. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing techniques mentioned in the literature review, such as module-to-module knowledge distillation, decentralized iterative merging, and entropy-based metrics. While the synthesis of these approaches is novel, the proposal could benefit from more groundbreaking innovations in the core algorithms rather than primarily combining existing methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for knowledge distillation, parameter preservation using Fisher Information Matrix, entropy-based routing, and decentralized training are well-defined and theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets (Split-CIFAR100, CORe50, Split-ImageNet) that are standard in continual learning research, and the evaluation metrics (average accuracy, forgetting measure, module specialization score, training efficiency) are well-chosen to assess the framework's performance. The baseline comparisons with established methods (EWC, Synaptic Intelligence, DIMAT) are appropriate. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of key components. However, there could be more discussion of potential failure modes and theoretical limitations of the approach, particularly regarding the convergence properties of the decentralized training algorithm and the potential for module specialization to lead to overfitting in certain domains."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant implementation effort. The modular architecture, knowledge distillation, and entropy-based routing are all implementable with current deep learning frameworks. The datasets mentioned are publicly available, and the baseline methods are well-established. However, there are several practical challenges that may arise: (1) The decentralized training across peers will require substantial engineering for efficient communication and synchronization; (2) Computing the Fisher Information Matrix for large models can be computationally expensive; (3) The dynamic routing mechanism may introduce overhead during inference; and (4) Balancing the various loss terms (task loss, distillation loss, sparsity loss) could require extensive hyperparameter tuning. While these challenges are manageable, they represent non-trivial implementation hurdles that could impact the timeline and resources required for successful execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in deep learning: the unsustainable practice of discarding deprecated models and retraining from scratch. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions. From a sustainability perspective, the reuse of specialized modules could significantly reduce computational costs and carbon footprint, aligning with green AI initiatives. The decentralized, collaborative approach could democratize AI development by enabling distributed teams to contribute specialized modules. The continual learning capabilities could extend the lifespan of models and allow them to adapt to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. The expected outcomes of 15-20% accuracy improvement over EWC and 30-50% reduction in GPU hours represent meaningful advances. The approach is also applicable to multiple domains including robotics, healthcare, and NLP. While the impact could be significant, it may be limited by adoption barriers in production environments where simpler, more established approaches are often preferred."
