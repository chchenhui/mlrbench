        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The AuditGen proposal aligns extremely well with the workshop's focus on bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles. It directly addresses the topic of 'evaluation and auditing frameworks for ensuring ML models comply with regulatory guidelines' and tackles 'new regulation challenges posed by large generative models' specifically in creative industries, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The framework provides a concrete approach to operationalize copyright compliance, which is a key regulatory concern. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some of the other topics like fairness or explainability, but this is acceptable given its focused scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (copyright compliance in generative models), proposes a specific solution (AuditGen framework), and outlines a three-part methodology (curated input probing, output similarity analysis, and risk quantification). The approach is well-structured and logical. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how the 'representative database of known copyrighted works' would be constructed, what specific similarity thresholds would constitute infringement risk, and how the framework would handle edge cases where inspiration versus copying is ambiguous."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in systematically addressing copyright compliance for generative models. While individual components like similarity detection and perceptual hashing exist, their integration into a comprehensive auditing framework specifically for copyright compliance in generative AI represents a fresh approach. The systematic generation of probing inputs designed to trigger copyright violations is particularly innovative. However, the core technical methods mentioned (perceptual hashing, embedding space similarity) are established techniques rather than groundbreaking new algorithms, which somewhat limits the novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technologies. Similarity detection algorithms, perceptual hashing, and embedding comparisons are well-established techniques that could be adapted for this purpose. However, there are significant practical challenges: (1) Creating a comprehensive database of copyrighted works would be resource-intensive and face licensing challenges; (2) Determining appropriate thresholds for 'substantial similarity' that align with legal standards is complex; (3) Generating effective probing inputs that trigger copyright violations without prior knowledge of the training data is difficult. These challenges are substantial but not insurmountable, making the idea feasible with sufficient resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical and timely problem in AI regulation. Copyright compliance is becoming a major legal and ethical concern as generative models become more powerful and widely deployed, with several high-profile lawsuits already underway. The proposed framework could have substantial impact by: (1) Providing developers with practical tools to assess copyright risks before deployment; (2) Helping establish industry standards for copyright compliance; (3) Informing regulatory frameworks with technical insights about how copyright infringement manifests in generative models; and (4) Potentially preventing costly litigation and protecting creative industries. The significance is heightened by the urgent need for such tools as generative AI rapidly proliferates."
