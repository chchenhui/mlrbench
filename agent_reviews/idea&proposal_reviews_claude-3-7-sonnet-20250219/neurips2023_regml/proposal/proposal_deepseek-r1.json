    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles by proposing an automated framework to translate regulatory text into ML constraints. The three-stage approach (Regulatory NLP, Formalization, and Constrained Optimization) follows the structure outlined in the research idea, and the proposal incorporates relevant literature from the review, citing works on legal language models [1], compliance automation [4, 6], constraint verification [7], and fairness policies [10]. The case studies on fair credit scoring and GDPR compliance align with the workshop's topics on fairness and privacy. The only minor inconsistency is that while the workshop mentions challenges posed by large generative models and AGI, the proposal only briefly touches on these in the 'Long-Term Vision' section without detailed methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The three-stage framework is well-defined with specific objectives, techniques, and validation methods for each stage. The use of concrete examples (e.g., translating GDPR's 'right to erasure' into formal logic and then into a penalty function) effectively illustrates the approach. The experimental validation section provides clear metrics for evaluating both performance and compliance. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for conflict resolution between competing constraints could be more detailed, (2) the proposal mentions 'adaptive weighting schemes' without fully explaining how these would be implemented, and (3) some technical details about the integration of constraints into different types of ML models (beyond the loss function formulation) could be elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel end-to-end framework for automating the translation of regulatory text into ML constraints. While individual components draw from existing work (e.g., legal NLP, constraint verification), the integration of these components into a cohesive pipeline represents a fresh approach. The automatic extraction of constraints from legal text and their formalization into differentiable penalties is innovative. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that several cited works already address parts of this pipeline: LegiLM [1] for legal text understanding, Wang et al. [7] for constraint verification, and Shaikh et al. [10] for fairness policies. The proposal extends and combines these approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The multi-objective optimization approach to balancing compliance and performance is not entirely new in the ML fairness literature, though its application to broader regulatory compliance is relatively novel."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The three-stage framework follows a logical progression from text extraction to formalization to optimization. The use of first-order logic for representing regulatory norms and the translation to differentiable penalties is technically valid. The experimental validation plan includes appropriate metrics for both task performance and regulatory compliance. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address the challenges of ambiguity and interpretation in legal text, which could lead to incorrect constraint formulation; (2) the conflict resolution between constraints is mentioned but not thoroughly formalized; (3) the proposal assumes that all regulatory requirements can be expressed as differentiable penalties, which may not always be the case; and (4) while the multi-objective optimization approach is mentioned, the specific algorithms for balancing potentially competing objectives aren't detailed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially feasible research agenda. The implementation plan using existing tools (HuggingFace Transformers, PyTorch, Optuna) is practical. The case studies are well-defined and testable. However, several significant challenges affect feasibility: (1) Accurately extracting structured norms from legal text is extremely difficult given the complexity and ambiguity of legal language; even state-of-the-art NLP models struggle with nuanced legal interpretation. (2) Formalizing legal requirements into logic predicates that capture their full intent without oversimplification requires deep legal expertise. (3) The proposal may underestimate the complexity of resolving conflicts between different regulatory principles (e.g., privacy vs. fairness). (4) The evaluation of compliance is inherently subjective and may require legal experts, which isn't fully addressed in the validation plan. While the individual components have been demonstrated in prior work, their integration into a fully automated pipeline as described would require significant advances beyond the current state of the art."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap between regulatory requirements and ML implementation that has significant implications for the responsible deployment of AI systems. If successful, Policy2Constraint could substantially reduce the manual effort required for regulatory compliance, enable more consistent implementation of legal requirements, and facilitate adaptation to evolving regulations. The potential impact spans technical, societal, and policy domains, as outlined in the proposal. The work directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging gaps between ML research and regulatory principles. The significance is enhanced by the growing regulatory landscape for AI (e.g., EU AI Act, GDPR) and the increasing deployment of ML in high-stakes domains. The toolkit, benchmarks, and guidelines proposed as outcomes would provide valuable resources for both researchers and practitioners. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the challenges in achieving full automation of legal interpretation and the need for domain-specific adaptations for different regulatory frameworks."
