    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on watermarking in generative AI, particularly emphasizing adversarial robustness and evaluation benchmarks. The proposal builds upon the research idea of dynamic adversarial training for robust watermarking, maintaining the core concept of co-training a watermark embedder with adversarial attack models. The literature review is thoroughly integrated, with explicit references to works like InvisMark, REMARK-LLM, and Certifiably Robust Watermark. The proposal addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as the imperceptibility-robustness trade-off and generalization to unseen attacks. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions text watermarking techniques extensively, the proposal could have more explicitly connected to some of these specific text watermarking approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a comprehensive mathematical formulation of the approach, clearly defining the generator loss, adversarial attacker loss, and training procedure. The experimental design, including baselines, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks, is well-specified. The expected outcomes and impact are concretely articulated with quantifiable targets. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific implementation details of the adversarial attack models could be more thoroughly explained, (2) the exact mechanism for how the detector D works is not fully elaborated, and (3) the proposal could more clearly explain how the framework will balance the minimax optimization to prevent mode collapse or training instability, which are common challenges in adversarial training."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a dynamic adversarial training framework specifically for watermarking generative AI outputs. While adversarial training itself is not new, the application to watermarking in a co-evolving framework that simultaneously optimizes for robustness and imperceptibility represents a fresh approach. The proposal innovatively combines techniques from adversarial machine learning with watermarking methods, addressing a gap identified in the literature (Thakkar et al., 2023). The mathematical formulation of the minimax optimization framework for watermarking is a valuable contribution. However, the core concept builds upon existing adversarial training paradigms, and some elements (like the attack types) are adaptations of standard techniques rather than entirely novel approaches. The proposal could have pushed boundaries further by introducing more innovative attack simulation methods or detection mechanisms beyond the current state-of-the-art."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation is comprehensive and well-justified, clearly defining the loss functions for both the generator and adversarial attackers. The minimax optimization framework is theoretically sound and aligns with established principles in adversarial machine learning. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical validation approaches. The proposal also acknowledges the trade-off between imperceptibility and robustness, which is a key technical challenge in watermarking. The data collection strategy is comprehensive, covering diverse sources for both images and text. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the proposal could benefit from more detailed theoretical analysis of convergence properties in the minimax game, (2) there could be more discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, and (3) while the proposal mentions quantifying trade-offs, it could provide more specific methodological details on how these trade-offs will be systematically explored and optimized."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technologies and methods. The data sources (LAION-5B, COCO, C4, WikiText) are publicly available, and the baseline methods (InvisMark, REMARK-LLM) have published implementations. The adversarial attacks described are implementable using standard techniques. The evaluation metrics and benchmarks are well-defined and measurable. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) the computational resources required for co-training multiple adversarial models may be substantial, especially for high-resolution images or large text corpora, (2) balancing the minimax optimization to ensure stable convergence can be challenging in practice, (3) the proposal aims for ambitious performance targets (>95% bit accuracy under 10+ attack types), which may be difficult to achieve simultaneously with high imperceptibility, and (4) the development of comprehensive benchmarks across both text and image modalities represents a significant undertaking. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do increase implementation complexity and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of generative AI: ensuring the provenance and authenticity of AI-generated content through robust watermarking. This has significant implications for trust, security, and intellectual property protection in an era of increasingly sophisticated generative models. The research directly supports industries requiring reliable content authentication and could inform regulatory standards for AI watermarking (e.g., EU AI Act). The expected outcomes—particularly a dynamic watermarking framework with substantially improved robustness and open-source benchmark tools—would make meaningful contributions to both academic research and practical applications. The proposal also bridges gaps between adversarial machine learning and watermarking techniques, potentially advancing both fields. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's attention to quantifying trade-offs between imperceptibility and robustness, which addresses a fundamental challenge in the field. While the impact is substantial, it is somewhat constrained to the specific domain of watermarking rather than transforming broader aspects of AI safety or security."
