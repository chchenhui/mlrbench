    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of developing universal AI methods for scale transition in complex systems, focusing on the 'New scientific result' track. The NeuroScale framework incorporates the three key innovations outlined in the idea: scale-adaptive attention mechanisms, physics-informed regularization, and uncertainty quantification. The proposal thoroughly integrates insights from the literature review, citing all ten papers and addressing the identified challenges of data scarcity, computational efficiency, physical constraints, uncertainty quantification, and cross-domain generalizability. The methodology section clearly builds upon existing neural operator approaches while introducing novel components to address multiscale modeling challenges. The only minor inconsistency is that some references in the proposal (e.g., [5-10]) don't perfectly match the numbering in the literature review, but the content and concepts are still accurately represented."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical concepts are explained thoroughly with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable to readers familiar with the field. The NeuroScale architecture is described in detail, including the base operator, scale-adaptive attention module, cross-scale physics-informed regularization, and uncertainty quantification module. The training procedure and experimental design are also well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the scale-adaptive attention mechanism and the cross-scale physics regularization could be more explicitly connected; (2) Some technical details about how the UQ module integrates with the overall architecture during training could be elaborated; and (3) The proposal could more clearly specify the exact physical laws that will be enforced in the benchmark problems. Despite these minor issues, the overall clarity is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The NeuroScale framework presents significant novelty in its approach to multiscale modeling. While neural operators and physics-informed neural networks exist in the literature, the proposal introduces several innovative components: (1) The scale-adaptive attention mechanism that dynamically weights features at different resolutions is a novel approach to handling multiscale information; (2) The cross-scale physics-informed regularization that explicitly enforces consistency across scales goes beyond standard PINNs which typically enforce physics at a single scale; (3) The integration of uncertainty quantification specifically designed to capture information loss during scale transitions is innovative. The proposal builds upon existing work (like FNO, PINNs) but extends them in meaningful ways specifically for the multiscale challenge. The combination of these three components into a unified framework represents a fresh approach not previously explored in the cited literature. However, some individual components (like attention mechanisms or UQ in neural networks) are adaptations of existing techniques rather than completely new inventions, which is why the score is not higher."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall. The mathematical formulations for the neural operator, attention mechanism, and physics-informed regularization are well-defined and theoretically grounded. The training procedure and loss functions are appropriately specified. The experimental design includes relevant benchmark problems, baselines, and evaluation metrics that would effectively test the claims. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in balancing the different loss terms (data loss vs. physics loss) during training, though it mentions adaptive weighting; (2) While the cross-scale physics regularization is well-motivated, the specific implementation details for ensuring numerical stability across vastly different scales are not fully elaborated; (3) The proposal mentions Bayesian Neural Operators for UQ but doesn't fully address the computational challenges of implementing these for high-dimensional problems. The theoretical foundations are solid, but some practical implementation details that would affect the rigor of the approach are not completely specified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan, but with several significant challenges. On the positive side: (1) The methodology builds on established neural operator frameworks that have demonstrated success; (2) The experimental design is well-structured with clear benchmarks and evaluation metrics; (3) The data generation approach using existing high-fidelity solvers is practical. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) The computational resources required for training neural operators on high-resolution multiscale data would be substantial, especially when incorporating Bayesian approaches for UQ; (2) The proposal aims to address multiple challenging problems (scale-adaptive attention, cross-scale physics, UQ) simultaneously, which increases implementation complexity; (3) The generalizability across different scientific domains (materials, fluids, reaction-diffusion) as proposed is ambitious and may require domain-specific adaptations; (4) Training stable models that balance data fidelity with multiple physics constraints across scales is known to be challenging, as noted in the literature review. While the individual components have precedent in the literature, their integration into a cohesive, efficient framework represents a significant engineering challenge that may require substantial iteration and refinement."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in computational science that has direct relevance to the workshop's goal of 'solving science' through scale transition. If successful, NeuroScale would have exceptional significance: (1) It would enable more efficient and accurate multiscale simulations across multiple scientific domains, potentially accelerating research in high-impact areas like materials science, fusion energy, and climate modeling; (2) The framework's ability to quantify uncertainty during scale transitions would improve the reliability and trustworthiness of multiscale models; (3) The computational speedups (potentially thousands of times faster than high-fidelity simulations) would allow scientists to explore parameter spaces and time horizons previously inaccessible; (4) The generalizable approach to scale transition represents progress toward more universal AI methods for scientific discovery, directly addressing the workshop's central theme. The proposal convincingly articulates how advances in this area could transform computational approaches to previously intractable problems, making it highly significant both methodologically and in terms of potential scientific impact."
