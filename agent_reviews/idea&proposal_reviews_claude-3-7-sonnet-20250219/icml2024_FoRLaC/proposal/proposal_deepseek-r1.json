    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging reinforcement learning and control theory, specifically targeting stability guarantees which is a key topic mentioned in the task description. The proposal builds upon the research idea of integrating Lyapunov stability theory into RL through joint training of policies and Lyapunov functions. It also thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing and building upon works like McCutcheon et al. (2025) and Chen et al. (2025) for self-supervised data generation and SAC-CLF framework comparison. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposal will implement the neural Lyapunov function approach mentioned in the research idea, and the evaluation metrics align with the expected outcomes stated in both the idea and literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate mathematical formulations. The neural architecture, stability constraints, optimization formulation, and training pipeline are all well-defined. The experimental validation section provides specific benchmarks and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the Lyapunov network and the policy network could be more explicitly defined in terms of how they interact during training; (2) The exact mechanism for ensuring the Lyapunov condition holds globally (rather than just on sampled states) could be elaborated; and (3) Some technical details about the implementation of the Lagrangian dual formulation could be more thoroughly explained. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by focusing on the joint optimization of policies and neural Lyapunov functions, which is identified as a key gap in existing research. While the individual components (neural Lyapunov functions, constrained policy optimization) have been explored in prior work as shown in the literature review, the proposal offers a fresh integration of these concepts with several innovative elements: (1) The self-supervised data generation method adapted from McCutcheon et al. to ensure Lyapunov function validity across the entire state space; (2) The specific formulation of the augmented Lagrangian loss that balances reward optimization with Lyapunov stability constraints; and (3) The three-step training pipeline that alternates between policy and Lyapunov function updates. However, the core approach builds upon existing methods rather than introducing a completely novel paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of the Lyapunov decay condition and the constrained optimization problem is theoretically sound and well-grounded in control theory principles. The use of the augmented Lagrangian method for handling constraints is appropriate and well-justified. The training pipeline with alternating updates between policy and Lyapunov networks follows established practices in multi-objective optimization. The experimental validation plan includes appropriate baselines and metrics that directly measure the claimed benefits (stability, robustness, and performance). However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal could provide more detailed theoretical analysis on the convergence properties of the joint optimization process; (2) The conditions under which the learned Lyapunov function provides a valid stability certificate could be more rigorously defined; and (3) The robustness guarantees against specific types of perturbations could be more formally established. Despite these areas for improvement, the overall technical approach is sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The use of established simulation environments (OpenAI Gym, MuJoCo, PyBullet) makes the experimental validation practical. The neural network architectures and optimization techniques described are implementable with current deep learning frameworks. The three-step training pipeline provides a clear roadmap for implementation. However, there are some feasibility challenges: (1) Ensuring global validity of the Lyapunov function across the entire state space may be computationally intensive for high-dimensional systems; (2) The alternating optimization between policy and Lyapunov networks might face convergence issues in practice; (3) The computational resources required for the proposed benchmarks, especially for the chemical process simulation, could be substantial; and (4) The expected stability rate of ≥90% may be ambitious for complex nonlinear systems under significant perturbations. While these challenges are notable, they don't render the proposal infeasible, but rather highlight areas requiring careful implementation and potential adjustments during execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in reinforcement learning: the lack of formal stability guarantees that limits RL's application in safety-critical domains. This work has the potential for substantial impact across multiple dimensions: (1) Theoretical significance: It bridges two important fields (RL and control theory) in a principled manner, potentially leading to new theoretical insights in both areas; (2) Practical significance: It could enable the deployment of RL in high-stakes applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, and industrial automation where stability guarantees are essential; (3) Methodological significance: The joint optimization framework could inspire new approaches to constrained RL beyond stability considerations. The expected outcomes (provably stable RL policies with comparable performance to unconstrained methods) would represent a significant advancement in the field. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's goal of connecting reinforcement learning and control theory to tackle large-scale applications, making it highly relevant and potentially impactful for the research community."
