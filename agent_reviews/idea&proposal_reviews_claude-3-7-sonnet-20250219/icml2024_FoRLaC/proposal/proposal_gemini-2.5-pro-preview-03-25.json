    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging reinforcement learning and control theory by integrating Lyapunov stability theory into RL frameworks. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the core concept from the research idea of jointly training policies and Lyapunov functions via neural networks with constrained optimization. It also comprehensively addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, including Lyapunov function design, balancing performance and stability, computational complexity, and robustness to uncertainty. The methodology section provides a detailed mathematical formulation that is consistent with both RL principles and control theory foundations. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal uses the acronym LIRL (Lyapunov-Informed Reinforcement Learning) rather than the exact title from the idea (Lyapunov-Stable Reinforcement Learning), but the core concepts remain identical."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, literature context, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, with appropriate notation and clear explanations of the Lyapunov stability conditions and how they are incorporated into the RL framework. The algorithm outline provides a step-by-step description of the proposed approach, making implementation feasible. The experimental design section clearly outlines environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the Lyapunov network and the value function could be more explicitly differentiated for readers less familiar with control theory; (2) Some technical details about handling unknown dynamics in the constraint evaluation could be elaborated further; and (3) The proposal occasionally uses technical terminology without full explanation (e.g., 'class K function', 'Input-to-State Stability') which might be challenging for readers without a strong control theory background."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by integrating several innovative elements. The joint optimization of policy, value function, and neural Lyapunov function within a constrained policy optimization framework using Lagrangian methods is a fresh approach. The explicit incorporation of robustness considerations into the Lyapunov conditions is also innovative. However, the core idea of combining Lyapunov theory with RL is not entirely new, as evidenced by the literature review which includes several papers on similar topics (e.g., SAC-CLF, Lyapunov-based constrained policy optimization). The proposal builds incrementally on these existing approaches rather than presenting a fundamentally new paradigm. The main novelty lies in the specific formulation of the constraint, the joint training procedure, and the explicit focus on robustness to disturbances. While these contributions are valuable, they represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary advances in the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The mathematical formulation of the Lyapunov stability conditions is rigorous and correctly applies control theory principles to the RL setting. The constrained optimization approach using Lagrangian multipliers is a well-established method for handling constraints in optimization problems. The proposal correctly identifies the challenges in learning Lyapunov functions and proposes reasonable solutions (e.g., using loss terms to enforce positive definiteness). The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that directly measure the claimed benefits of stability and robustness. However, there are a few areas that could be strengthened: (1) The theoretical guarantees section mentions 'probabilistic guarantees' but doesn't fully elaborate on the statistical nature of these guarantees; (2) The handling of unknown dynamics in the constraint evaluation could benefit from more rigorous treatment; and (3) The proposal could more explicitly address the potential limitations of the approach, such as the scalability to high-dimensional systems or the potential conservativeness of Lyapunov-based constraints."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable scope. The methodology builds on established RL algorithms (e.g., SAC) and control theory concepts, making implementation practical with existing tools and frameworks. The experimental environments (pendulum, cartpole, reacher, hopper) are standard benchmarks with available implementations. However, there are several challenges that affect feasibility: (1) The joint optimization of policy, value function, and Lyapunov function is computationally intensive and may require significant hyperparameter tuning to achieve stability in training; (2) Learning effective Lyapunov functions for complex, high-dimensional systems remains difficult, as acknowledged in the proposal; (3) The evaluation of robustness to disturbances requires careful implementation of perturbation mechanisms; and (4) The theoretical analysis to establish formal guarantees may be mathematically challenging, especially for nonlinear systems with neural network policies. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal infeasible, but rather indicate that some aspects may require more effort or yield less comprehensive results than anticipated."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in reinforcement learning: the lack of formal stability guarantees that limits RL's application in safety-critical domains. By bridging RL and control theory, the research has the potential for substantial impact in both theoretical advancement and practical applications. The significance is particularly high for domains requiring reliable autonomous systems, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. The proposal correctly identifies that providing stability and robustness guarantees could significantly increase trust in RL-based controllers, enabling their deployment in high-stakes applications. The research also contributes to the theoretical foundations of safe RL and the integration of formal methods with learning-based approaches. However, the practical impact may be somewhat limited by the complexity of the approach and potential challenges in scaling to very high-dimensional systems or systems with significant uncertainty. Additionally, while the proposal represents an important step toward certifiable AI systems, it addresses only one aspect of safety (stability) rather than comprehensive safety guarantees."
