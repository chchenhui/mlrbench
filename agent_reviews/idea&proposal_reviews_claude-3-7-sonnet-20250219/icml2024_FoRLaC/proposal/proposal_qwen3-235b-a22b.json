        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging reinforcement learning and control theory, specifically targeting the lack of theoretical guarantees in RL through Lyapunov stability theory. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the joint training of policy and Lyapunov networks, constrained optimization approach, and expected outcomes. The literature review is thoroughly integrated, with the proposal building upon recent works like McCutcheon et al. (2025), Chen et al. (2025), and Sun et al. (2023). The proposal acknowledges and addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as scalability to high-dimensional systems and robustness to unmodeled dynamics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is presented with appropriate mathematical formulations. The dual-network architecture, Lyapunov constraints, and training algorithm are all explained in detail. The experimental design outlines specific benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the Lyapunov decay rate parameter γ and the RL discount factor γ_RL could be more explicitly differentiated; (2) the model-based acceleration section could provide more details on how the dynamics model is integrated with the Lyapunov constraints; and (3) the proposal could more clearly explain how the Lyapunov network is initialized and constrained to ensure V_φ(s) ≥ 0 and V_φ(s*) = 0."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a unified framework that jointly learns control policies and Lyapunov functions through neural networks. While individual components like neural Lyapunov functions and constrained policy optimization have been explored in prior work (as noted in the literature review), the integration of these approaches with model-based acceleration and adversarial training for robustness represents a fresh perspective. The proposal acknowledges existing methods like SAC-CLF (Chen et al., 2025) and distributed Lyapunov-based RL (Yao et al., 2024), but differentiates itself by addressing their limitations in scalability, computational efficiency, and robustness. However, the core concept of combining Lyapunov stability with RL has been explored in several cited papers, which somewhat limits the groundbreaking nature of the proposal."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The Lyapunov stability conditions are correctly formulated for discrete-time systems, and the constrained optimization problem is well-defined. The Lagrangian relaxation approach for enforcing constraints is mathematically sound. The training algorithm alternating between policy updates and Lyapunov function refinement follows established practices in constrained optimization. The experimental design includes appropriate benchmarks and baselines for validation. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further theoretical justification: (1) the convergence properties of the joint optimization of policy and Lyapunov networks are not thoroughly analyzed; (2) the proposal could provide more detailed theoretical guarantees on how the learned Lyapunov function certifies stability under model uncertainties; and (3) the interaction between the model-based acceleration and the Lyapunov constraints could be more rigorously formulated."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods. The neural network architectures for policy and Lyapunov functions are implementable with current deep learning frameworks. The constrained optimization via Lagrangian relaxation is a well-established technique. The experimental benchmarks (pendulum, cartpole, robotics simulators) are standard and accessible. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) training neural networks to satisfy Lyapunov conditions across the entire state space is difficult and may require careful architecture design and regularization; (2) the model-based acceleration component adds complexity and may introduce model errors that affect stability guarantees; (3) scaling to high-dimensional systems like quadrupedal locomotion and industrial control may require significant computational resources; and (4) the adversarial training for robustness may be challenging to tune effectively. These challenges are manageable but will require careful implementation and possibly methodological refinements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of reinforcement learning and control theory: the lack of formal stability guarantees in RL that limits its adoption in safety-critical domains. By bridging these paradigms, the work has the potential to enable significant advancements in autonomous systems, industrial automation, and adaptive control. The expected contributions are substantial and clearly articulated, including provably stable policies for nonlinear systems and insights into the interplay between reward maximization and stability constraints. The practical applications span multiple high-impact domains such as autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and healthcare robotics. The proposal also emphasizes community advancement through open-source implementations and benchmarks, fostering collaboration between RL and control theory communities. This work directly addresses a fundamental limitation in current RL approaches and could significantly expand the applicability of learning-based control to real-world safety-critical systems."
