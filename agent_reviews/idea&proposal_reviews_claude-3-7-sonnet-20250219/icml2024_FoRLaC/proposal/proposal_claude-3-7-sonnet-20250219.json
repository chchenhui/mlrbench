    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging reinforcement learning and control theory, specifically targeting the lack of theoretical guarantees in RL that hinders its application in safety-critical domains. The proposal's core methodology of integrating Lyapunov stability theory into RL matches precisely with the research idea of jointly training policies and Lyapunov functions via neural networks. The literature review highlights recent work in Lyapunov-based RL approaches, and the proposal builds upon these foundations while addressing identified challenges. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges like balancing exploration and safety, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed how it overcomes these specific challenges identified in prior work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical formulations are precise and well-presented, with appropriate mathematical notation and explanations. The problem formulation, Lyapunov stability criteria, joint learning approach, and algorithm details are all thoroughly explained. The experimental design section provides specific tasks and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the Lyapunov function parameterization and the policy network could be more explicitly connected in some sections, (2) Some technical details about the adversarial training approach could be further elaborated, particularly regarding how the worst-case perturbation is computed in practice, and (3) The transition between theoretical guarantees and practical implementation could be more seamlessly integrated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel framework that integrates Lyapunov stability theory with reinforcement learning in a comprehensive manner. The joint optimization of policy and Lyapunov function, particularly using neural networks to parameterize both components, represents an innovative approach. The incorporation of adversarial training to enhance robustness is also a valuable contribution. However, as evidenced by the literature review, several recent papers have explored similar concepts of combining Lyapunov functions with RL. While this proposal offers a more comprehensive framework and addresses some limitations of prior work (particularly in terms of scalability and robustness), it builds incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly highlighting its specific innovations beyond what has been presented in the cited literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and soundness. The mathematical formulations of Lyapunov stability conditions are correctly presented, and the integration with RL optimization is theoretically well-founded. The parameterization of the Lyapunov function ensures that the positive definiteness and radial unboundedness conditions are satisfied by construction. The transformation of the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one using Lagrangian methods is mathematically sound. The algorithm design includes appropriate mechanisms for ensuring the Lyapunov conditions are maintained during learning. The robustness enhancement through adversarial training is well-justified with proper mathematical formulation. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. Overall, the technical approach is rigorous and builds on established principles from both control theory and reinforcement learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined algorithmic steps and experimental validation plans. The selected benchmark tasks (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, quadrotor, robotic arm) are appropriate and commonly used in control and RL research. The implementation of the joint learning of policy and Lyapunov function is computationally tractable with current deep learning frameworks. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The computational complexity of enforcing Lyapunov constraints during training might be significant, especially for high-dimensional systems like quadrotors, (2) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle cases where finding a valid Lyapunov function is challenging or when the system dynamics are partially unknown, (3) The adversarial training component might introduce additional computational burden that could affect scalability, and (4) The evaluation on physical systems (beyond simulation) is not explicitly addressed, which would be crucial for real-world validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental limitation in reinforcement learning: the lack of formal stability guarantees. This is a critical barrier to the adoption of RL in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and medical robots. By bridging the gap between control theory's rigorous stability frameworks and RL's adaptability, the research has the potential for significant impact across multiple domains. The expected outcomes include not just theoretical contributions (formal stability guarantees, characterization of regions of attraction) but also practical advances (improved robustness, transfer learning capabilities). The broader impact section convincingly argues for the transformative potential of this work in enabling RL deployment in high-stakes domains, fostering collaboration between RL and control theory communities, and establishing new design paradigms. The significance is further enhanced by the growing importance of reliable autonomous systems in various industries."
