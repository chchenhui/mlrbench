    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging reinforcement learning and control theory, specifically targeting the integration of Lyapunov stability theory into RL frameworks. The methodology section thoroughly elaborates on the joint training of policies and Lyapunov functions using neural networks, which was the core concept in the research idea. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges identified in the literature review, such as balancing performance with stability guarantees. The experimental design includes appropriate control benchmarks mentioned in both the idea and literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions safe exploration during learning, the proposal doesn't explicitly address exploration strategies in detail."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with well-defined steps. The mathematical formulations for policy optimization and Lyapunov function training are precisely stated. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are also clearly outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the penalty parameter λ and the stability constraints could be more explicitly defined; (2) The definition of the 'expected Lyapunov value' V̄ in the Lyapunov function training is somewhat ambiguous; and (3) The proposal could more clearly specify how the stability guarantees will be formally verified during evaluation. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating Lyapunov stability theory with reinforcement learning in a comprehensive framework. While the literature review shows that similar approaches have been explored, this proposal offers fresh perspectives through its specific implementation of joint training of policy and Lyapunov function networks. The constrained policy optimization method with Lyapunov conditions enforced via penalties or Lagrangian dual formulation represents an innovative approach. However, the core concept of combining Lyapunov functions with RL is not entirely new, as evidenced by the literature review which includes several papers on Lyapunov-based RL for safe and stable control. The proposal builds upon these existing approaches rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which is why it scores well but not at the highest level of novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations from both reinforcement learning and control theory. The mathematical formulations for policy optimization and Lyapunov function training are correctly presented and align with established principles in both fields. The integration of Lyapunov stability theory into the RL framework is well-justified and theoretically coherent. The experimental design includes appropriate control benchmarks and evaluation metrics that can effectively validate the approach. However, there are a few areas where the technical rigor could be enhanced: (1) The proposal could provide more detailed conditions for when the Lyapunov function is valid; (2) The convergence properties of the joint training procedure could be more thoroughly analyzed; and (3) The robustness of the approach to model uncertainties and disturbances could be more explicitly addressed. Despite these minor limitations, the overall technical foundation of the proposal is strong."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach that can be implemented with current technology and methods. The algorithm design is clearly specified with concrete steps that can be followed. The experimental design includes standard control benchmarks that are widely available and commonly used for validation. The computational requirements, while potentially significant for complex systems, are within the capabilities of modern computing resources. However, there are some implementation challenges that affect the feasibility score: (1) Training neural networks to accurately represent Lyapunov functions for complex nonlinear systems may require significant hyperparameter tuning and architectural design; (2) The joint optimization of policy and Lyapunov networks might face convergence issues due to competing objectives; and (3) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle cases where a valid Lyapunov function might be difficult to learn. These challenges don't render the approach infeasible, but they do introduce moderate implementation complexity that would require careful handling."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the field of reinforcement learning: the lack of formal stability guarantees that hinders RL's application in safety-critical systems. By integrating Lyapunov stability theory into RL, the research has the potential to significantly impact how control policies are developed for high-stakes applications such as autonomous vehicles and industrial automation. The expected outcomes—provably stable RL policies that maintain performance comparable to unconstrained RL—would represent a major advancement in the field. This work directly responds to the workshop's call for bridging reinforcement learning and control theory, potentially enabling new applications of RL in domains traditionally dominated by classical control approaches. The broader impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in industry, potentially transforming how autonomous systems are designed and certified for safety-critical operations."
