    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core focus on connecting reinforcement learning and control theory, particularly emphasizing theoretical guarantees for high-stakes applications. The proposal incorporates multiple topics explicitly mentioned in the task description: stability and robustness guarantees, hybrid approaches combining offline/online methods, performance measures, nonlinear systems, and partial observability (POMDPs). The idea's focus on Lyapunov-guided optimization and physics-informed neural models directly addresses the workshop's interest in bridging theory with applications in safety-critical domains like autonomous drones, which are mentioned as target applications in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. The three key components (structured hybrid architecture, Lyapunov-guided policy optimization, and memory-augmented exploration) are well-defined and logically organized. The motivation clearly establishes the problem and the gap being addressed. The expected outcomes and impact are explicitly stated. The only minor ambiguities lie in the technical details of how the physics-informed neural model would decompose system dynamics and how exactly the Lyapunov-function-based regularizers would be formulated mathematically. While these implementation details would naturally be expanded in a full paper, a slightly more specific description of the mathematical approach would have earned a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to integrating control theory with deep RL. While both fields have been studied extensively and some prior work exists on combining them, this proposal offers fresh perspectives through its three-component architecture. Particularly innovative is the combination of Lyapunov-function-based regularizers with RL loss functions and the integration of Kalman filters with neural memory modules for partial observability. The physics-informed neural model approach is relatively new in the RL context. The idea doesn't represent a completely revolutionary paradigm shift (which would warrant a 9-10), but rather a thoughtful and innovative combination of existing concepts from both fields with novel integration mechanisms, making it a strong 8 in novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The structured hybrid architecture and Lyapunov-guided policy optimization have theoretical foundations in both fields, making them implementable with current technology and methods. However, effectively decomposing system dynamics into known physical constraints and unknown residuals in complex environments would require significant expertise in both physics modeling and neural networks. The memory-augmented exploration component combining Kalman filters with neural memory modules presents additional complexity. While all components are technically feasible, their integration into a cohesive framework that maintains theoretical guarantees while scaling to high-dimensional problems would require considerable engineering effort and mathematical rigor. The validation on autonomous drones is ambitious but achievable with appropriate resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current RL applications: the lack of stability and robustness guarantees in high-stakes systems. By bridging control theory and deep RL, it could enable the deployment of learning-based systems in safety-critical applications that currently rely on more conservative approaches. The potential impact is substantial across multiple domains including robotics, industrial automation, and autonomous vehicles. The theoretical contributions would advance fundamental understanding of how to incorporate formal guarantees into learning systems. The practical significance is equally high, as success could lead to more sample-efficient, robust, and trustworthy RL systems that could be deployed in real-world scenarios where current approaches are deemed too risky. This dual theoretical-practical significance justifies the high score."
