        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's core focus on bridging reinforcement learning and control theory, specifically targeting the integration of stability guarantees from control theory with the flexibility of RL approaches. The proposal's emphasis on Lyapunov stability analysis within policy gradient methods perfectly matches the workshop's interest in 'performance measures and guarantees' and 'fundamental assumptions' around stability. The idea also touches on continuous state/action spaces and has clear applications to industrial automation and autonomous vehicles, which are explicitly mentioned in the task description as target applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (gap between RL and control theory), proposes a specific solution (Robust Policy Gradient Methods with Lyapunov stability constraints), and outlines a two-step implementation process. The application domains are also clearly specified. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how exactly the approximate Lyapunov functions would be learned from data and how the constraints would be formulated mathematically in the policy optimization process. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by proposing a specific mechanism to integrate Lyapunov stability analysis with policy gradient methods. While both Lyapunov functions and policy gradients are established concepts in their respective fields, their integration in the proposed constrained optimization framework represents a fresh approach. However, there have been previous works exploring Lyapunov-based approaches in RL and safe RL, so the idea builds upon existing research directions rather than introducing a completely new paradigm. The novelty lies in the specific formulation and implementation strategy rather than in the conceptual foundation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Learning approximate Lyapunov functions from data is non-trivial, especially for complex, high-dimensional systems. Similarly, incorporating stability constraints into policy optimization without severely restricting the policy space or making optimization intractable requires careful algorithm design. The proposal acknowledges these challenges by suggesting a two-step approach, but doesn't detail how these difficulties will be overcome. The idea is implementable with current technology and methods, but would require considerable mathematical development and computational resources to realize effectively."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap between theory and practice in autonomous systems. By combining the theoretical guarantees of control theory with the flexibility of reinforcement learning, it could enable the application of RL to safety-critical domains that currently rely on more conservative control approaches. The potential impact is substantial across multiple high-stakes applications mentioned in both the idea and task description, including industrial automation and autonomous vehicles. If successful, this work could significantly advance the field by creating a new class of algorithms that maintain formal guarantees while handling complex, high-dimensional problems that traditional control theory struggles with."
