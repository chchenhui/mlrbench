        "justification": "The NeuroGuided Protein Design idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on adaptive experimental design and active learning in real-world applications. Protein design is explicitly mentioned as one of the target applications in the workshop description. The proposal directly addresses the need for data-efficient learning through an active learning framework that makes intelligent decisions about which experiments to perform. It incorporates Bayesian optimization, uncertainty estimation, and efficient exploration of high-dimensional spaces using neural networks - all topics specifically mentioned in the workshop's areas of interest. The idea also integrates domain knowledge from biology, another highlighted aspect of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (navigating vast protein sequence space efficiently), the proposed solution (combining deep learning with Bayesian optimization in an active learning framework), and the expected benefits (60-80% reduction in experimental iterations). The three-step iterative process is well-defined, making the methodology easy to understand. The hierarchical representation concept is mentioned but could benefit from slightly more elaboration on how exactly it captures both local and global protein patterns. Overall, the idea is well-articulated with only minor ambiguities that don't significantly impede understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing approaches (neural networks, Bayesian optimization, active learning) in a potentially innovative way for protein engineering. The hierarchical representation that captures both local structural motifs and global folding patterns appears to be a novel contribution that could enable better knowledge transfer between related proteins. However, the core components of using surrogate models, acquisition functions balancing exploration/exploitation, and iterative refinement are established techniques in active learning. The innovation lies more in the specific application to protein design and the hierarchical representation rather than in fundamentally new algorithmic approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Deep learning models for protein function prediction exist, as do Bayesian optimization frameworks. The active learning loop described is implementable with current tools. However, there are moderate challenges: developing an effective hierarchical representation that truly captures both local and global protein properties is non-trivial; the computational cost of training ensemble models on protein data could be substantial; and the approach would require integration with wet-lab validation, which adds complexity. The claim of 60-80% reduction in experimental iterations seems optimistic without supporting evidence, but the overall approach is technically implementable with current resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a highly significant problem in protein engineering with broad implications for therapeutics, enzymes, and materials development. If successful, a 60-80% reduction in experimental iterations would dramatically accelerate protein engineering and potentially lead to breakthroughs in drug development, industrial enzymes, and biomaterials. The approach could significantly reduce costs and time in these fields. The significance extends beyond just protein design to potentially influencing how active learning is applied in other biological domains. The impact would be substantial for both academic research and industrial applications, though it's focused primarily on the biological domain rather than having universal applicability across all scientific fields."
