    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the workshop's focus on adaptive experimental design and active learning in real-world applications. It specifically addresses materials discovery, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The proposal incorporates multiple key themes from the task description: multi-fidelity experimentation, domain knowledge integration (physics-informed priors), safety constraints, and efficient exploration in high-dimensional spaces. The idea directly tackles the workshop's goal of developing data-efficient learning strategies for expensive experimental processes. The only minor limitation in alignment is that it doesn't explicitly address some other application domains mentioned in the task (like protein design or causal discovery), but this is appropriate given its focused scope on materials science."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined problem (materials discovery), a specific approach (multi-fidelity active learning with DKL-GP), and clear evaluation metrics (reduction in real-world assay calls). The technical components are explained concisely but comprehensively, including the modeling approach, acquisition function design, and constraint handling. The only minor ambiguities are in the details of how the physics-informed neural network priors would be specifically constructed and integrated, and exactly how the constrained Thompson Sampling would be implemented in this context. These implementation details would need further elaboration in a full proposal, but the core idea and approach are very well articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several advanced techniques in a novel way for materials discovery. The integration of Deep Kernel Learning with multi-fidelity active learning and physics-informed priors represents a fresh approach. The fidelity-aware acquisition function that balances information gain against experimental cost is particularly innovative. However, each individual component (DKL-GPs, multi-fidelity modeling, physics-informed ML, and constrained Thompson Sampling) has been explored in prior work, though perhaps not in this specific combination for materials science. The proposal extends existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic concepts, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score. Nevertheless, the combination and application domain represent a valuable contribution to the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Gaussian Processes with deep kernels are well-established, and multi-fidelity modeling has mature implementations. The proposed integration of physics-informed priors and constrained Thompson Sampling presents some implementation challenges but is achievable with existing techniques. The evaluation on benchmark conductivity and elasticity datasets is practical and well-defined. The main implementation challenges would likely be in the effective integration of domain knowledge into the DKL kernel and ensuring computational efficiency for high-dimensional material descriptors. The proposal acknowledges real-world constraints (cost, safety) and explicitly designs the approach to address them, which strengthens its feasibility. The required expertise spans machine learning and materials science, but this interdisciplinary approach is increasingly common."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is very high. Materials discovery is a critical scientific challenge with enormous potential impact across multiple industries including energy, electronics, and aerospace. The proposed order-of-magnitude reduction in discovery time and cost would represent a major advancement in the field. The approach addresses a fundamental bottleneck in materials science: the high cost and time requirements of experimental testing. By intelligently combining simulation and physical testing, the method could dramatically accelerate innovation cycles. Beyond materials science, the multi-fidelity active learning framework could potentially generalize to other scientific domains facing similar experimental design challenges. The work also contributes to the broader goal of making ML more sample-efficient and practical for real-world scientific applications where data collection is expensive."
