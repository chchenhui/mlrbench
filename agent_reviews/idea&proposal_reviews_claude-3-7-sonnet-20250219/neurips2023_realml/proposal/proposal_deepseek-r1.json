        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on adaptive experimental design and active learning for real-world applications, specifically in materials discovery. The proposed Physics-Constrained Bayesian Optimization (PC-BO) framework fully implements the core idea of integrating physical constraints into the active learning loop through both surrogate models and acquisition functions. The proposal also thoroughly incorporates the literature, referencing works like Smith et al. (2023) and Garcia et al. (2023) while addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as modeling complex physical constraints and balancing exploration with exploitation. The methodology section clearly outlines how physical laws will be integrated at multiple stages, which was a central aspect of the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for the constrained GP model and acquisition function. The experimental design section provides specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics that will be used. The algorithmic workflow is presented in a step-by-step manner that is easy to follow. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact nature of the 'composite kernel' could be explained more intuitively, (2) the process for training constraint classifiers when physical rules are implicit could be elaborated, and (3) more details on how the adaptive weighting of λ would work in practice would strengthen the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a comprehensive framework that integrates physical constraints at multiple levels of the Bayesian optimization process. The composite kernel approach that combines property correlations with constraint encoding is innovative, as is the extension of Expected Improvement with a constraint probability product. The proposal goes beyond existing work by addressing both surrogate modeling and acquisition function design in a unified framework. However, while the approach builds significantly on existing methods, many of the individual components (constrained GPs, physics-informed models) appear in the literature review. The true novelty lies in their integration and application to materials discovery rather than in fundamentally new algorithmic innovations. The proposal could be more explicit about what specific technical advances go beyond the cited works."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on well-established theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for the constrained GP model and acquisition function are correct and appropriate for the task. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear metrics for evaluation and appropriate baselines. The ablation studies will help isolate the contributions of different components. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and offers solutions, such as using sparse GPs for scalability. The integration of physical constraints into both the surrogate model and acquisition function is well-justified from a theoretical perspective. However, there could be more discussion on the theoretical guarantees of the approach, particularly regarding convergence properties of the constrained optimization and how the method handles potentially conflicting physical constraints."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with a clear implementation path. The use of existing tools like PyTorch and GPyTorch makes the technical implementation realistic. The experimental design includes both synthetic and real-world datasets, providing a practical validation strategy. The algorithmic workflow is well-defined and implementable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the computational complexity of training constrained GPs in high-dimensional spaces may be challenging, (2) obtaining reliable physical constraints for diverse materials systems might require significant domain expertise, and (3) the proposal mentions partnering with materials labs but doesn't detail existing partnerships or how these collaborations would be established. While the proposal acknowledges computational bottlenecks and suggests sparse GPs as a solution, it could provide more concrete details on how to address these scalability challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in materials discovery with broad implications for energy storage, catalysis, and nanotechnology. By reducing invalid experiments by ≥50%, the approach could substantially accelerate materials discovery while reducing costs. The work bridges an important gap between theoretical active learning and practical experimental workflows, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals. The open-source software deliverable would provide practical tools for experimentalists across multiple domains. The impact extends beyond materials science to other fields like drug design and alloy optimization. The proposal clearly articulates both theoretical advances (unified framework for incorporating domain knowledge) and practical benefits (accelerated discovery of valid materials). The significance is well-justified and supported by concrete examples of applications."
