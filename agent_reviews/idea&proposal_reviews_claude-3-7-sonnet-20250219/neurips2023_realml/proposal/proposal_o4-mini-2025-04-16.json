    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on adaptive experimental design and active learning in real-world settings, specifically targeting materials discovery. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including physics-constrained Bayesian optimization, integration of physical laws into surrogate models, and modification of acquisition functions. It thoroughly builds upon the literature review, citing all the referenced papers and addressing the key challenges identified. The methodology section clearly outlines how physical constraints (thermodynamic stability, charge neutrality, synthesis feasibility) will be incorporated into both the surrogate model and acquisition function, as suggested in the research idea. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions neural networks for physics-constrained modeling, the proposal focuses primarily on Gaussian Process approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The problem formulation is precise, with well-defined mathematical notation for the optimization problem, constraints, and surrogate models. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the physics-constrained surrogate modeling approach and constraint-aware acquisition functions, including explicit mathematical formulations. The PC-BO algorithm is presented in clear pseudocode format. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are thoroughly described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the multi-fidelity approach and the physics constraints could be more explicitly connected, (2) The exact implementation details of the 'constraint co-kriging' approach are somewhat vague, and (3) The process for selecting which points to evaluate at high vs. low fidelity could be more precisely defined in the algorithm."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts into a unified framework. The key novel aspects include: (1) The combination of constrained Gaussian Processes with physics-based constraints specifically for materials discovery, (2) The development of two variants of physics-aware acquisition functions (CEI and PPEI), (3) The integration of multi-fidelity modeling with physics constraints, and (4) The application to specific materials discovery tasks with real physical constraints. While each individual component (constrained GPs, physics-informed models, multi-fidelity BO) has precedent in the literature, their integration into a comprehensive framework with specific application to materials discovery represents a fresh approach. However, the core methodological components are extensions of existing techniques rather than fundamentally new algorithms, which limits the highest level of novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulation of the constrained optimization problem, Gaussian Process modeling, and acquisition functions is rigorous and correctly presented. The multi-fidelity approach using the Kennedy-O'Hagan framework is well-established. The three strategies for encoding physical knowledge (mean-function encoding, virtual observations, and constraint co-kriging) are theoretically justified. The evaluation metrics are appropriate and comprehensive. The experimental design includes both synthetic benchmarks and real-world materials discovery tasks, providing a robust validation approach. The only minor concerns are: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle potential conflicts between different physical constraints, (2) The tuning of the penalty coefficient λ in the PPEI acquisition function could benefit from more theoretical justification, and (3) The statistical significance assessment with 20 independent seeds may be insufficient for robust conclusions in high-dimensional, noisy settings."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Gaussian Process modeling, Bayesian optimization, and the incorporation of constraints are all established techniques with available software implementations. The multi-fidelity approach is practical and addresses the real-world challenge of expensive evaluations. The experimental design is realistic, with appropriate budgets (50 evaluations) that reflect typical lab throughput. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) Scaling constrained GPs to high-dimensional spaces may be computationally intensive, (2) Obtaining accurate physical constraints for real materials systems might require significant domain expertise or additional modeling, (3) The optimization of acquisition functions with multiple constraints could become complex and computationally expensive, and (4) The real-world materials discovery tasks would require access to specialized laboratory equipment and expertise. While these challenges are manageable, they do require careful consideration and potentially additional resources or collaborations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in materials discovery with potentially high impact. Accelerating the discovery of novel materials has profound implications for energy storage, catalysis, electronics, and sustainable technologies. The expected outcomes of 2-5× improvement in sample efficiency and >95% feasible success rate would translate to substantial time and cost savings in real-world materials research. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications beyond materials science, including robotics, drug design, and causal inference. The proposal directly addresses the pressing need for more efficient experimental design in scientific domains, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals. The open-source release of the implementation and datasets would further amplify the impact by enabling adoption across the scientific community. The educational value through documentation and tutorials would help bridge the gap between machine learning research and experimental science practice. Overall, the potential for transformative impact on how materials discovery is conducted is substantial."
