    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on responsibly building multimodal foundational models by proposing a proactive approach to enhance reliability and sustainability. The KnoWDyPre framework incorporates both knowledge-guided contrastive learning and dynamic dataset curation as outlined in the original idea. The proposal thoroughly integrates concepts from the literature review, citing relevant works like Perry et al.'s dynamic knowledge integration, Pan et al.'s knowledge-based CLIP, and Hu et al.'s retrieval-augmented visual-language pre-training. The methodology section provides detailed algorithmic steps that operationalize the core concepts from both the task description and research idea. The only minor inconsistency is that some references in the proposal (e.g., Anon. 2023, 2024, 2025) appear to be placeholders rather than actual citations from the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated and structured in a logical, easy-to-follow manner. The introduction clearly establishes the background, problem statement, and research objectives. The methodology section provides detailed algorithmic steps with mathematical formulations that make the approach concrete and implementable. The expected outcomes and impact sections effectively communicate the anticipated results and significance. The proposal uses appropriate technical terminology consistently throughout. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for linking KG entities to images could be more precisely defined, (2) some mathematical notations (e.g., the function f in the KGC loss) could be more explicitly defined, and (3) the relationship between the adversarial filtering component and the dynamic dataset curation could be more clearly delineated. Despite these minor issues, the overall clarity of the proposal is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by synergizing two key components - knowledge-guided contrastive learning and dynamic dataset curation - into a unified framework specifically designed to address reliability and sustainability challenges proactively during pre-training. While individual elements draw from existing work (e.g., knowledge-enhanced pre-training from Pan et al. and Perry et al., dynamic data management concepts), their integration and application to the specific problem of enhancing reliability and sustainability in multimodal models represents a fresh approach. The Knowledge Consistency Score and its use in dynamic curation during pre-training appears to be a novel contribution. However, the proposal does not introduce fundamentally new algorithmic techniques; rather, it cleverly combines and adapts existing methods toward an important goal. The novelty lies more in the holistic framework and its application than in revolutionary new technical components."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-defined methodology and rigorous formulations. The Knowledge-Guided Contrastive learning objective is mathematically formalized with clear loss functions. The dynamic dataset curation approach is systematically described with specific scoring mechanisms. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics that directly measure the claims about reliability and sustainability. The proposal is grounded in established theoretical foundations from contrastive learning, knowledge graph integration, and adversarial techniques. The authors acknowledge potential limitations, such as dependence on KG quality and computational overhead. The only minor weaknesses are: (1) some assumptions about the effectiveness of the Knowledge Consistency Score need further validation, and (2) the exact implementation details of the adversarial filtering component could be more thoroughly specified. Overall, the technical approach is well-justified and builds logically on prior work."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, it builds upon existing architectures (CLIP, BLIP) and leverages available resources (Wikidata, public image-text datasets). The authors plan to adapt open-source frameworks, which increases practicality. The evaluation uses standard benchmarks and metrics. However, several aspects present moderate feasibility concerns: (1) The computational overhead of KG linking and consistency scoring during pre-training could potentially offset the sustainability gains from dataset pruning; (2) Creating high-quality multimodal knowledge graphs with sufficient coverage is non-trivial; (3) The dynamic curation process adds complexity to the training loop that may require significant engineering effort; (4) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of defining and measuring 'harm' comprehensively. While these challenges don't render the approach impractical, they do require careful consideration and may necessitate compromises or simplifications during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses critical challenges in multimodal AI that have substantial real-world implications. By tackling hallucinations, bias, and computational inefficiency proactively during pre-training, the research could significantly advance responsible AI development. The potential impact spans multiple domains: (1) In healthcare, more factually grounded and fair models could enable safer diagnostic assistance; (2) In robotics and autonomous systems, improved reliability could accelerate safe deployment; (3) For creative industries, reduced bias in generative outputs could lead to more inclusive content creation. The sustainability aspect is particularly significant given the growing environmental concerns around large-scale AI training. If successful in achieving the targeted 30-40% reduction in computational costs while maintaining or improving performance, the approach could influence industry practices toward more efficient model development. The proposal also contributes methodologically by establishing a new paradigm for knowledge-driven, dynamically curated pre-training that could influence future research directions. While the significance is high, it depends on the actual magnitude of improvements achieved in practice."
