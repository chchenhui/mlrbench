    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the vulnerability of generative models to adversarial attacks, which is explicitly mentioned in the task's topics. The proposal builds upon randomized smoothing techniques from the literature review (particularly papers 1, 2, and 7) and extends them to conditional generative models as outlined in the research idea. The methodology section thoroughly develops the concept presented in the idea, including the theoretical certificates, adaptive noise calibration, and implementation across different generative architectures. The proposal also acknowledges limitations and future work that align with the broader safety concerns mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical concepts are explained with appropriate mathematical formalism, making the approach understandable. The methodology section is particularly strong, with clear subsections that detail the theoretical framework, implementation strategies, and experimental design. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for aggregating outputs in different domains could be more precisely defined, (2) some of the mathematical notation in the adaptive noise calibration section assumes background knowledge that might not be immediately accessible, and (3) the relationship between the theoretical certificates and practical implementation could be more explicitly connected."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. While randomized smoothing has been applied to classification tasks and even to some GANs (as noted in the literature review), the extension to modern conditional generative models like diffusion models and large language models represents a novel contribution. The adaptive noise scheduling and gradient-based noise calibration techniques are innovative approaches to balance robustness and generation quality. The theoretical certificates for bounding Wasserstein distances in output distributions are also novel contributions. However, the core technique of randomized smoothing itself is not new, and some of the implementation strategies build upon existing work in the field, which slightly reduces the novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical framework for randomized smoothing is well-established in the literature, and the extensions to generative models are logically derived. The theoretical certificates (Theorems 1 and 2) provide a rigorous basis for the approach. However, there are some potential gaps in the technical development: (1) the assumptions about the Lipschitz constants of generative models may be difficult to verify in practice, (2) the approximation of the expectation by sampling might introduce errors that aren't fully accounted for in the theoretical analysis, and (3) the adaptive noise calibration approach, while innovative, would benefit from more rigorous justification of its effectiveness. The experimental design is comprehensive, but some of the evaluation metrics (particularly for measuring generation quality) could be more precisely defined."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents moderate feasibility challenges. On the positive side, the randomized smoothing technique itself is well-established and has been implemented for various models. The experimental design is thorough and realistic. However, several significant challenges affect feasibility: (1) The computational overhead of generating multiple samples for each input could be prohibitive for large models like diffusion models and LLMs, potentially requiring substantial computational resources; (2) Calculating or estimating Lipschitz constants for complex generative models is notoriously difficult; (3) The adaptive noise calibration techniques, while promising, may require extensive hyperparameter tuning to work effectively; (4) The aggregation of outputs, especially for text generation, presents complex challenges that might not be easily solved with the proposed methods. The proposal acknowledges some of these limitations but doesn't fully address how they will be overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the safety of generative AI systems, which is highly significant given the rapid deployment of these technologies in sensitive domains. Providing certified robustness guarantees for generative models would be a major advancement in AI safety, directly addressing the vulnerability concerns highlighted in the task description. The potential impact spans multiple domains, including healthcare, legal services, and security systems, where robustness against adversarial manipulation is crucial. The theoretical framework could establish foundations for future research and industry standards. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's focus on both theoretical guarantees and practical implementations, making it relevant to both academic research and real-world applications. The work could substantially contribute to building more trustworthy AI systems, a pressing need in the field."
