    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing multiple key concerns highlighted in the Safe Generative AI Workshop. It directly tackles bias and fairness issues in generated content, which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest. The proposal also addresses the workshop's concern about generative AI in scientific discoveries, focusing on preventing harmful biases that could lead to inequitable research outcomes. The proactive approach to debiasing before problems manifest aligns with the safety-first emphasis of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other topics mentioned like adversarial attacks or privacy concerns, though it thoroughly covers the bias/fairness dimension."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear three-part framework: (1) using causal inference on knowledge graphs to detect biasing factors, (2) implementing counterfactually-aware fine-tuning or prompting strategies, and (3) evaluating effectiveness with novel metrics. The motivation and expected outcomes are clearly stated. The only minor ambiguities lie in the specifics of how the counterfactually-aware fine-tuning would be implemented technically, and what exact metrics would be used to measure 'diversity and novelty' of scientific outputs. These details would need further elaboration in a full proposal, but the overall approach is quite clear and well-structured."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong originality in several ways. First, the focus on proactive rather than reactive debiasing is an innovative shift in approach. Second, the application of causal inference techniques to knowledge graphs derived from scientific literature for bias detection represents a novel methodological contribution. Third, the combination of counterfactually-aware fine-tuning with scientific discovery is relatively unexplored. While individual components (causal inference, knowledge graphs, debiasing) exist in the literature, their integration specifically for scientific discovery contexts and the proactive orientation make this approach notably innovative. It's not entirely unprecedented as debiasing techniques exist, but the specific application and methodology appear fresh."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. Building comprehensive knowledge graphs from scientific literature that capture subtle biases is technically demanding and time-intensive. Causal inference on these complex graphs presents additional challenges, particularly in identifying true causal relationships versus correlations. The counterfactually-aware fine-tuning would require significant computational resources and expertise. Developing meaningful metrics to evaluate diversity and novelty in scientific outputs is also non-trivial. While none of these challenges are insurmountable with current technology, they collectively represent substantial implementation hurdles. The proposal would benefit from more specific details on how these challenges would be addressed, particularly regarding the computational requirements and data needs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem at the intersection of AI safety and scientific progress. If successful, it could have far-reaching impacts on how AI is used in scientific discovery, potentially leading to more equitable research outcomes and accelerating innovation in previously neglected areas. The significance is heightened by the increasing adoption of generative AI in scientific workflows, making bias mitigation increasingly urgent. The approach could establish new standards for responsible AI use in science, potentially influencing policy and practice across disciplines. The proactive nature of the debiasing framework also means it could prevent harmful biases before they become entrenched in scientific literature, which is particularly valuable given how difficult it is to correct established scientific biases retrospectively."
