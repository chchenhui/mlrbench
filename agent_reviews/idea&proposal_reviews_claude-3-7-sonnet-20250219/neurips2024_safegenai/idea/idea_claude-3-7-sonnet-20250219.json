    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing one of the explicitly mentioned topics: 'Overconfidence in the reliability of generated content.' The proposal directly tackles the problem of hallucinatory confidence in generative models, which is a significant safety concern highlighted in the workshop description. The idea also indirectly addresses other topics from the task description, including the generation of harmful content (by reducing misleading confident assertions) and ethical implications of deploying generative AI (by making models more transparent about their limitations). The proposal is highly relevant to the workshop's focus on AI safety concerns related to generative models in research and applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, clearly articulating both the problem (hallucinatory confidence) and the proposed solution (a dual-phase approach involving confidence calibration and verification). The motivation section effectively establishes the importance of the problem, and the main idea section outlines a concrete approach with specific components. The only minor ambiguities relate to the exact implementation details of the 'specialized datasets of known unknowns' and how the 'uncertainty-aware training objectives' would be formulated mathematically. While these technical specifics would naturally be elaborated in a full proposal, the core concept is well-defined and immediately understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its specific focus on hallucinatory confidence rather than just factual accuracy, which represents a shift from most current approaches. The dual-phase approach combining confidence calibration with verification is a fresh perspective, especially the concept of creating specialized 'known unknowns' datasets. However, some components build upon existing research in uncertainty quantification, confidence calibration, and fact verification systems. The integration of these components with human-in-the-loop feedback for generative models specifically represents an innovative combination rather than a completely groundbreaking new concept. The approach extends and combines existing techniques in a novel way rather than introducing entirely new methodological paradigms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Creating datasets of 'known unknowns' is challenging but achievable, especially with careful curation and expert input. The confidence calibration framework builds on existing work in uncertainty estimation. The verification system using multiple knowledge sources is technically implementable, though triangulating information across diverse sources presents engineering challenges. The human-in-the-loop component adds complexity but is practical with proper interface design. The main implementation challenges would be in effectively integrating these components and ensuring the calibration transfers to real-world scenarios beyond the training distribution. While ambitious, none of the proposed components require technological breakthroughs, making the overall approach feasible with sufficient resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI safety with potentially high impact. Hallucinatory confidence in generative models represents a significant risk factor when these systems are deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal contexts, and scientific research. By tackling this specific issue, the research could substantially improve the safety and trustworthiness of generative AI systems. The approach could lead to models that are more transparent about their limitations, reducing the risk of harmful decision-making based on overconfident but incorrect outputs. This work directly addresses a key concern in the responsible development of AI systems and could influence how generative models are designed, evaluated, and deployed across various applications, making it highly significant to both the research community and society."
