    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on combining scientific and ML modeling paradigms, proposing differentiable scientific models as adaptive layers within neural networks. The proposal builds upon the literature review's key works, particularly referencing Raissi et al. (2019), Fan & Wang (2023), Akhare et al. (2024), and Shen et al. (2023). It addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, including model interpretability, data efficiency, and uncertainty quantification. The methodology section clearly outlines how scientific models will be embedded as differentiable layers, enabling end-to-end optimization of both scientific parameters and ML weights, which directly implements the core idea presented in the research idea document."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, including mathematical formulations of the scientific model differentiation, hybrid network architecture, and loss function design. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying data sources, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for backpropagation through complex scientific solvers could be more detailed, (2) the balance between physical consistency and data-driven adaptation could be more explicitly addressed, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'operator splitting techniques') are mentioned without sufficient explanation. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible but has minor areas that could be further clarified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to hybrid modeling. While differentiable physics-informed neural networks exist in the literature (as noted in Raissi et al., 2019), this proposal innovates by treating both ML weights AND scientific model parameters as jointly learnable variables in an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. This represents a meaningful advancement beyond existing approaches that typically fix scientific model parameters. The proposal also introduces novel applications in climate science and biomedicine where this approach could be transformative. The self-calibrating nature of the proposed models, which adapt to real-world data while preserving physical consistency, represents a fresh perspective on hybrid modeling. However, some components build incrementally on existing work (e.g., DiffHybrid-UQ), which slightly tempers the overall novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in established theoretical principles. The mathematical formulation of differentiable scientific models is technically correct, and the proposed loss function appropriately balances data fidelity with physical consistency. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in gradient computation for highly nonlinear or stiff scientific models, (2) there's limited discussion of convergence guarantees when jointly optimizing scientific and ML parameters, and (3) the uncertainty quantification approach could be more thoroughly developed. While the proposal cites relevant literature and builds on established methods, these gaps in addressing technical challenges slightly reduce its soundness score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable computational requirements. The use of existing tools like JAX for automatic differentiation and PyTorch for ML training is practical. The experimental design across three domains (synthetic, climate science, and biomedical) is ambitious but manageable. However, several feasibility concerns exist: (1) differentiating through complex numerical solvers (especially for 3D fluid dynamics) may present significant computational challenges not fully addressed, (2) the proposal mentions using ERA5 reanalysis data and WRF models, which are computationally intensive and may require substantial resources, (3) patient-specific cerebral aneurysm simulations typically require specialized expertise and access to clinical data, which may be difficult to obtain. While the core methodology is implementable, these practical challenges somewhat limit the overall feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in hybrid modeling and has potential for substantial impact across multiple domains. By enabling scientific models to adapt to real-world data while preserving physical consistency, it could significantly advance fields like climate science, biomedicine, and materials science. The expected 15-20% reduction in out-of-domain MSE compared to fixed-physics hybrids would represent a meaningful improvement in model generalization. The approach could democratize complex modeling by reducing the expertise required for manual recalibration of scientific models. The proposal's emphasis on interpretability through physically meaningful learned parameters addresses a key challenge in ML adoption for scientific applications. The potential to transform hybrid learning from a niche technique to a mainstream standard across disciplines demonstrates its high significance. The open-sourcing of differentiable physics libraries would further amplify the impact by enabling broader adoption."
