    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on efficient and accessible foundation models for biological discovery. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the task description: efficient fine-tuning and adaptation of biological foundation models, lab-in-the-loop iterative approaches, and making complex ML models accessible to non-experts. The proposal specifically targets the gap between ML research and wet lab use by offering a lightweight adaptation method that requires minimal computational resources, which is a central concern of the workshop. The idea also incorporates uncertainty modeling to guide experiment prioritization, another topic explicitly mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating the problem, proposed solution, and evaluation approach concisely. The concept of prompt-based iterative adaptation is well-defined, and the technical approach involving learnable parameter vectors is clearly explained. The Bayesian framework for uncertainty estimation is mentioned, though more details on its implementation would enhance clarity further. The evaluation plan specifies datasets and comparison baselines, providing a concrete roadmap. While the overall concept is well-articulated, some technical details about how the prompts interact with the foundation model architecture and the specific mechanisms of the Bayesian framework could be elaborated for complete clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by applying prompt-based adaptation specifically to biological foundation models in a lab-in-the-loop setting. While prompt-based methods and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (like LoRA) exist in NLP and other domains, their application to biological discovery with experimental feedback loops represents a fresh approach. The integration of Bayesian uncertainty estimation with prompts to guide experiment prioritization adds an innovative dimension. However, the core technical approach builds upon existing prompt-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic innovations, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and resources. Prompt-tuning methods are well-established, and the proposal to train only a small fraction of parameters (>0.1%) is realistic and aligned with existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches. The evaluation on real-world datasets like AAV capsid design is concrete and achievable. The approach specifically addresses computational constraints faced by biological labs, making implementation practical even with limited resources. The integration with experimental feedback loops is feasible given the iterative nature of biological research. The proposal doesn't require new hardware or theoretical breakthroughs, but rather cleverly combines existing techniques to solve a practical problem."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant problem in the democratization of ML for biological discovery. By reducing computational requirements and enabling non-experts to adapt complex models, it could substantially lower barriers to adoption for smaller labs with limited resources. The potential impact on accelerating discovery cycles in protein engineering and other biological domains is considerable. The approach could enable more dynamic collaboration between ML and biomedical researchers, potentially leading to faster scientific discoveries. While the significance is high within the biological ML community, it doesn't represent a paradigm shift that would transform the entire field of machine learning or biology, which prevents it from receiving the highest significance score."
