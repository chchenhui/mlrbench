        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses preference-based learning in the context of multi-objective optimization, which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest in the workshop. The proposal connects theory to practice by identifying real-world applications (robotic manipulators, autonomous vehicles, design engines) that can benefit from preference feedback, which is the second broad objective of the workshop. The idea also bridges different communities (evolutionary algorithms, Gaussian processes, active learning) where preference-based learning plays a role, which aligns with the first broad objective of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it could have more explicitly connected to some of the other communities mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation is concisely stated, highlighting the limitations of traditional Pareto-front methods. The main components of AP-MOO are clearly articulated in a step-by-step process: (1) sampling candidate solutions, (2) selecting informative pairs via active learning, (3) updating the GP model, and (4) biasing the next generation. The evaluation plan is also well-defined, mentioning benchmark functions and a specific robotic grasp-planning task with multiple objectives. The only minor ambiguities are in the details of how the GP surrogate over the objective-weight simplex works and how exactly the active learning component selects the most informative pairs, which would benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing techniques in a potentially innovative way. The integration of active preference learning with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and Gaussian process modeling creates a novel framework. The use of expected information gain to select query pairs is not entirely new but is applied thoughtfully in this context. While preference-based optimization and active learning have been explored separately, their combination with a GP surrogate over the objective-weight simplex appears to offer a fresh approach. However, similar approaches combining preference learning with MOO exist in the literature, which somewhat limits the claim of groundbreaking originality. The idea builds upon existing concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible. All the components mentioned (evolutionary algorithms, Gaussian processes, active learning) are well-established techniques with existing implementations. The evaluation plan on benchmark functions is straightforward, and even the robotic grasp-planning task is realistic given current technology. The approach of iteratively querying users and updating models is well-understood and implementable. The computational requirements should be manageable, especially since the preference queries are meant to be sparse. The only potential challenges might be in the user study aspects (getting consistent human feedback) and in efficiently implementing the GP over the objective-weight simplex, but these are not insurmountable obstacles. The research team would need expertise in both evolutionary algorithms and Bayesian optimization, but this combination is not uncommon."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is substantial. Multi-objective optimization problems are ubiquitous in real-world applications, and the current approaches often struggle with user preference integration. By reducing the cognitive load on users while still finding solutions aligned with their preferences, this work could have broad impact across robotics, autonomous systems, design optimization, and other fields mentioned in the task description. The expected outcomes of faster convergence to user-preferred optima with fewer queries directly addresses efficiency concerns in human-in-the-loop systems. The approach also bridges the gap between theoretical preference models and practical applications, which aligns with the workshop's goals. While not revolutionary, this work could significantly advance the state of practice in preference-based optimization."
