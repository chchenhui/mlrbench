        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It focuses on preference-based learning in robotics, which is explicitly mentioned as a relevant topic in the workshop description. The proposal directly addresses how to incorporate human preference feedback to improve robotic manipulation, which matches the workshop's goal of connecting theory to practice in preference-based learning. The idea also connects different communities (robotics, reinforcement learning, and human-computer interaction), which aligns with the workshop's first objective. The proposal specifically mentions using preference comparisons rather than numerical values, which is the core principle highlighted in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (costly expert demonstrations), the proposed solution (hybrid framework combining preference-based learning with active imitation learning), and the specific innovations (diversity-driven sampling and integration with offline RL). The methodology is well-defined, explaining how the system will work from initial learning to refinement through preferences. The experimental validation approach is also clearly outlined. There are only minor ambiguities around the exact implementation details of the diversity-driven sampling strategy and how the preference-derived rewards will be mathematically formulated, but these are reasonable omissions given the space constraints of a research proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing approaches in a new way. While preference-based learning and imitation learning are established fields, the integration of active learning to select maximally informative trajectory pairs for human feedback represents a fresh approach. The diversity-driven sampling strategy appears to be a novel contribution. However, the core concept of using human preferences to guide robotic learning has been explored before, as acknowledged in the task description which mentions robotics as an area where preference-based learning has already yielded promising results. The proposal builds upon existing work rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. All the components mentioned (imitation learning, preference-based learning, reinforcement learning) are established techniques with existing implementations. The proposal targets specific robotic manipulation tasks (pick-and-place, tool use) that are common benchmarks in robotics research. The approach of starting with suboptimal demonstrations and refining through preferences is practical and addresses real-world constraints. The main implementation challenges would likely be in the integration of the different learning components and ensuring efficient human feedback collection, but these are manageable challenges rather than fundamental barriers. The proposal also wisely limits its scope to specific manipulation tasks rather than attempting to solve all robotic learning problems."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant problem in robotics: the high cost and limited scalability of expert demonstration collection. If successful, this approach could substantially reduce the barriers to deploying robots in new environments and for new tasks. The potential applications in healthcare and logistics mentioned in the proposal represent high-impact domains where improved robotic capabilities could provide substantial societal benefits. The work also contributes to the broader field of preference-based learning by providing concrete methods for active sampling and integration with offline RL. While not completely revolutionary, the impact could be substantial in making robotic systems more adaptable and easier to deploy, especially in domains where explicit reward engineering is challenging."
