    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of connecting theory to practice by developing a framework that combines multi-objective optimization with preference-based reinforcement learning for clinical decision support. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the multi-objective nature of healthcare decisions highlighted in the research idea, focusing on the balance between efficacy, side effects, cost, and quality of life. It also extensively references and builds upon the literature review, citing many of the papers mentioned and addressing the key challenges identified, particularly the challenges of balancing multiple objectives, eliciting accurate preferences, and ensuring interpretability. The methodology section clearly outlines how the MOPBRL-H framework will work, with detailed mathematical formulations that are consistent with both the research idea and the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined, and the technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical notation. The MOPBRL-H framework is presented step-by-step, making it easy to understand the overall process. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-specified. However, there are a few areas where additional clarity would be beneficial, such as more detailed explanation of how the preference model would handle potential inconsistencies in clinician preferences, and more specific details on the implementation of the multi-objective policy optimization algorithms. The proposal also contains some complex technical concepts that might benefit from additional explanation or examples for readers less familiar with MORL or PBRL."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of multi-objective reinforcement learning with preference-based learning specifically tailored for healthcare applications. While both MORL and PBRL exist separately, and some recent work has started exploring their combination (as noted in the literature review), the proposal's innovation lies in developing a comprehensive framework that learns distributions over objective weights from clinician preferences and uses these to guide the search for Pareto-optimal policies in healthcare contexts. The Bayesian approach to inferring weight distributions from preferences is particularly innovative, as is the focus on generating diverse sets of policies that reflect the uncertainty in clinician preferences. The proposal also introduces novel evaluation metrics specific to healthcare applications. However, some individual components build directly on existing methods (e.g., preference models, MORL algorithms), which is appropriate but slightly limits the overall novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and soundness. The problem formulation as a Multi-Objective MDP is mathematically precise and appropriate for the healthcare context. The preference modeling approach using the Bradley-Terry model (or extensions) is well-established in the literature. The Bayesian inference framework for updating weight distributions is theoretically sound, and the proposed policy optimization strategies are well-grounded in reinforcement learning theory. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that will allow for meaningful comparison. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and challenges, such as the need for simulation environments and the challenges of real-world data. The extensive references to recent literature further strengthen the technical foundations of the approach. Overall, the methodology is comprehensive, well-justified, and builds appropriately on established techniques while extending them in novel ways."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, particularly for the simulation-based components. The use of existing physiological simulators like the UVA/Padova T1D simulator provides a solid foundation for the diabetes management case study. The step-by-step methodology is clearly defined and implementable with current technology and methods. However, there are some aspects that may present challenges to feasibility. The Bayesian inference for learning weight distributions may be computationally intensive, especially as the number of objectives increases. The proposal acknowledges the potential extension to offline EMR data but correctly notes the significant challenges this would entail. The need for simulated clinician preferences is a practical approach but may not fully capture the complexity of real clinical decision-making. The timeline for implementation is not explicitly discussed, which makes it difficult to assess whether all components could be completed within a reasonable research timeframe. Overall, while the core research is feasible, some of the more ambitious aspects may require significant resources or simplifications."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need in healthcare AI: developing decision support systems that can handle multiple competing objectives while learning directly from clinician expertise. If successful, this research could significantly impact clinical practice by providing more personalized, trustworthy, and interpretable decision support for chronic disease management. The potential benefits include improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and more efficient clinical workflows. From a methodological perspective, the work contributes novel techniques at the intersection of MORL, PBRL, and healthcare AI that could be applicable to other domains with multi-objective decision-making under uncertainty. The proposal directly addresses several key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly around balancing multiple objectives, preference elicitation, and interpretability/trust. The alignment with the workshop's goals of connecting theory to practice and bringing together different communities is excellent. The significance is further enhanced by the focus on chronic disease management, which affects millions of patients globally and represents a substantial healthcare burden."
