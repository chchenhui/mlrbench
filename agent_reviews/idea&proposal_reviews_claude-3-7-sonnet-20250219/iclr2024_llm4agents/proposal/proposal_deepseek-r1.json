    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on memory mechanisms and reasoning/planning for LLM agents. The dual-pathway semantic memory architecture with forgetting mechanisms perfectly matches the initial research idea of creating a biologically-inspired memory system that balances retention and forgetting. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, particularly building upon works like MemoryBank (Zhong et al., 2023), RecallM (Kynoch et al., 2023), and MeMo (Zanzotto et al., 2025). It addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as catastrophic forgetting, balancing memory retention, and efficient memory management. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes unlearning approaches, the proposal focuses more on adaptive forgetting rather than explicit unlearning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The technical details of the Semantic Memory with Adaptive Forgetting (SMAF) architecture are explained thoroughly, including mathematical formulations for the forgetting mechanism and reinforcement learning approach. The experimental design section provides comprehensive information about datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact implementation details of the hierarchical semantic network could be more specific, (2) the integration between the semantic memory and the LLM's internal representations could be elaborated further, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly define how the system will be evaluated against human-like forgetting patterns."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements. The dual-pathway architecture that integrates hierarchical semantic networks with adaptive forgetting mechanisms offers a fresh approach to memory management in LLM agents. The use of reinforcement learning to optimize forgetting parameters based on task performance is particularly innovative. The proposal also introduces a novel combination of metrics (recency, relevance, and importance) to guide the forgetting process. However, while the individual components are creative, many build upon existing approaches in the literature. The hierarchical semantic network shares similarities with knowledge graphs, and the forgetting mechanism draws from established cognitive models. The proposal acknowledges its relationship to prior work like MemoryBank and RecallM, indicating evolutionary rather than revolutionary advancement. The integration of these components into a cohesive system represents innovation, but not a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the forgetting mechanism are well-defined, with clear equations for recency, relevance, importance, and the combined forgetting score. The reinforcement learning approach for optimizing forgetting parameters is grounded in established techniques like proximal policy optimization. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies will help isolate the contributions of individual components. The proposal is built upon solid cognitive science principles regarding human memory systems. However, there are some areas where additional rigor could be beneficial: (1) the proposal could provide more detailed justification for the specific form of the forgetting score function, (2) the reward function for reinforcement learning could be more thoroughly analyzed for potential biases or limitations, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly address potential failure modes or edge cases in the semantic network construction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The implementation of the semantic network and forgetting mechanism appears achievable with current technologies and methods. The use of pre-trained encoders like Sentence-BERT for embedding is practical. The experimental design utilizes existing datasets and establishes clear evaluation metrics. However, there are several implementation challenges that could affect feasibility: (1) training the reinforcement learning policy to optimize forgetting parameters across diverse tasks may require substantial computational resources and careful hyperparameter tuning, (2) the hierarchical integration of new concepts into the semantic network could face scalability issues with very large knowledge bases, (3) the proposal aims for a 15-20% improvement over baselines, which is ambitious given the complexity of the problem, and (4) the human evaluation component will require careful design and execution to ensure reliable results. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the proposal infeasible, but rather indicate areas requiring careful attention during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical limitation in current LLM agents: their inability to effectively manage memory over extended interactions. This is a fundamental challenge that impacts numerous applications of LLM agents, from conversational assistants to autonomous systems. The expected outcomes—improved task success rate, reduced memory footprint, and alignment with human-like forgetting patterns—would represent significant advancements in the field. The proposal has both theoretical and practical significance: theoretically, it bridges cognitive science and machine learning to develop more human-like memory systems; practically, it could enhance AI assistants in domains like healthcare, education, and autonomous systems where long-term coherence is essential. The potential for reduced computational costs through efficient memory management is particularly significant for deploying LLM agents on resource-constrained devices. While the proposal may not completely solve the memory management problem, it offers a substantial step forward that could influence future research directions and applications in the field."
