        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric approaches for foundation models, particularly in the areas of model-assisted dataset construction, quality signals, and handling dataset drifts. The UMC pipeline implements the core idea of uncertainty-driven curation to guide human annotators toward high-impact examples, exactly as outlined in the research idea. The proposal also incorporates concepts from the literature review, such as data quality concerns (Zha et al. 2023), human-in-the-loop approaches (Saveliev et al. 2025), and ethical considerations (Xu et al. 2024). The methodology section provides a comprehensive implementation plan that addresses all aspects of the original idea, including the ensemble-based uncertainty estimation, clustering, multi-armed bandit allocation, and iterative retraining."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and numbered, making the goals easy to understand. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of each component in the UMC pipeline, including mathematical formulations for uncertainty scoring, clustering, and the multi-armed bandit allocation. The experimental design outlines specific data domains, baselines, evaluation metrics, and implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the newly trained foundation model M* back into the ensemble of specialists could be more explicitly described, (2) the interface between clustering and bandit allocation could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical details about the annotation interface are somewhat vague. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing techniques in a novel way. The integration of ensemble-based uncertainty estimation, clustering for batch annotation, and multi-armed bandit allocation into a cohesive pipeline for data curation represents a fresh approach. The use of inter-model disagreement as a signal for identifying informative samples is particularly innovative. However, many of the individual components (uncertainty sampling, active learning, human-in-the-loop annotation) are well-established in the literature. The proposal acknowledges this by citing prior work on uncertainty sampling (Gal et al. 2017) and bandit-based active learning (Hazan et al. 2016). While the combination and application to multi-domain foundation models is novel, the core techniques themselves are extensions of existing approaches rather than groundbreaking new methods. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly highlighting what specific aspects of the UMC pipeline differentiate it from existing model-assisted curation approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on well-established theoretical foundations. The uncertainty estimation approach using ensemble disagreement and entropy is mathematically rigorous and well-justified. The multi-armed bandit formulation for balancing exploration and exploitation is appropriate and correctly specified with the UCB algorithm. The clustering approach for grouping similar hard cases is sensible and well-motivated. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component. The implementation details are specific and realistic. However, there are a few areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the choice of Î± in the uncertainty formula could benefit from theoretical justification rather than treating it as a hyperparameter, (2) the proposal could more explicitly address potential failure modes or edge cases in the pipeline, and (3) statistical significance testing for the expected outcomes is not mentioned. Overall, the technical approach is sound and well-founded, with only minor gaps in the theoretical justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation details. The computational requirements (NVIDIA A100 GPUs, foundation models of 300M-1B parameters) are substantial but within reach of many research labs. The iterative approach with 10 rounds and 10K samples per round is manageable. The ensemble size of 5 specialists per modality strikes a reasonable balance between diversity and computational cost. The proposal also specifies concrete evaluation metrics and baselines that can be implemented with existing tools and datasets. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) coordinating human annotators for 10 rounds of feedback could be logistically challenging and time-consuming, (2) developing an effective interactive annotation interface with all the described features would require significant engineering effort, and (3) the proposal assumes access to domain specialists across multiple modalities, which may not be readily available. While these challenges are not insurmountable, they do represent non-trivial implementation hurdles that could affect the timeline and resources required for the project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in the development of foundation models: the efficient curation of high-quality, diverse training data. By potentially reducing annotation costs by 30-50% while improving domain robustness and coverage, the UMC approach could have substantial impact on how large-scale datasets are constructed. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on data-centric approaches for foundation models. The expected outcomes include not just performance improvements but also practical tools (code, annotation interface components) that could be adopted by the broader community. The ethical and governance benefits, including provenance metadata and content flagging, address important concerns in responsible AI development. The approach is also generalizable across modalities (vision, language, multi-modal) and could be integrated with existing data infrastructure. While the impact may not be transformative in terms of fundamentally changing how AI systems work, it represents a significant advancement in the practical aspects of dataset construction that could enable more robust and versatile foundation models."
