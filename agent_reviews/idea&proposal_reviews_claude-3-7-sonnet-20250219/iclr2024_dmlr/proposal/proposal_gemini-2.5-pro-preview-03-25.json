        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric approaches for foundation models by proposing the UMC framework for model-assisted dataset construction. The proposal incorporates key elements from the original idea, including the ensemble-based uncertainty estimation, clustering of uncertain samples, human-in-the-loop curation, and multi-armed bandit allocation. It also thoroughly integrates insights from the literature review, citing relevant papers like Zha et al. (2023a, 2023b), Xu et al. (2024), and others to establish the theoretical foundation. The proposal covers all major topics mentioned in the task description, including construction of datasets from unlabeled data, model-assisted dataset construction, quality signals, dataset drift, and data curation with HCI components."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The UMC framework is explained in detail, with specific mathematical formulations for uncertainty metrics and the MAB algorithm. The conceptual flow diagram helps visualize the iterative process. The research objectives, experimental design, and evaluation metrics are all well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the human-in-the-loop interface could be more specific, (2) the relationship between the ensemble models and the foundation model being trained could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some technical details about how the clustering will be performed on diverse data types could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by combining several existing techniques in a novel way. The integration of ensemble-based uncertainty estimation, clustering for contextual relevance, interactive human curation, and MAB-based resource allocation into a cohesive framework for multi-domain dataset curation represents a fresh approach. The use of model uncertainty to guide human annotation efforts across diverse domains is particularly innovative. However, many of the individual components (active learning, uncertainty sampling, MAB allocation) are established techniques in the literature. The novelty lies primarily in their integration and application to the specific problem of multi-domain foundation model dataset curation, rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms or methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-established theoretical foundations. The uncertainty quantification methods (predictive entropy, ensemble disagreement) are mathematically well-defined and grounded in information theory. The MAB formulation for resource allocation is rigorous and appropriate for the exploration-exploitation trade-off described. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear baselines, evaluation metrics, and controlled comparisons. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The only minor limitations are: (1) potential challenges in scaling the approach to extremely large datasets are not fully addressed, (2) the impact of different clustering algorithms on the framework's performance could be explored more thoroughly, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more discussion on how to handle potential feedback loops where model biases influence the selection of uncertain samples."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation plans. The authors propose using existing pre-trained foundation models, publicly available datasets, and standard ML libraries, which makes the technical implementation practical. The simulation-based evaluation strategy allows for controlled experiments without requiring massive annotation resources initially. However, there are some feasibility challenges: (1) creating truly diverse multi-domain datasets with sufficient coverage may be resource-intensive, (2) the computational cost of running ensemble models on large-scale data could be substantial, (3) implementing an effective interactive curation interface that presents uncertainty information in an intuitive way for human annotators may be complex, and (4) the iterative retraining of foundation models could be computationally expensive. While these challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, they do represent significant practical hurdles that would need to be carefully managed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the development of foundation models: the efficient curation of high-quality, multi-domain datasets. If successful, the UMC framework could significantly reduce annotation costs (the authors target 30-50% reduction) while improving dataset quality and domain coverage. This would have substantial impact on the field by: (1) making foundation model development more accessible to researchers with limited resources, (2) enabling the expansion of foundation models to new domains beyond vision and language, (3) improving model robustness and generalization through better data curation, and (4) advancing data-centric AI methodologies. The proposal directly aligns with the workshop's goal of bridging dataset-centric methodologies with robust foundation model development. The potential for open-source release of the framework and benchmark datasets further enhances its significance to the research community."
