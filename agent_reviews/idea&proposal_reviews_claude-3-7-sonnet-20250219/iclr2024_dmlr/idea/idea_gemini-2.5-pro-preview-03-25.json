        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses model-assisted dataset construction, quality signals for datasets, and data curation with HCI - all explicitly mentioned in the task topics. The proposal focuses on building scientific datasets for foundation models in domains beyond language and vision (specifically mentioning genomics and materials science), which perfectly matches the workshop's aim to highlight 'data-centric approaches for large-scale foundation models in new domains.' The human-in-the-loop verification process also addresses the ethical considerations and governance aspects mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a clear workflow from initial model training on unlabeled data to expert verification and model refinement. The concept of 'information nuggets' is well-defined in context (with examples provided), and the iterative improvement process is logically structured. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how uncertainty quantification and relevance scoring would be implemented, and what specific metrics would determine data quality. These details would likely be elaborated in a full proposal, but their absence slightly reduces the clarity score from perfect."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. While human-in-the-loop learning and bootstrapping techniques exist, applying them specifically to scientific dataset construction with domain experts is relatively novel. The iterative refinement process that leverages uncertainty quantification to identify valuable data points shows innovation. However, similar approaches have been explored in active learning and semi-supervised learning contexts, which prevents this from receiving the highest novelty score. The application to scientific domains like genomics and materials science adds originality, but the core methodology builds significantly on existing approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed framework is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Foundation models, uncertainty quantification, and HCI interfaces are all established technologies that could be integrated as described. The main implementation challenges would be: (1) designing an efficient interface that minimizes expert time requirements, (2) developing effective uncertainty metrics that identify truly valuable data points, and (3) ensuring the initial model has sufficient capability to identify meaningful information nuggets. These challenges are substantial but surmountable with appropriate expertise and resources. The iterative nature of the approach also allows for gradual refinement rather than requiring perfect implementation from the start."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical bottleneck in applying foundation models to scientific domains - the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. If successful, it could significantly accelerate scientific progress by enabling more powerful AI systems in domains like genomics and materials science. The approach is particularly valuable because it efficiently leverages scarce expert time, potentially reducing the cost and time required to build scientific datasets by orders of magnitude. The significance is enhanced by the framework's potential applicability across multiple scientific domains. It doesn't receive a perfect score only because the impact depends on how well the technical challenges are solved and whether domain experts adopt the approach."
