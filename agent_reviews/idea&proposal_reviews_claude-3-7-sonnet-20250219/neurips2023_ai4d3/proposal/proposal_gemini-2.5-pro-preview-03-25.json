    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses structure-based drug design, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The proposal fully develops the core concept from the research idea, implementing E(3)-equivariant GNNs with hierarchical attention mechanisms for protein-ligand interactions. It thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, building upon works like EquiPocket, EquiCPI, and HAC-Net while addressing the identified challenges of capturing complex 3D interactions, generalization, and interpretability. The proposal maintains consistency throughout, from the theoretical foundations to the experimental design and expected outcomes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical concepts are explained thoroughly, including the mathematical formulations of the E(3)-equivariant layers and attention mechanisms. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the experimental design is detailed. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the transition between atom-level and residue-level attention could be more precisely defined, (2) some technical details of the molecule generation component are less developed compared to the affinity prediction component, and (3) the mathematical notation, while generally clear, occasionally introduces new terms without full explanation (e.g., the transition from layer l to l' in the residue-level attention)."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by integrating E(3)-equivariant GNNs with hierarchical geometric attention mechanisms specifically for structure-based drug design. While both E(3)-equivariant networks and attention mechanisms have been explored separately in the literature (as evidenced by the cited works like EquiPocket, EquiCPI, and HAC-Net), their combination in a hierarchical framework that operates across different structural levels (atom, residue, pocket) represents a novel approach. The proposal also extends beyond mere affinity prediction to molecule generation, which adds to its originality. However, the core technical components (E(3)-equivariance and attention) are adaptations of existing methods rather than fundamentally new algorithms, and the molecule generation component builds on established approaches rather than proposing a completely new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The E(3)-equivariant formulation is mathematically rigorous and correctly preserves the necessary symmetries. The attention mechanisms are properly integrated within the equivariant framework, with careful consideration of how to maintain equivariance/invariance properties. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets (PDBbind), relevant baselines, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. The training procedures and loss functions are standard and appropriate for the tasks. There are minor concerns about the technical details of ensuring equivariance in the hierarchical attention mechanism, particularly at the residue level, and some aspects of the molecule generation approach could benefit from more rigorous formulation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The use of established datasets like PDBbind and standard evaluation metrics makes the experimental validation practical. The model architecture builds upon existing frameworks (EGNN, TFN) which demonstrates implementation feasibility. However, there are several challenges that may impact full feasibility: (1) the computational complexity of E(3)-equivariant networks combined with attention mechanisms could be substantial, potentially requiring significant GPU resources, (2) the hierarchical attention mechanism across different structural levels adds implementation complexity, (3) the molecule generation component, particularly if using reinforcement learning approaches, may face convergence challenges, and (4) the proposal is ambitious in tackling both affinity prediction and molecule generation, which might be better approached sequentially rather than in parallel."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in drug discovery - improving the accuracy of structure-based drug design to reduce the time and cost of bringing new therapeutics to market. If successful, the EGAN model could have substantial impact by: (1) providing more accurate binding affinity predictions to improve virtual screening, (2) generating better-optimized molecules for specific protein targets, (3) offering interpretable insights through attention weights to guide medicinal chemistry, and (4) contributing a novel architectural approach that combines geometric equivariance with hierarchical attention. The work directly addresses key challenges identified in the literature review and has potential applications across multiple stages of drug discovery. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on computational methods without explicit plans for experimental validation of generated molecules, which would strengthen the real-world impact."
