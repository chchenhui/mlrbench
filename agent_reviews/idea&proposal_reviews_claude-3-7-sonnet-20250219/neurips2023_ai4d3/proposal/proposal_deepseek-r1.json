    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses structure-based drug design, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The proposal fully implements the core idea of combining E(3)-equivariant GNNs with hierarchical attention mechanisms for protein-ligand interactions. It builds upon the literature review by incorporating concepts from EquiPocket, EquiCPI, and HAC-Net, addressing the key challenges identified in the review such as capturing complex 3D interactions and improving interpretability. The methodology section thoroughly details how E(3)-equivariance is preserved through steerable kernels and how attention mechanisms are implemented at multiple scales, consistent with the research idea. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal could have more explicitly addressed some of the computational efficiency challenges mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations that explain the E(3)-equivariant layers, attention mechanisms, and decoder architecture. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, making it clear how the model will be validated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for molecule generation could be more thoroughly explained, particularly how the 3D CVAE integrates with the equivariant framework; (2) the transition between the hierarchical attention levels could be more explicitly defined; and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'steerable kernels') might benefit from brief explanations for broader accessibility."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating E(3)-equivariant GNNs with hierarchical attention mechanisms specifically for structure-based drug design. While both E(3)-equivariant networks (EquiPocket, EquiCPI) and attention mechanisms (HAC-Net) have been separately explored in the literature, their combination into a hierarchical framework operating at atomic, residue, and pocket levels represents a novel approach. The dual-task architecture that simultaneously handles affinity prediction and molecule generation is also innovative. However, the core technical components (equivariant layers, attention mechanisms) are adaptations of existing methods rather than fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal builds incrementally on established approaches rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The E(3)-equivariant formulations are mathematically correct and properly preserve rotational and translational symmetries essential for molecular modeling. The hierarchical attention mechanism is logically structured to capture interactions at multiple scales. The loss functions and evaluation metrics are appropriate for the tasks. The experimental design includes proper baselines, cross-validation, and holdout testing to ensure robust evaluation. The data sources (PDBbind, CASF-2016) are standard and suitable for the research objectives. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal could better justify the specific form of the equivariant update equations; (2) more details on how the model handles different atom types and chemical features would enhance rigor; and (3) the statistical significance testing approach for comparing with baselines is not explicitly mentioned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The data sources (PDBbind, CASF-2016) are publicly available, and the preprocessing steps are well-defined and achievable. The model architecture, while complex, builds on established frameworks like E(3)-equivariant GNNs and attention mechanisms that have working implementations. The evaluation metrics and validation protocols are standard in the field. However, several aspects may present challenges: (1) training E(3)-equivariant networks with hierarchical attention could be computationally expensive, potentially requiring significant GPU resources; (2) the dual-task learning approach combining affinity prediction and molecule generation adds complexity to the optimization process; (3) the molecule generation component via 3D CVAE might face challenges in producing chemically valid structures while maintaining equivariance; and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address how it will overcome the computational efficiency challenges mentioned in the literature review."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in drug discovery - improving the accuracy of structure-based drug design to reduce costly experimental trial-and-error. If successful, the research could significantly impact early-stage drug discovery by enabling more precise virtual screening and structure-guided optimization. The expected outcomes are ambitious but reasonable: improving binding affinity prediction beyond state-of-the-art (RMSE < 1.2 pKd) and generating high-quality molecules with good docking scores. The interpretability aspect through attention visualization adds practical value for medicinal chemists. The proposal directly addresses multiple topics from the task description, including molecular representation learning, binding and affinity prediction, and structure-based drug design. However, while the impact on computational drug discovery is clear, the proposal could more explicitly discuss how the improvements would translate to real-world clinical outcomes or drug development timelines, which would strengthen its significance assessment."
