        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description on intrinsically-motivated and open-ended learning. It directly addresses the core challenge of developing autonomous agents that can structure their own learning over time without predefined signals. The proposed co-evolution of intrinsic motivation and goal generation mechanisms speaks directly to the task's emphasis on agents that can 'adaptively create goals and switch between them' and 'integrate incremental learning of skills and knowledge over longer periods of time.' The idea of a self-organizing curriculum is perfectly aligned with the developmental perspective highlighted in the IMOL framework. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address how this approach might connect to developmental psychology or other cross-disciplinary aspects mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation is well-articulated, identifying a specific gap in current approaches to intrinsic motivation. The main idea clearly outlines a framework where goal generation and intrinsic motivation co-evolve, with a feedback loop between them. The mechanism for how goals leading to sustained learning progress would be reinforced is explained concisely. The concept of a 'dynamic, self-organizing curriculum' effectively communicates the intended outcome. However, some technical details remain somewhat abstract - for instance, the specific implementation of the generative model for goals, the exact metrics for measuring learning progress, and the mathematical formulation of how the goal generator parameters would be updated could be further elaborated to achieve perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in proposing the co-evolution of intrinsic motivation and goal generation. While intrinsic motivation systems and goal-based learning are established concepts in the field, their tight integration in a feedback loop where one shapes the other represents a fresh perspective. The concept of having the intrinsic motivation system not only drive exploration but also shape the goal generation process itself is particularly innovative. The self-organizing curriculum aspect builds upon existing work in curriculum learning but extends it in a more autonomous, agent-driven direction. The idea isn't entirely without precedent - some work exists on adaptive goal generation and curriculum learning - but the specific framing of co-evolution between these systems and the emphasis on long-term skill acquisition represents a novel contribution to the IMOL field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core components - generative models for goals, intrinsic motivation based on learning progress, and policy learning - all have established implementations in the literature. However, integrating these components into a cohesive system where they effectively co-evolve presents non-trivial challenges. Designing a goal generator that can be meaningfully parameterized and updated based on learning progress feedback requires careful engineering. Ensuring that the system doesn't get stuck in local optima or degenerate into generating only simple goals would be another challenge. The computational resources required for training both the policy and the goal generator simultaneously might be substantial. Despite these challenges, the idea builds on existing techniques and doesn't require fundamentally new algorithms, making it implementable with current technology and knowledge."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence: how to create truly autonomous agents that can structure their own learning over extended periods. If successful, this approach could significantly advance the field of open-ended learning by enabling agents to develop increasingly complex skills without human intervention or task-specific reward functions. The self-organizing curriculum aspect is particularly significant as it addresses the critical issue of how agents can build upon previously acquired knowledge in a principled way - a key component of human-like learning that current AI systems struggle with. The approach could have broad implications across reinforcement learning, developmental robotics, and artificial general intelligence research. It directly tackles the core objectives outlined in the IMOL framework and could lead to agents with substantially more autonomous and flexible learning capabilities."
