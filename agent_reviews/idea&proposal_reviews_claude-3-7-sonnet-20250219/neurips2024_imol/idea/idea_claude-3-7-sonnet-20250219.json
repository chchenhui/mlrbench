    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description on intrinsically-motivated and open-ended learning. The proposal directly addresses the core challenge identified in the task: developing autonomous agents capable of flexible, open-ended learning without predefined learning signals. The idea of agents that generate and evolve their own goal spaces is perfectly aligned with the task's emphasis on agents that can 'adaptively create goals and switch between them.' The proposal's focus on meta-learning for goal generation directly supports the 'incremental learning of skills and knowledge over longer periods of time' mentioned in the task. The only minor limitation is that while the task mentions drawing inspiration from developmental psychology and other fields, the proposal doesn't explicitly reference these cross-disciplinary connections, though its approach is compatible with them."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-structured framework with three specific components: a generative goal model, an adaptive selection mechanism, and a goal space evolution module. The motivation and problem statement are clearly defined, and the proposed solution logically follows from the identified gap. The multi-criteria assessment approach (learning progress, novelty, achievability, future utility) is well-specified. However, some technical details remain somewhat abstract - for instance, the exact mechanisms for goal space restructuring (merging, splitting, abstracting) could benefit from more concrete examples or specifications. Additionally, while the overall architecture is clear, the specific algorithms or mathematical formulations that would implement these components are not provided, which is understandable given the space constraints but does leave some implementation questions unanswered."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates exceptional novelty in the field of intrinsically motivated learning. While intrinsic motivation and curiosity-driven learning have been explored extensively (as referenced in the task description), the specific innovation of having agents generate and evolve their own goal spaces represents a significant advancement. Most existing approaches use fixed, pre-engineered goal spaces or reward functions, whereas this proposal makes the goal space itself emergent and adaptive. The meta-learning approach to goal generation is particularly innovative, as is the concept of goal space evolution through operations like merging and splitting goals based on discovered relationships. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional approaches where the structure of goals is predetermined, to one where the very nature of what constitutes a meaningful goal is learned and refined through experience."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of the proposed research presents moderate challenges. While the conceptual framework is sound, implementing a system where agents truly generate and evolve meaningful goal spaces involves significant technical hurdles. The generative goal model would require sophisticated mechanisms to create useful goals rather than arbitrary ones. The multi-criteria assessment system would need careful balancing to avoid pathological behaviors (like focusing only on easily achievable goals). The goal space evolution module presents perhaps the greatest challenge, as automatically discovering meaningful relationships between goals to inform restructuring is a complex problem. Additionally, the computational resources required for meta-learning at this level could be substantial. These challenges don't make the research impossible, but they do suggest it would require significant algorithmic innovation and computational resources to implement effectively. The proposal would benefit from more specific technical approaches to address these implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is exceptionally high. If successful, it would address one of the fundamental limitations in current AI systems: their reliance on predefined objectives and inability to autonomously adapt their learning goals in open-ended environments. This directly addresses what the task description identifies as a key concern for deploying AI 'in the real world without human intervention.' The ability for agents to generate and evolve their own goal spaces would represent a major step toward truly autonomous lifelong learning systems. This could have profound implications across robotics, reinforcement learning, and artificial general intelligence. The approach could potentially bridge the gap between narrow AI systems that excel at specific tasks and more general systems capable of open-ended development. The research also has significant theoretical value in understanding how autonomous goal-setting might emerge in learning systems, which could inform our understanding of developmental processes in humans and other animals."
