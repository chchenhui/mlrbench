        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description of Intrinsically-Motivated and Open-Ended Learning. The proposed dynamic skill tree construction directly addresses the core challenges mentioned in the task: autonomous exploration, intrinsic motivation, and open-ended learning without predefined learning signals. The idea incorporates key concepts from the task description including curiosity-driven learning (via the learning-progress signal), autonomous goal creation (through clustering of experienced end-states), and incremental skill acquisition (via the hierarchical tree structure). The proposal specifically targets the development of 'broad and flexible repertoires of knowledge and skills' as highlighted in the task's opening question."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (autonomous curriculum construction), the proposed solution (dynamic skill tree), and the key components of the approach (embedding end-states, clustering into sub-goals, learning-progress signals, meta-controller for selection). The methodology is well-structured with a logical flow from data collection to goal selection to policy learning. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how exactly the clustering algorithm works, how the learning-progress signal is calculated, and the specific mechanism for pruning stagnated nodes. These details would need further elaboration in a full proposal, but the core idea is articulated concisely and comprehensibly."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. The dynamic construction of a skill tree based on experienced states is innovative, particularly the integration of embedding end-states, clustering them into candidate sub-goals, and using learning progress as an edge weight for exploration. While individual components like goal-conditioned RL, hindsight experience replay, and intrinsic motivation based on learning progress have been explored before, their integration into a self-organizing hierarchical structure that evolves over time represents a novel approach. The idea doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithmic components, but rather presents a creative synthesis of existing techniques to address the open-ended learning challenge in a new way."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. All the core components (variational autoencoders for embedding, clustering algorithms, goal-conditioned RL, hindsight experience replay) are well-established techniques with available implementations. The integration of these components presents moderate challenges, particularly in designing an effective learning progress signal and ensuring the tree structure remains manageable as it grows. Computational resources could become a constraint as the skill tree expands, and there may be challenges in ensuring stable learning across different levels of the hierarchy. However, these challenges appear surmountable with careful engineering and experimentation. The proposal could be implemented incrementally, starting with simpler environments before scaling to more complex domains."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence: enabling agents to autonomously structure their own learning curriculum in open-ended environments. If successful, it could significantly advance the field of intrinsically motivated learning by reducing the need for hand-crafted goal spaces and enabling more human-like skill acquisition. The potential impact extends to multiple domains including robotics, reinforcement learning, and developmental AI. The approach could lead to more adaptable agents capable of lifelong learning in complex, changing environments - a key objective highlighted in the task description. The significance is particularly high given the growing interest in autonomous agents that can learn without extensive human supervision or engineering."
