    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description on Intrinsically-Motivated and Open-Ended Learning. It directly addresses the core challenges mentioned in the task: autonomous lifelong learning, adaptive goal creation and switching, and incremental skill development. The proposed hierarchical framework with contextual goal generation specifically targets the limitations identified in the task description regarding agents' ability to 'generalize to domains different from the ones encountered at design time' and 'adaptively create goals and switch between them.' The idea incorporates curiosity-driven learning mechanisms and intrinsic motivation principles that are central to the IMOL framework described in the task. The only minor limitation is that while the idea mentions skill reusability, it could more explicitly address how it connects to some specific recent advances mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, providing a well-structured explanation of both the motivation and the proposed approach. The hierarchical framework is clearly described with distinct lower-level skill-specific policies and a meta-level goal-generation module. The mechanism for contextual goal selection based on environmental statistics is well articulated, and concrete examples (e.g., prioritizing exploration in food-scarce environments) help illustrate the concept. The validation approach and success metrics are also clearly specified. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific implementation of the attention mechanism, how the skill library is structured, and the exact mechanisms for few-shot transfer. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to intrinsically motivated learning. While intrinsic motivation and hierarchical reinforcement learning are established concepts, the integration of contextual goal generation through meta-reinforcement learning represents an innovative direction. The dynamic alignment of intrinsic goals with evolving environmental properties is particularly novel, as most existing approaches use static intrinsic reward mechanisms. The attention mechanism for analyzing environmental statistics to guide goal selection is a fresh approach to the problem of balancing exploration and exploitation. The skill library with few-shot transfer for novel contexts also adds originality. However, it builds upon existing concepts in meta-RL and intrinsic motivation rather than introducing entirely new paradigms, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The hierarchical architecture with lower-level policies and a meta-level goal generator is implementable using existing reinforcement learning techniques. The proposed validation in procedurally generated tasks is practical and aligns with current research practices. However, several aspects increase implementation complexity: (1) designing an effective attention mechanism that can analyze diverse environmental statistics may require significant engineering; (2) creating a skill library with effective composition mechanisms for few-shot transfer is challenging; (3) balancing the meta-learning process to avoid instability between levels of the hierarchy will require careful tuning; and (4) the computational resources needed for training such a system across diverse environments may be substantial. These challenges are surmountable but will require considerable effort and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence: creating agents capable of autonomous, lifelong learning across dynamic environments. If successful, it would represent a significant advancement in intrinsically motivated learning by enabling agents to adaptively generate contextual goalsâ€”a capability crucial for real-world deployment. The potential impact extends to multiple domains including robotics, reinforcement learning, and developmental AI. By bridging the gap between curiosity-driven exploration and practical skill development, it directly tackles a key limitation of current approaches identified in the task description. The focus on skill reusability and adaptation to novel contexts also addresses the critical need for generalization in AI systems. The significance is particularly high given the growing interest in developing autonomous agents that can learn without human supervision in open-ended environments."
