    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OTML workshop's focus on 'Unbalanced formulation (OT between measures of different mass)' and 'OT to define data transformations (domain adaptation)'. The proposal fully develops the initial idea of Adaptive Unbalanced Optimal Transport (A-UOT) for domain adaptation under label shift, providing a comprehensive methodology that builds upon the literature review's identified challenges. It specifically addresses the challenge of parameter selection in UOT by learning marginal relaxation parameters, tackles label shift handling through adaptive mechanisms, and incorporates computational enhancements to address scalability issues. The proposal also references and extends the work mentioned in the literature review, particularly building on Fatras et al.'s unbalanced minibatch OT and addressing the limitations identified in prior work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the mathematical formulation is precise with well-defined notation. The algorithmic steps are presented in a sequential manner that is easy to follow. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear descriptions of datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) The relationship between the adaptive parameters α and β and the neural networks ψ and φ is presented in two different ways (as functions and as linear models with softplus activation), which creates some ambiguity; (2) The exact mechanism for integrating pseudo-label statistics into the parameter learning could be more explicitly detailed; (3) Some technical terms (e.g., 'H-divergence') are used without definition, which might be unclear to readers unfamiliar with the domain adaptation literature."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to domain adaptation by introducing adaptive parameter learning in unbalanced optimal transport. The key innovation—learning the marginal relaxation parameters α and β as functions of pseudo-label statistics—represents a significant advancement over fixed UOT methods that require manual tuning. This addresses a critical gap identified in the literature review. The integration of UOT with dynamic class proportion estimation also represents a novel combination of techniques. However, the proposal builds heavily on existing methods (UOT, pseudo-labeling, entropy regularization) rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The adaptive parameter learning mechanism, while innovative, is an extension of existing UOT frameworks rather than a completely new paradigm. The proposal acknowledges its foundations in prior work and clearly positions its contributions as advancements rather than revolutionary changes."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of A-UOT is well-defined and builds appropriately on established OT theory. The problem formulation clearly states the assumptions (label shift with class-conditional feature alignment), which are consistent with the domain adaptation literature. The algorithmic steps are logically sequenced and technically sound. The proposal also addresses computational challenges through minibatch UOT and Sinkhorn acceleration, showing awareness of practical implementation issues. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that will allow for meaningful comparison. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) The theoretical guarantees for the adaptive parameter learning approach are not explicitly provided; (2) The convergence properties of the joint optimization of transport plans and relaxation parameters could be more thoroughly analyzed; (3) The proposal could more explicitly connect the adaptive parameter learning to formal label shift estimation theory."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation requirements. The methodology builds on established OT algorithms and deep learning frameworks, making it technically implementable. The computational enhancements (minibatch UOT, Sinkhorn acceleration) address potential scalability issues. The selected datasets (MNIST-USPS, PACS, Camelyon17) are publicly available and commonly used in domain adaptation research. The baseline methods are well-defined and comparable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The joint optimization of feature extractor, classifier, transport plans, and adaptive parameters may be challenging and potentially unstable; (2) The proposal does not discuss the computational resources required for the experiments, particularly for the larger Camelyon17 dataset; (3) The timeline for implementation and experimentation is not specified; (4) The proposal mentions 'shallow neural networks' for parameter learning but doesn't specify their architecture or training procedure in detail. Despite these concerns, the overall approach appears implementable with current technology and methods, though it may require careful optimization and parameter tuning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant challenge in domain adaptation—handling label shifts without manual parameter tuning—that has practical implications across multiple application domains. The potential impact is substantial in areas such as autonomous systems, healthcare, and NLP, where label distributions often vary between training and deployment environments. The expected outcomes include both theoretical advancements (adaptive parameter learning, robustness guarantees) and practical improvements (>10% performance gains on benchmarks with extreme label shifts). The proposal directly addresses five key challenges identified in the literature review, potentially advancing the state-of-the-art in OT-based domain adaptation. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's focus on real-world applications where label shifts are common and problematic. However, the impact may be somewhat limited to specific domain adaptation scenarios rather than broadly transforming the field of optimal transport or machine learning as a whole."
