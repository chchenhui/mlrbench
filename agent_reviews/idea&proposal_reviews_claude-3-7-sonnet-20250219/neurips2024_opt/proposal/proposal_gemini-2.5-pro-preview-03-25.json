        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 focus on 'Scaling up optimization' by investigating how optimization hyperparameters scale with model size. The proposal incorporates the core concept from the research idea of developing optimization-aware scaling laws for efficient hyperparameter transfer. It thoroughly references and builds upon the literature review, citing key papers like Li et al. (2025), Xie et al. (2024), and Fetterman et al. (2023), and addresses the identified challenges such as hyperparameter sensitivity, computational cost, and transferability issues. The methodology is comprehensive and includes systematic experiments across model sizes and optimizers, exactly as outlined in the idea. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions LLM-based HPO approaches, the proposal doesn't fully incorporate this as a potential baseline or complementary method."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research questions and objectives are precisely defined, and the methodology provides detailed explanations of the experimental design, data collection, and evaluation metrics. The mathematical formulations of the proposed scaling laws are presented clearly with appropriate notation. The algorithmic steps for deriving and validating the OASLs are logically sequenced and easy to follow. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the proposal could more explicitly define the exact model architectures to be used in experiments, (2) some technical details about the implementation of the validation framework could be elaborated further, and (3) the relationship between different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate and batch size) could be more thoroughly addressed in the scaling law formulations rather than treating each hyperparameter independently."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by integrating optimization dynamics into scaling laws, an area that has been identified as a gap in current research. While individual papers like Li et al. (2025) and Xie et al. (2024) have explored aspects of hyperparameter scaling, this proposal uniquely combines multiple dimensions: (1) considering various optimizers beyond just learning rate and batch size, (2) developing a comprehensive framework that formalizes the relationships into mathematical scaling laws, and (3) creating a practical tool for hyperparameter prediction. The approach of systematically studying how different optimizers' hyperparameters scale differently is particularly novel. However, the core methodological approach of deriving power-law relationships from empirical data follows established patterns in scaling law research, and some of the individual components (like hyperparameter transfer) have been explored in prior work. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly articulating how its unified framework advances beyond the sum of existing approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The research design is well-grounded in established scaling law literature and optimization theory. The mathematical formulations for the hypothesized scaling laws are appropriate, and the log-linear regression approach for fitting power laws is standard practice. The experimental methodology includes important controls such as multiple runs with different random seeds, clear definitions of 'optimal' hyperparameters, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. The validation approach comparing against multiple baselines is thorough and well-designed. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and explores alternative functional forms beyond simple power laws. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical justification for why different optimizers might exhibit different scaling behaviors could be more developed, (2) the proposal could better address potential confounding factors in the experiments, such as the impact of different initialization schemes or architectural variations, and (3) more discussion of statistical significance testing for the derived scaling laws would enhance rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a somewhat feasible research plan but faces significant implementation challenges. The core methodology of training models at various scales to derive scaling laws is conceptually straightforward but computationally intensive. Training multiple model sizes with different optimizers and hyperparameter sweeps will require substantial computational resources, especially for the larger models (up to 10B parameters mentioned). The validation phase with even larger models (potentially 7B-13B) adds further computational demands. While the approach is technically implementable with current technology, the resource requirements may be prohibitive for many research groups without industry-scale compute access. The proposal acknowledges compute constraints but doesn't fully address how to manage them. Additionally, the timeline for completing such extensive experiments is not specified, and the number of hyperparameter combinations to be tested could grow exponentially. The proposal could be more feasible by starting with a more limited scope (fewer optimizers or hyperparameters) or by leveraging existing pre-trained checkpoints to reduce computational needs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in large-scale model training with potentially substantial impact. If successful, the Optimization-Aware Scaling Laws would significantly reduce the computational resources, time, and energy required for hyperparameter tuning of large models - a major bottleneck in current AI development. This aligns perfectly with the OPT 2024 focus on scaling optimization efficiently. The practical significance is clear: enabling researchers with limited resources to train large models more effectively, accelerating research cycles, and reducing the environmental footprint of AI development. The scientific significance lies in advancing our fundamental understanding of how optimization dynamics interact with model scaling, potentially inspiring new optimizer designs. The proposal could have transformative impact on how large models are trained, making AI development more accessible and sustainable. However, the significance depends on how well the derived laws generalize across different model architectures, tasks, and training regimes beyond those tested in the experiments, which remains an open question."
