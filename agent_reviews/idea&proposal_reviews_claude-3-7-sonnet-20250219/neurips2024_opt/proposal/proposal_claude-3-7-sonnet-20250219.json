    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the focus on 'Scaling up optimization' mentioned in the task description, particularly the questions about model size-dependent learning rates and hyperparameter selection. The proposal follows the research idea closely, developing optimization-aware scaling laws that model interactions between optimizer hyperparameters, model size, and optimizer choice. The literature review is well-integrated, with the proposal building upon recent work like 'Optimization Hyper-parameter Laws for Large Language Models' and 'Predictable Scale'. The methodology addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as hyperparameter sensitivity, computational cost, and transferability issues."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research question is precisely defined: 'How do optimal hyperparameters scale with model dimensions and optimizer properties, and can we derive predictive laws to guide hyperparameter selection for large-scale models?' The methodology is logically organized into four phases with detailed explanations of each step. The mathematical formulations for the proposed scaling laws are presented with clear notation and explanations. The implementation details and experimental protocol are thoroughly described. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as more specific details on how the optimizer-specific scaling functions (f_o(o), g_o(o), h_o(o)) will be formulated and a more detailed explanation of the uncertainty quantification approach in the recommendation framework."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach by explicitly incorporating optimization dynamics into scaling laws, which addresses a significant gap in current research. While scaling laws for model performance exist (as noted in the literature review), the integration of optimizer hyperparameters into these laws is innovative. The proposed mathematical framework for relating hyperparameters to model dimensions and optimizer properties is original, particularly the formulation of power-law relationships with optimizer-specific scaling functions. The hyperparameter recommendation framework that leverages these scaling laws for efficient transfer from smaller to larger models represents a fresh perspective on the problem. The proposal builds upon existing work but extends it in meaningful ways, offering a comprehensive approach that combines empirical experimentation, theoretical modeling, and practical application."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-founded and rigorous in its approach. The methodology is based on established experimental practices in deep learning research, with appropriate controls and metrics. The mathematical formulations for the scaling laws follow reasonable assumptions based on observed patterns in optimization dynamics. The experimental design includes systematic variation of model architectures, optimization algorithms, and hyperparameters, which should provide robust data for deriving the scaling laws. However, there are some potential weaknesses in the theoretical foundations. The power-law assumption for scaling relationships, while plausible, could benefit from stronger theoretical justification. Additionally, while the proposal mentions developing 'theoretical justifications for the observed scaling behaviors,' it doesn't provide specific approaches for this theoretical analysis. The validation methodology is comprehensive, but the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential confounding factors and how they will be controlled."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but with significant challenges. The systematic experimentation across model scales from 10M to 10B parameters is ambitious and will require substantial computational resources. The proposal acknowledges this challenge and suggests a multi-fidelity approach to manage costs, which is practical. The implementation using established frameworks (PyTorch, JAX, DeepSpeed) is realistic. However, the comprehensive grid searches for optimal hyperparameters across multiple model architectures and optimization algorithms will be computationally intensive, even with the proposed efficiency measures. The derivation of mathematical relationships from the experimental data is feasible, but the complexity of the interactions between hyperparameters, model dimensions, and optimizer properties may make it difficult to identify clean scaling laws. The validation on large language model training and fine-tuning tasks is particularly resource-intensive and may need to be scaled back or conducted with industry partnerships to be fully realized."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in modern machine learning: the inefficient use of computational resources for hyperparameter tuning in large models. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions. From a practical perspective, the expected 30-50% reduction in computational costs for hyperparameter tuning would translate to significant financial savings and reduced environmental impact for large-scale AI training. The democratization aspect is particularly important, as it could enable smaller research groups with limited resources to participate more effectively in large model research. From a scientific perspective, the work would advance our theoretical understanding of optimization dynamics in deep learning and potentially lead to new optimization algorithms. The proposal directly addresses the compute-optimal scaling challenge highlighted in the task description and could influence how the field approaches large model training. The alignment with current concerns about AI's environmental impact further enhances its significance."
