    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 focus on 'scaling up optimization' by investigating how optimal hyperparameters scale with model size. The proposal incorporates key elements from the literature review, including extending Opt-Laws (Xie et al., 2024) and integrating with CARBS (Fetterman et al., 2023). It maintains consistency with the original research idea of developing optimization-aware scaling laws for efficient hyperparameter transfer. The methodology clearly outlines approaches to derive mathematical relationships between hyperparameters and model size, which is central to the task's focus on scaling laws and optimization. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions LLM-based hyperparameter optimization, this approach isn't incorporated into the proposal's methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed algorithmic approach with specific mathematical formulations for the proposed scaling laws. The experimental validation plan is well-defined with appropriate baselines and metrics. The expected outcomes are concrete and quantifiable. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact procedure for integrating the derived scaling laws with CARBS could be more detailed, (2) The proposal mentions 'gradient noise theory' without prior explanation, and (3) Some technical details about the implementation of the hyperparameter recommender framework could be more specific. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and follows a logical structure."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by explicitly focusing on the integration of optimization dynamics into scaling laws, which addresses a gap in current research. While scaling laws for model and data size exist (Kaplan et al., 2023), and some work on hyperparameter optimization for large models has been done (Fetterman et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024), this proposal uniquely combines these areas to create optimization-aware scaling laws. The approach of systematically quantifying relationships between optimal hyperparameters and model size across different optimizers is innovative. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing work (particularly Opt-Laws and CARBS) rather than introducing entirely new concepts. The mathematical formulations for power-law modeling and SDE extensions represent incremental innovations rather than groundbreaking methodological advances. The novelty lies more in the integration and application of existing approaches to a specific problem rather than in developing fundamentally new techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established optimization theory and scaling law research. The mathematical formulations for power-law modeling and stochastic differential equations are technically sound and appropriate for the research objectives. The experimental design includes proper controls, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The proposal correctly identifies the need for both empirical validation and theoretical modeling, showing a balanced approach. The connection to existing work (Opt-Laws, CARBS) is well-justified and technically appropriate. The only minor weaknesses in soundness are: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential limitations of power-law modeling for certain hyperparameters that might not follow such relationships, and (2) There's limited discussion of how architecture-specific factors might influence the generalizability of the derived scaling laws. Overall, the technical approach is rigorous and well-founded in optimization theory."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. The empirical hyperparameter sweeps across multiple model sizes and optimizers are resource-intensive but achievable with proper computational infrastructure. The methodology leverages existing frameworks (CARBS, Opt-Laws) which increases feasibility. The experimental validation plan is realistic and well-defined. However, several challenges affect feasibility: (1) Conducting comprehensive hyperparameter sweeps for models up to 1B parameters requires significant computational resources, (2) The proposal aims to generalize across diverse architectures, which may be difficult given architecture-specific optimization dynamics, (3) The timeline for developing both theoretical models and a practical framework is ambitious. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of computational requirements and potential resource constraints. Despite these challenges, the core research objectives are achievable, especially if the scope is adjusted based on initial findings."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in modern machine learning: the computational and environmental costs of hyperparameter tuning for large models. The potential impact is substantial and well-articulated. By enabling efficient hyperparameter transfer across model sizes, the research could significantly reduce the computational resources required for training large models, directly addressing the environmental impact of AI research. The proposal quantifies this impact (e.g., saving ~1.2 GWh/year per major AI lab, reducing hyperparameter search costs by 50-70%). The work bridges theoretical optimization research with practical large-scale ML challenges, aligning perfectly with the OPT 2024 focus. The democratization aspect—making large model training more accessible to resource-constrained researchers—adds social significance. While the proposal may not revolutionize the fundamental approach to ML training, it addresses a critical efficiency bottleneck in current practices with potentially far-reaching practical implications."
