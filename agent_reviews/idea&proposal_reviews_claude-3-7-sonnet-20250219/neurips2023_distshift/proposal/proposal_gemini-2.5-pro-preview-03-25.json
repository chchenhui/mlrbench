    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on distribution shifts in foundation models, particularly the challenge of preserving robustness during adaptation. The RobustKD-FM framework implements the core idea of using knowledge distillation to preserve robustness during fine-tuning, with the original foundation model serving as a 'robustness teacher.' The proposal incorporates relevant literature, citing works on knowledge distillation for robustness (Zhou et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023), the problem of robustness degradation during fine-tuning (Kumar et al., 2022), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (Hu et al., 2021). The methodology comprehensively addresses all aspects mentioned in the research idea, including the hybrid loss function, out-of-distribution sample generation, and activation pattern preservation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The problem statement, proposed solution, and research objectives are explicitly defined. The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations for each component of the loss function, making the approach technically precise and reproducible. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear descriptions of datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The only minor areas that could benefit from further clarification are: (1) more specific details on how the diverse inputs for activation pattern preservation (x_div) will be selected, and (2) more explicit discussion of how the hyperparameters 位_KD and 位_act will be balanced across different types of distribution shifts. Overall, the proposal is highly understandable with a logical flow that guides the reader through the research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a new way to address an important problem. The core innovation lies in using the original foundation model as a 'robustness teacher' specifically for preserving out-of-distribution performance during fine-tuning. While knowledge distillation itself is not new, the application to robustness preservation during foundation model adaptation, combined with the activation pattern preservation regularization, represents a novel approach. The proposal builds upon existing work like WiSE-FT (Wortsman et al., 2021) and distillation methods (Zhou et al., 2023), but extends them with the activation preservation component and integration with PEFT techniques. The approach is not entirely groundbreaking, as it leverages established techniques like KD and regularization, but it applies them in a new context with a specific focus on robustness preservation that hasn't been fully explored in prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness. The mathematical formulations of the loss functions are well-defined and theoretically justified. The approach builds on established principles in knowledge distillation and regularization, with clear connections to the literature. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics that align with standard practices in distribution shift research. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, showing awareness of technical hurdles. The integration with PEFT methods is technically sound and addresses scalability concerns. The only minor limitation is that the theoretical analysis of why activation pattern preservation should help maintain robustness could be more developed, though the intuition behind it is reasonable."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation requirements. The integration with PEFT methods like LoRA addresses scalability concerns for large foundation models. The datasets and evaluation benchmarks (WILDS, ImageNet-C, DomainBed) are publicly available and commonly used. The computational requirements, while substantial, are within the range of typical research in this area, especially with the PEFT optimization. However, there are some feasibility challenges: (1) generating effective OOD samples might be computationally intensive or domain-specific, (2) the hyperparameter tuning across multiple dimensions (位_KD, 位_act, temperature, layer selection) could be extensive, and (3) for very large models, even with PEFT, the teacher forward passes required for distillation might introduce significant computational overhead. These challenges are acknowledged in the proposal but might still impact the scope or timeline of the research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the deployment of foundation models: the loss of robustness during fine-tuning. This issue has significant implications for high-stakes applications in healthcare, autonomous driving, and other domains where distribution shifts are common and consequential. If successful, RobustKD-FM could provide a practical method for preserving the inherent robustness of foundation models while adapting them to specialized tasks. The integration with PEFT techniques enhances the practical impact by making the approach accessible even with limited computational resources. The research directly contributes to the workshop's focus on adaptation strategies under distribution shifts and could influence best practices for deploying foundation models in real-world scenarios. While not completely transformative of the field, the work addresses an important gap in current methods and could significantly improve the reliability of fine-tuned foundation models in distribution shift scenarios."
