    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on distribution shifts in foundation models, particularly the question of how to adapt models without sacrificing robustness. The proposed constrained knowledge distillation framework aligns perfectly with the initial idea of using a 'robustness teacher' mechanism. The methodology incorporates key elements from the literature review, including knowledge distillation techniques (similar to DAD from Zhou et al.), parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA (Hu et al.), and addressing the robustness degradation problem identified by Kumar et al. The proposal also acknowledges WiSE-FT as a baseline, showing awareness of existing approaches. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions self-distillation (SDFT), the proposal doesn't explicitly incorporate this technique, though it's not a significant omission given the comprehensive approach taken."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed algorithmic framework with well-defined components: data collection and augmentation, hybrid loss function (with mathematical formulations), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The experimental design outlines specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes are quantified with concrete performance targets. The only areas that could benefit from slight refinement are: (1) more specific details on how the OOD examples will be generated for different domains, and (2) clearer explanation of how the hyperparameters α, β, and γ in the loss function will be determined. Despite these minor points, the proposal remains highly comprehensible and well-articulated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing techniques in a novel way to address the specific problem of robustness degradation during fine-tuning. The integration of knowledge distillation with activation pattern regularization and parameter-efficient fine-tuning creates a unique framework. While individual components like knowledge distillation (Zhou et al.), LoRA (Hu et al.), and activation-based regularization exist in the literature, their combination and specific application to preserving OOD robustness during fine-tuning represents a fresh approach. The proposal's novelty lies in its comprehensive framework rather than introducing entirely new algorithms. The hybrid loss function that balances task performance, distillation, and activation regularization is a notable contribution, though it builds upon established techniques. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more fundamentally new techniques rather than novel combinations of existing methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical foundations. The methodology builds on proven techniques like knowledge distillation, adversarial training, and low-rank adaptation, all of which have strong theoretical backing. The mathematical formulations for the loss functions are correctly presented and appropriate for the task. The experimental design includes proper baselines (standard fine-tuning, WiSE-FT, LoRA-only, DAD) and evaluation metrics that directly measure the phenomena of interest (ID/OOD accuracy, robustness gap, activation similarity). The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. The proposal demonstrates awareness of potential challenges and limitations. The only minor weakness is that the proposal could have provided more detailed justification for why the specific combination of techniques would address the robustness degradation problem better than existing approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and resources. The use of LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning reduces computational requirements, making the approach accessible to researchers with limited resources. The datasets mentioned (WILDS benchmarks, MIMIC-CXR) are publicly available, and the baseline methods are well-documented in the literature. The experimental design is realistic and achievable. The proposal acknowledges computational efficiency as a consideration, with LoRA integration expected to reduce trainable parameters by >90%. The only potential challenges that might affect feasibility are: (1) the computational cost of generating synthetic OOD examples, especially for large-scale datasets, and (2) the potential difficulty in tuning the hyperparameters of the hybrid loss function to balance task performance and robustness. Overall, the approach is practical and implementable with reasonable resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the deployment of foundation models: the degradation of robustness during fine-tuning for specialized tasks. This issue has substantial implications for high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal NLP, and conservation, where distribution shifts are inevitable and errors can have serious consequences. The expected outcomes—reducing the robustness gap while maintaining task performance—would represent a significant advancement in making foundation models more reliable in real-world applications. The proposal's impact extends beyond specific applications to theoretical understanding of robustness in foundation models. The commitment to release code, benchmarks, and a toolkit further enhances the potential impact by enabling broad adoption. The significance is well-aligned with the workshop's focus on distribution shifts in foundation models and addresses a fundamental challenge in the field. The proposal clearly articulates how success would contribute to trustworthy AI systems capable of reliable operation in dynamic environments."
