        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenges of deploying generative AI in healthcare, focusing on safety and interpretability as highlighted in the task description. The SAFEGEN framework precisely implements the core idea of providing interpretable safety checks for generative medical imaging by combining anomaly detection with explainable AI techniques. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like diffusion models for anomaly detection (Bercea et al., 2023, 2024; Fontanella et al., 2023), interpretability approaches (Wang & Cao, 2024), and generative frameworks (Pinaya et al., 2023). The methodology section clearly builds upon these works while addressing the identified challenges in the literature review, such as interpretability of anomaly detection and preservation of healthy tissue."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The introduction effectively establishes the context and motivation for the research. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the framework components, including mathematical formulations for the diffusion model approach and clear descriptions of the experimental design. The flow diagram helps visualize the framework architecture. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of how the interpretability module will be adapted for diffusion models could be more specific, (2) the threshold selection process for anomaly detection could be elaborated, and (3) some technical details about the integration between the ADM and IM modules could be further explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by combining anomaly detection with explainable AI specifically for safety validation of generative medical imaging. While both anomaly detection in medical imaging and explainable AI are established research areas, their integration for safety assessment of synthetic medical images represents a fresh approach. The proposal innovates by adapting explainability techniques to work with diffusion-based anomaly detection, which is not trivial given the complexity of diffusion models. The focus on fine-grained, localized feedback rather than global quality metrics is also novel. However, the core technical components (diffusion models, gradient-based explanations) build upon existing methods rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms. The novelty lies more in the application context and integration of these techniques rather than in developing entirely new methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks, particularly for diffusion models and anomaly detection. The mathematical formulations for the diffusion model approach are correctly presented, and the proposed anomaly scoring mechanisms are valid. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate metrics (AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, IoU) for quantitative evaluation and a well-designed human study for qualitative assessment. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and offers alternative approaches (e.g., GAN/AE-based methods as alternatives to diffusion models). The validation strategy involving both synthetic artifacts and real radiologist assessment is particularly robust. The only minor limitations are: (1) some assumptions about the adaptability of XAI techniques to diffusion models that might require further theoretical justification, and (2) potential computational challenges in implementing gradient-based explanations across the multi-step diffusion process that aren't fully addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The use of publicly available medical imaging datasets (BraTS, ADNI, LIDC-IDRI) and established generative modeling techniques makes data collection and model training practical. The methodology builds on existing techniques that have been demonstrated to work in related contexts. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect the feasibility score: (1) Adapting explainability techniques to diffusion models is non-trivial and may require significant algorithmic innovation; (2) The computational resources required for training diffusion models on high-resolution medical images could be substantial; (3) Recruiting radiologists for the human evaluation component may be challenging and time-consuming; (4) The proposal aims to eventually extend to multiple imaging modalities, which might be ambitious given the complexity of each modality. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do increase its complexity and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in deploying generative AI for medical imaging with high potential impact. Safety validation of synthetic medical images is essential before their use in clinical settings or for training diagnostic AI systems, making this research directly relevant to real-world healthcare applications. The interpretability component adds significant value by enabling both developers and clinicians to understand and trust the safety assessment process. The expected outcomes would contribute to: (1) safer deployment of generative models in healthcare, potentially preventing diagnostic errors; (2) improved development of medical generative models through better understanding of failure modes; (3) enhanced trust in synthetic medical data; and (4) potential regulatory pathways for AI systems using synthetic data. The research aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on deployment-critical features like safety and interpretability in high-stakes domains. The potential to establish standards for safety validation of synthetic medical images further enhances its significance."
