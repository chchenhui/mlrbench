    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modeling interactions between humans, algorithmic decision-making, and society, with particular emphasis on feedback loops and long-term impacts. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including dynamic causal modeling, structural causal models for algorithm-human interactions, reinforcement learning integration, and intervention modules for equity. The literature review is thoroughly integrated throughout the proposal, with appropriate citations to all ten papers and explicit connections to their contributions (e.g., Clark & Lewis's intervention modules, Walker & Hall's auditing toolkit, Scott & Adams's benchmarks). The proposal also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly around modeling dynamic interactions, ensuring long-term fairness, and balancing utility with equity."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the dynamic causal framework, including formal mathematical notation for structural equations that helps clarify the proposed approach. The integration of RL and equilibrium analysis is well-articulated, and the intervention module design is described with sufficient detail. The experimental design outlines specific scenarios that will be tested. However, there are some areas where additional clarity would be beneficial, particularly in explaining how the proposed causal regularization would be implemented in practice and how the counterfactual exploration strategies would work. Some technical concepts (e.g., mean-field game theory) are mentioned without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these areas. Overall, though, the proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to modeling algorithm-human feedback loops. While individual components (causal modeling, RL, equilibrium analysis) have been explored separately in the literature, the integration of these methods into a unified dynamic framework represents a novel contribution. The proposal's emphasis on time-evolving Structural Causal Models to capture the recursive nature of algorithm-human interactions is particularly innovative. The development of intervention modules based on causal principles for promoting long-term equity also represents a fresh approach. The proposal builds upon existing work (e.g., Davis & Brown's structural causal models, Johnson & Lee's RL with fairness considerations) but extends these ideas in new directions. The combination of causal regularization, counterfactual exploration, and dynamic re-weighting strategies for intervention is innovative. While not entirely groundbreaking, the proposal offers a substantial advancement over current approaches by providing a more comprehensive framework for understanding and mitigating harmful feedback loops."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations, drawing appropriately from causal inference, reinforcement learning, and game theory. The formalization of the dynamic causal framework using time-evolving SCMs is technically rigorous, with well-defined variables and structural equations. The integration of RL for modeling algorithm adaptation is conceptually sound. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened. The proposal acknowledges the challenges in collecting real-world data but could provide more detail on how the semi-synthetic data approach will address potential biases. The equilibrium analysis section mentions techniques from mean-field game theory but doesn't fully elaborate on how these will be applied. The proposal also doesn't thoroughly address potential limitations of the causal framework, such as the challenge of correctly specifying the structural equations or handling unobserved confounders in real-world settings. While the overall approach is methodologically sound, these gaps in technical detail and consideration of limitations slightly reduce its rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan but faces several implementation challenges. The simulation-based approach is practical and allows for controlled experimentation. The use of synthetic and semi-synthetic data is a reasonable workaround for the difficulty in obtaining comprehensive real-world data (addressing Key Challenge 5). However, the scope of the project is ambitious, potentially requiring significant computational resources for simulating complex algorithm-human interactions over long time horizons. The development of realistic human behavior models that accurately capture preference shifts and strategic adaptation is particularly challenging and may require simplifications that limit the real-world applicability of the findings. The proposal acknowledges these challenges but could provide more detail on how they will be addressed. The timeline for completing all aspects of the research (framework development, simulation implementation, intervention design, validation, and toolkit creation) is not specified, raising questions about practicality. While the core components are implementable with current technology and methods, the comprehensive integration of all elements represents a substantial undertaking that may require considerable refinement and iteration."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in algorithmic decision-making with far-reaching implications for society. Understanding and mitigating harmful feedback loops between algorithms and human behavior is essential for ensuring that AI systems promote rather than undermine equity and social welfare. The expected outcomes—particularly the dynamic causal framework, intervention modules, and auditing toolkit—have the potential to significantly impact both research and practice in responsible AI. The proposal's emphasis on long-term equity rather than just short-term fairness metrics represents an important advancement in algorithmic fairness research. The interdisciplinary nature of the work, bridging machine learning, causal inference, game theory, and social sciences, aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of bringing together diverse communities. The policy relevance of the research is substantial, potentially informing evidence-based regulation of AI systems in sensitive domains. The proposal directly addresses pressing societal concerns such as polarization, discrimination, and inequality exacerbated by algorithmic systems. Overall, the potential impact of this research on theory, practice, and policy is exceptional."
