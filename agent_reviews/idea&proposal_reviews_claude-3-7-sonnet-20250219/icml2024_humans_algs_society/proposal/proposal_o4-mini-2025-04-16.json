    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on modeling interactions between humans, algorithmic decision-making, and society, with particular emphasis on feedback loops and their long-term impacts. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including dynamic causal modeling, structural causal models, reinforcement learning, and intervention modules. It also builds upon the literature review, specifically citing and extending work on dynamic fairness (arXiv:2306.67890) and causal inference in algorithmic decision-making (arXiv:2301.12345). The methodology section thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as modeling dynamic interactions, ensuring long-term fairness, and balancing utility with equity."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and significance. The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations of the structural causal model, reinforcement learning approach, and intervention modules. The experimental protocol and evaluation metrics are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the relationship between the latent 'preference-state' vector and observable behaviors could be more explicitly defined, (2) the exact implementation details of the causal debiaser module could be more thoroughly explained, and (3) some of the mathematical notation, while precise, might be challenging for interdisciplinary audiences to follow without additional explanation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers significant novelty in its approach to integrating multiple methodological frameworks (structural causal models, reinforcement learning, and equilibrium analysis) to address algorithm-human feedback loops. The three intervention modules (Causal Debiaser, Utility Regularizer, and Equilibrium Stabilizer) represent an innovative approach to maintaining fairness dynamically. The formulation of the problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process with fairness constraints is particularly novel. While individual components build upon existing work in causal inference and reinforcement learning for fairness, the unified framework and the specific focus on recursive interactions over time represent a fresh perspective. The proposal acknowledges its foundations in prior work while clearly articulating its novel contributions, particularly in bridging theoretical causal modeling with practical system design for long-term equity."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations in causal inference, reinforcement learning, and fairness. The mathematical formulations are generally correct and well-presented. The structural causal model appropriately captures the recursive nature of algorithm-human interactions, and the constrained MDP formulation provides a principled approach to balancing utility and fairness. The primal-dual optimization approach is a standard method for handling constrained optimization problems. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the assumption that group membership is binary (g_i ∈ {0,1}) may oversimplify real-world scenarios with intersectional identities, (2) the proposal could more thoroughly address potential issues with the identifiability of causal effects in the SCM, and (3) the convergence properties of the primal-dual algorithm in this specific context could be more thoroughly analyzed. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable scope. The use of both synthetic environments and real-world case studies provides a practical path to validation. The experimental protocol is well-designed with appropriate baselines and metrics. The computational requirements, while substantial, appear manageable with modern computing resources. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) accurately modeling human behavior and preferences in the SCM may be challenging and require significant domain expertise, (2) the availability and quality of real-world data that captures dynamic interactions over time may be limited, and (3) the complexity of implementing and tuning all three intervention modules simultaneously could present practical challenges. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges implicitly but could benefit from a more explicit discussion of potential implementation difficulties and mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in algorithmic decision-making with far-reaching societal implications. By focusing on the dynamic, recursive nature of algorithm-human interactions, it tackles a fundamental limitation in current approaches to algorithmic fairness. The potential impact is substantial across multiple domains (recommendation systems, credit scoring, hiring) where algorithmic decisions significantly affect individual welfare and societal outcomes. The deliverables—including a theoretical framework, open-source toolkit, benchmarks, and policy guidelines—have both academic and practical significance. The work bridges multiple disciplines (machine learning, economics, network science, public policy) and could influence how algorithmic systems are designed, deployed, and regulated. The focus on long-term equity rather than just short-term fairness metrics represents an important shift in perspective that could lead to more sustainable and just algorithmic systems."
