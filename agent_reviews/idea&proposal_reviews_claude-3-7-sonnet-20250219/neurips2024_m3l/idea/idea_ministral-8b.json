        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Continuous approximations of training trajectories' topic mentioned in the workshop. The proposal directly tackles the question posed in the task: 'Can we obtain insights into the discrete-time gradient dynamics by approximating them with a continuous counterpart, e.g., gradient flow or SDE? When is such an approximation valid?' The idea also connects to other workshop topics like convergence analysis and the Edge of Stability phenomenon. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address how this work might connect to the broader themes of the workshop beyond optimization, such as generalization or foundation models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity. It clearly articulates the motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The three-step methodology (discretization analysis, validation of approximations, and theoretical framework development) provides a well-structured approach. The connections to practical outcomes like enhanced convergence analysis and algorithm design are well-explained. However, some technical details could be more specific - for instance, what specific mathematical tools will be used for the continuous approximations, or what precise conditions will be investigated for validity of these approximations. The idea would benefit from more concrete examples of how the continuous approximations would be formulated and analyzed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows good novelty in its approach to bridging theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning optimization. While continuous approximations of discrete optimization processes have been studied before (e.g., in SDE formulations of SGD), this proposal aims to develop a more comprehensive framework specifically for understanding modern deep learning phenomena like the Edge of Stability. The focus on using these approximations to design practical algorithms with theoretical guarantees is a valuable direction. However, the core concept of using continuous approximations for discrete optimization is not entirely new in the field, and the proposal could more clearly articulate what specific novel insights or techniques it will introduce beyond existing work in this area."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears feasible with current mathematical tools and computational resources. The continuous approximation of gradient dynamics has established precedents in optimization theory, and extending this to deep learning is a natural progression. The three-step methodology provides a reasonable roadmap for implementation. However, there are challenges: validating the approximations for complex deep learning landscapes may be difficult, and establishing theoretical guarantees that hold in practice for large-scale models is notoriously challenging. The proposal acknowledges the gap between theory and practice but doesn't fully address how it will overcome the known difficulties in analyzing non-convex optimization landscapes of deep networks. Some preliminary results or pilot studies would strengthen the feasibility assessment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research has high potential significance for the field of deep learning optimization. If successful, it could provide much-needed theoretical guidance for practitioners, potentially reducing computational costs for training large models - a critical concern in the current AI landscape. The work directly addresses a fundamental gap between optimization theory and deep learning practice, which is increasingly important as models scale. The potential to develop more efficient training algorithms based on sound theoretical principles could have broad impact across deep learning applications. The significance is particularly high given the computational and environmental costs associated with training large models, where even modest improvements in efficiency could have substantial practical benefits."
