    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's question about synthetic data solving data access problems by proposing a targeted approach (Active Synthesis) that leverages model uncertainty to guide synthetic data generation. The methodology incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the active learning-inspired framework, uncertainty estimation techniques, and conditional generative models. The proposal also addresses most topics of interest mentioned in the task description, such as new algorithms for synthetic data generation, applications across domains (healthcare, vision, NLP), mixing synthetic and natural data, and evaluation of synthetic data quality. The literature review's themes of uncertainty-driven data generation, active learning with generative models, and model calibration are thoroughly integrated throughout the proposal. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions privacy preservation, it could have more explicitly addressed some of the ethical concerns raised in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations. The Active Synthesis loop is clearly explained in a step-by-step manner, making the iterative process easy to understand. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is comprehensively outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) some mathematical notations (e.g., π_syn and π_real) are introduced without full explanation, (2) the relationship between uncertainty thresholds τ and generation parameters could be more explicitly defined, and (3) the exact implementation details of how uncertainty metrics will condition the generative models could be further elaborated. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing the Active Synthesis framework, which integrates model uncertainty estimation with targeted synthetic data generation in a closed-loop system. While individual components (uncertainty estimation, generative models, active learning) exist in prior work as shown in the literature review, the proposal offers a fresh perspective by systematically combining these elements into a unified framework applicable across multiple data modalities (vision, text, tabular). The approach of using uncertainty as a dynamic driver for synthetic data generation represents an innovative extension beyond existing methods. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that similar concepts have been explored in the literature (as evidenced by references 6 and 10 in particular, which mention 'active synthesis' and combining active learning with generative models). The proposal extends rather than fundamentally transforms existing approaches, though it does so in a comprehensive and well-integrated manner."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-established theoretical foundations. The uncertainty estimation techniques (Monte Carlo Dropout and ensemble methods) are based on solid Bayesian principles and are appropriately formulated. The mathematical expressions for uncertainty quantification, conditional generation, and model training are technically correct and well-presented. The experimental design is rigorous, with appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics that cover performance, generalization, synthetic quality, and efficiency. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges (overfitting, quality assessment) and offers mitigation strategies. The integration of differential privacy for ethical safeguards shows technical awareness of privacy concerns. The only minor weaknesses are: (1) the proposal could provide more details on how the conditional generative models will be trained to respond to uncertainty signals, and (2) some theoretical guarantees or convergence properties of the Active Synthesis loop could be more thoroughly analyzed. Overall, the technical approach is well-founded and demonstrates a high level of rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components and implementation details. The data sources (CIFAR-10, CelebA, IMDB, etc.) are standard and accessible. The computational requirements are explicitly stated (32 A100 GPU hours for SD LoRA, 16 H100 for LLaMA fine-tuning), indicating practical awareness of resource needs. The methodology leverages existing models (Stable Diffusion, LLaMA-3) with adaptations rather than building entirely new architectures from scratch. The experimental design includes concrete hyperparameters and implementation details that suggest implementability. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) fine-tuning large models like LLaMA-3 8B to condition on uncertainty metrics may require significant expertise and resources, (2) the iterative nature of the Active Synthesis loop could lead to extended training times, especially for large datasets, (3) the proposal mentions human validation for realism assessment, which may introduce scalability challenges. While these challenges don't render the proposal impractical, they do represent non-trivial implementation hurdles that would require careful management of resources and potential simplifications of certain components."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in machine learning: how to efficiently leverage synthetic data to improve model performance while reducing reliance on large quantities of real data. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on whether synthetic data can solve data access problems. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) Efficiency - the targeted approach could reduce the amount of data needed for effective training, (2) Robustness - addressing model weaknesses directly could improve generalization to edge cases, (3) Privacy - reducing reliance on real data has important privacy implications, (4) Democratization - making high-performance ML more accessible in resource-constrained scenarios. The expected outcomes include concrete performance improvements (5-10% on benchmark tasks with 50% less real data), which would represent meaningful advances. The cross-domain applicability (vision, NLP, tabular) enhances the significance further. The proposal also contributes theoretically by formalizing uncertainty as a dual signal for both augmentation and evaluation. While the impact could be transformative in specific domains like healthcare diagnostics, the broader impact on the field might be evolutionary rather than revolutionary, as it builds upon and extends existing paradigms rather than introducing entirely new ones."
