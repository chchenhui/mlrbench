        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the SoLaR workshop's focus on transparency, equity, and accountability in language models, with specific attention to low-resource languages as mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including adapting explanation techniques like SHAP and LIME for low-resource languages, co-designing interfaces with native speakers, and establishing evaluation metrics for both technical robustness and user trust. The literature review is thoroughly integrated throughout the proposal, with appropriate citations to works on low-resource language models (e.g., InkubaLM [1], Glot500 [2]), interpretability challenges (references [8], [9]), and community-centered approaches (reference [6]). The methodology directly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as morphological complexity, code-switching, and community engagement."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and directly connected to the problem statement. The methodology section is particularly strong, with a detailed four-phase approach that clearly outlines data collection, adaptation of interpretability techniques, community-driven interface co-design, and evaluation. The technical aspects are explained with appropriate formalism (e.g., the SHAP equation for morpheme-level explanations) without becoming overly complex. The proposal could benefit from slightly more concrete examples of how the adapted interpretability methods would work in practice for specific low-resource languages, and some technical details in the evaluation section could be more precisely defined. However, these are minor issues in an otherwise very clear proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. First, it addresses a clear gap in the literature by focusing on interpretability specifically for low-resource language models, an area that has received limited attention despite its importance. Second, the adaptation of existing interpretability methods (LIME, SHAP) to handle unique linguistic features like complex morphology and code-switching represents a novel technical contribution. Third, the community-centered co-design approach for explanation interfaces is innovative, moving beyond the typical technical-only focus of interpretability research. The proposal builds upon existing work in interpretable AI and low-resource NLP but combines these elements in new ways. While individual components (like LIME/SHAP or participatory design) are established, their application to this specific context and their integration into a comprehensive framework for low-resource language interpretability is novel."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a methodology that builds on established techniques in interpretable AI and participatory design. The technical adaptations for morphology and code-switching are conceptually well-justified, with appropriate mathematical formulations for the SHAP approach. The evaluation framework is comprehensive, addressing both technical and user-centric aspects. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened. For instance, the proposal acknowledges the need for approximations in implementing morpheme-level SHAP but doesn't fully detail how these approximations would work. Similarly, while the proposal mentions language identification for code-switching, it doesn't fully address the challenges of accurate language identification in extremely low-resource contexts. The user-centric evaluation metrics are well-described but could benefit from more specific validation approaches. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and builds appropriately on prior work."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan but faces several implementation challenges. The four-phase methodology is logical and well-structured, with reasonable steps for data collection, method adaptation, interface co-design, and evaluation. The use of existing resources like InkubaLM and Glot500 is practical. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Recruiting sufficient native speakers for multiple low-resource languages could be challenging, especially for diverse representation; (2) Developing morphological analyzers for languages that may lack such resources is non-trivial; (3) The co-design process requires significant time and resources to be done properly; (4) The technical adaptations of LIME/SHAP for morphology and code-switching are complex and may encounter unexpected challenges. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could benefit from more contingency planning. The timeline is not explicitly discussed, which makes it difficult to assess whether all phases could be completed within a reasonable research period. Overall, while ambitious, the research is implementable with appropriate resources and time."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in language model research with substantial potential impact. By focusing on interpretability for low-resource languages, it directly tackles issues of equity, transparency, and accountability highlighted in the SoLaR workshop description. The significance is multi-faceted: (1) It addresses the digital divide by making advanced NLP technologies more accessible and trustworthy for marginalized linguistic communities; (2) It provides concrete tools and methods for researchers and developers working with low-resource languages; (3) It establishes a framework for community involvement in AI development that could serve as a model for other contexts; (4) It contributes to the broader field of responsible AI by demonstrating how technical solutions can be combined with participatory approaches to address social concerns. The expected outcomes, including open-source tools and best-practice guidelines, have clear practical value beyond academic contributions. The proposal convincingly articulates how this work advances multiple goals of socially responsible language modeling research."
