        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the SoLaR workshop's focus on transparency, explainability, and applications for low-resource languages. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the development of an interpretability framework, extension of local explanation techniques (SHAP, LIME), collaboration with native speakers, and establishment of evaluation metrics. It also effectively integrates insights from the literature review, referencing relevant works like InkubaLM, Glot500, and GlotLID. The methodology section clearly outlines how these elements will be implemented, with specific steps for data collection, algorithmic development, and evaluation that align with both the task requirements and cited literature."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research goals are explicitly stated in the introduction, and the methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of data collection, algorithmic steps, experimental design, and evaluation metrics. The proposal effectively communicates the technical approaches (adapting SHAP and LIME) while also explaining the community collaboration aspects. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly delineated. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more specific details on how the perturbed input tests will be designed and implemented, and more concrete examples of how the linguistic features of low-resource languages will be accommodated in the explanation techniques."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to combining technical interpretability methods with community-driven validation specifically for low-resource languages. The adaptation of existing explanation techniques (SHAP, LIME) to accommodate unique linguistic features of low-resource languages represents a fresh perspective. The emphasis on co-designing explanation interfaces with native speakers to align with cultural communication norms is particularly innovative. However, while the proposal builds upon existing explanation techniques rather than introducing entirely new methods, the application context and combined approach offer sufficient novelty. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more groundbreaking technical innovations in the interpretability methods themselves, rather than primarily adapting existing techniques."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. It builds upon established explanation techniques (SHAP, LIME) with well-justified adaptations for low-resource languages. The experimental design includes appropriate data collection strategies, clear algorithmic steps, and comprehensive evaluation metrics covering both technical robustness and user-perceived trust. The proposal effectively incorporates insights from the literature review, referencing relevant works like InkubaLM, Glot500, and GlotLID to support its approach. The dual evaluation strategy (technical metrics and user studies) strengthens the methodological soundness. However, the proposal could benefit from more detailed technical specifications of how exactly SHAP and LIME will be modified to handle morphological complexities and code-switching patterns, including potential mathematical formulations of these adaptations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible research plan with realistic objectives and methodology. It leverages existing resources (Glot500, InkubaLM) and established techniques (SHAP, LIME) as starting points, which increases practicality. The phased approach to development, starting with technical adaptations and then incorporating community feedback, is sensible and manageable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional resources or effort. The community collaboration aspect, while valuable, introduces logistical complexities in recruiting and engaging native speakers from diverse linguistic backgrounds. The proposal acknowledges the need for both technical robustness and user-perceived trust evaluations, which will require significant time and coordination. Additionally, adapting explanation techniques to accommodate the unique features of multiple low-resource languages simultaneously may prove more challenging than anticipated."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in AI research with substantial potential impact. By enhancing transparency and interpretability of language models for low-resource languages, it directly contributes to making AI more inclusive, equitable, and accountable. The significance is multifaceted: it addresses technical challenges in interpretability, promotes linguistic diversity in AI, empowers marginalized communities to participate in AI development and auditing, and establishes frameworks for culturally grounded explainability. The open-source tools and guidelines proposed as outcomes would benefit both the research community and linguistic communities. The work aligns perfectly with the SoLaR workshop's emphasis on fairness, equity, accountability, transparency, and safety in language modeling research. The potential to reduce bias risks and foster equitable adoption of language technologies in underrepresented communities represents a meaningful contribution to socially responsible AI."
