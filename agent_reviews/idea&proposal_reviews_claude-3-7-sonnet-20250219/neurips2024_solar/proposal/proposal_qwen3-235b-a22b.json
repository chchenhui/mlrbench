    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the SoLaR workshop's focus on transparency, explainability, and applications for low-resource languages. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including adapting explanation techniques for low-resource languages, community-driven interface design, and evaluation metrics for both technical robustness and user trust. The literature review is thoroughly integrated, with specific references to works like InkubaLM [1], Glot500 [2], and various papers on explainability and low-resource languages. The proposal's three-phase methodology comprehensively addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as limited training data, linguistic diversity, and code-switching."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the three-phase methodology is well-defined with specific technical strategies, data collection methods, and evaluation metrics. The mathematical formulations for morpheme-aware SHAP, code-switching detection, and evaluation metrics are precisely presented. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact selection criteria for the 5-10 focus languages, (2) more details on how the community co-creation workshops will be structured and facilitated, and (3) clearer connections between the technical metrics and user-perceived trust metrics. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality in several aspects. The adaptation of explainability techniques (SHAP, LIME) specifically for morphological features and code-switching in low-resource languages represents a novel technical contribution. The morpheme-aware SHAP approach and code-switching attention mechanism are innovative extensions of existing methods. The community-driven interface design process is particularly original, as it integrates technical explainability with cultural communication norms—a combination rarely explored in current literature. The proposal also introduces new evaluation metrics that bridge technical robustness and user-perceived trust. While it builds upon existing work in explainable AI and low-resource language models (as cited in the literature review), the integration of these approaches with community participation and cultural considerations creates a fresh and innovative framework that distinguishes itself from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a strong theoretical basis in both explainable AI and low-resource language processing. The technical formulations for morpheme-aware SHAP and code-switching detection are mathematically coherent and build upon established methods. The three-phase methodology is logically structured and addresses the key challenges identified in the literature. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the perturbation stability metric could benefit from more justification of the chosen noise distribution, (2) the fidelity score assumes ground truth labels for explanations, but it's unclear how these would be obtained for low-resource languages, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly address potential conflicts between technical optimization and community preferences. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, it leverages existing resources like Glot500 and InkubaLM, and the technical adaptations of SHAP and LIME are implementable with current methods. The phased approach allows for incremental progress. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) coordinating with 3-5 native speaker communities for co-creation workshops requires significant logistical effort and cultural navigation, (2) developing morpheme analyzers for multiple low-resource languages is resource-intensive, especially given the linguistic diversity, (3) the timeline for completing all three phases is not specified but likely requires substantial time, and (4) the evaluation process involving both technical metrics and user studies across multiple languages adds complexity. While the core technical work is achievable, the full scope of community engagement and comprehensive evaluation across multiple languages may require considerable resources and time management."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in language model research with potentially high impact. By focusing on interpretability for low-resource languages, it directly contributes to equity and inclusion in AI—a pressing concern as language technologies become increasingly embedded in global society. The significance is multifaceted: (1) technical contributions to explainable AI for morphologically complex languages, (2) methodological advances in community-driven NLP development, (3) practical tools that empower marginalized linguistic communities to audit and refine models, and (4) ethical frameworks for responsible AI deployment in diverse contexts. The work aligns perfectly with SoLaR's emphasis on socially responsible language modeling and could influence both technical research directions and deployment practices. The potential applications in education, healthcare, and language preservation further enhance its significance. By bridging technical innovation with social responsibility, the proposal addresses fundamental challenges in making AI benefits more equitably distributed across linguistic communities."
