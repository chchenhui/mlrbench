        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Transparency, explainability, interpretability of LMs' topic explicitly mentioned in the SoLaR workshop call. The proposal directly tackles the black-box nature of LLMs and aims to provide causal explanations for their outputs, which is central to the workshop's focus on responsible and ethical research in language modeling. The idea also touches on auditing and evaluation aspects, as well as potential bias identification, which are other key topics in the workshop description. The only minor reason it's not a perfect 10 is that it could more explicitly connect to some of the societal impact considerations mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a clear methodology that combines causal mediation analysis with counterfactual input perturbations. The proposal articulates a specific process: identifying influential tokens and representations, generating counterfactual edits, computing causal effect scores, and delivering explanations as ranked 'what-if' statements. The evaluation plan is also well-defined, covering faithfulness, user trust, and robustness. However, some technical details about how exactly the causal effect scores will be computed across different layers and how the information bottleneck probes work could benefit from further elaboration, preventing a perfect score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing techniques (gradient-based saliency, information bottleneck probes, counterfactual edits) in a novel framework specifically for LLM explanation. The causal framing of explanations and the focus on minimal counterfactual edits that correlate with intermediate activations represents an innovative approach to LLM interpretability. However, many of the individual components (saliency methods, counterfactual explanations) have been explored in prior work on model interpretability, albeit perhaps not in this specific combination for LLMs. The approach builds upon existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques, which is why it scores a 7 rather than higher."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears quite feasible with current technology and methods. The gradient-based saliency methods and counterfactual generation techniques mentioned are established approaches in the field. However, there are some implementation challenges that prevent a higher score: (1) generating meaningful counterfactual edits that actually flip model outputs can be difficult and computationally expensive for large models; (2) accessing and analyzing intermediate activations in very large LLMs may be challenging due to computational constraints; (3) establishing true causal relationships in complex neural networks remains an open research problem; and (4) evaluating explanation faithfulness is notoriously difficult. These challenges are significant but likely surmountable with sufficient resources and careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI: the lack of transparency in LLMs. As these models become increasingly integrated into society, understanding why they produce specific outputs is essential for trust, accountability, and safety. The proposed causal explanations could significantly advance our ability to audit models, identify biases, and improve model design. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in regulatory compliance, responsible AI deployment, and user trust. The approach could lead to actionable insights that help prevent harmful outputs. The significance is particularly high given the growing societal concerns about LLM transparency and the explicit focus of the SoLaR workshop on addressing these issues."
