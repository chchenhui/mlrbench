    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses one of the core topics mentioned in the workshop call: addressing model uncertainty in learning-based solutions for inverse problems where only partial information about the system model is available. The proposal also specifically focuses on diffusion models as priors for solving inverse problems, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The idea addresses real-world applications like MRI reconstruction, which matches the workshop's emphasis on practical impact in domains like medical tomography. The only minor reason it's not a perfect 10 is that it could have more explicitly discussed the 'trustworthiness' aspect mentioned in the workshop overview."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (partial knowledge of forward operators), the proposed solution (uncertainty-aware diffusion models), and the technical approach (hierarchical variational inference framework). The motivation is well-explained, and specific applications are identified. However, there are some technical details that could benefit from further elaboration, such as the exact mechanism for representing the forward operator as a parameterized probability distribution and how the joint sampling process would work in practice. The hierarchical variational inference framework is mentioned but not fully explained, which leaves some ambiguity about the implementation details."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by addressing a critical gap in current approaches. While diffusion models for inverse problems exist, explicitly incorporating uncertainty in the forward operator and jointly sampling from both the solution space and operator distribution represents a novel direction. The hierarchical approach to simultaneously refine estimates of both the inverse solution and forward model parameters appears to be an innovative contribution. The score is not higher because there has been some prior work on uncertainty quantification in inverse problems and on learning forward models, though perhaps not in the specific context of diffusion models with partial operators as proposed here."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Diffusion models are well-established, and variational inference frameworks have been applied to inverse problems before. However, jointly sampling from solution and operator spaces while maintaining computational efficiency could be challenging. The hierarchical approach might face convergence issues or require significant computational resources. The proposal mentions specific applications (under-calibrated MRI and seismic imaging), suggesting the authors have considered practical implementation contexts, which strengthens feasibility. The score reflects that while the approach is implementable with current technology, it will likely require substantial algorithmic development and optimization to work effectively."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental limitation in current deep learning approaches to inverse problems. The inability to handle partial information about forward operators severely restricts the application of powerful methods like diffusion models in real-world scenarios. By bridging this gap, the proposed approach could significantly expand the applicability of deep learning to critical domains like medical imaging and remote sensing where model uncertainty is unavoidable. The potential impact is substantial, as it could enable more reliable reconstructions in scenarios where current methods fail. The practical applications mentioned (MRI reconstruction and seismic imaging) are fields where improvements could have direct societal benefits in healthcare and geological exploration."
