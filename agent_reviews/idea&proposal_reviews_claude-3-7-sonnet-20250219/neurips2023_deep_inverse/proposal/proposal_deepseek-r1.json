    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on model uncertainty in learning-based solutions for inverse problems. The methodology incorporates meta-learning to handle forward model uncertainty, which was the core concept in the research idea. The proposal cites and builds upon the literature review papers, including Guan et al. (2024) for untrained forward model residual blocks and Khorashadizadeh et al. (2022) for uncertainty quantification using normalizing flows. The proposal also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as model mismatch, uncertainty quantification, and generalization across models. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal doesn't extensively discuss diffusion models, which was mentioned as a topic of interest in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the algorithmic framework is presented with mathematical precision, including formulas for the meta-learning approach. The network architecture and experimental design are well-defined with specific baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact parameterization of the forward model uncertainty distribution P(A) could be more precisely defined, (2) the integration of the normalizing flow with the meta-learning framework could be explained in more detail, and (3) there's a small notation error in the task sampling section where a closing bracket is misplaced in '{\\mathcal{T}_i}_{i=1}^N}'."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining meta-learning with physics-informed neural networks specifically for handling forward model uncertainty in inverse problems. The integration of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) with uncertainty quantification via normalizing flows represents a novel approach not fully explored in the literature. The hybrid physics-DL design that incorporates untrained forward model residual blocks is also innovative. However, the core components (meta-learning, physics-informed neural networks, uncertainty quantification) are established techniques being applied to a new problem rather than fundamentally new methodological innovations. The proposal extends existing work rather than introducing entirely groundbreaking concepts, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound with a well-justified methodology. The meta-learning framework is mathematically formulated with clear inner-loop adaptation and meta-optimization steps. The integration of physics-based regularizers in the loss function is theoretically well-motivated. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that directly measure the claimed benefits (robustness, uncertainty calibration, adaptation speed). The proposal builds on established techniques from the literature, including MAML and normalizing flows. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from more rigorous justification: (1) the theoretical convergence properties of the meta-learning approach under non-convex settings with perturbed operators are acknowledged as a limitation but not addressed, (2) the choice of specific hyperparameters (like α and β in the meta-learning algorithm) is not discussed, and (3) the proposal could provide more detailed analysis of how the approach handles different types of forward model uncertainties."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The meta-learning framework using MAML is well-established and implementable. The datasets mentioned (FastMRI, OpenFWI) are publicly available, and the simulation of forward model perturbations is practical. The evaluation metrics are standard and measurable. However, there are feasibility concerns: (1) the computational cost of meta-training with task-specific simulations is acknowledged as a limitation and could be substantial, (2) implementing conditional normalizing flows for high-dimensional inverse problems may require significant computational resources, (3) the proposal aims to handle a wide range of inverse problems (MRI, seismic tomography, scattering-based reconstruction) which may require domain-specific adaptations, and (4) the expected 3 dB improvement under 20-30% perturbations is ambitious and may be challenging to achieve consistently across all application domains."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in applying deep learning to inverse problems: the performance degradation due to forward model uncertainty. This is a significant limitation in real-world applications like medical imaging and geophysical exploration. The potential impact is substantial as the proposed framework could enable more reliable deployment of DL-based inverse problem solvers in safety-critical domains. The expected outcomes include quantifiable improvements in robustness, uncertainty quantification, and adaptation speed. The proposal clearly articulates applications in medical imaging, geophysical exploration, and industrial sensing, all of which have practical importance. While the work could lead to meaningful contributions to the field, it may not be transformative in the sense of creating an entirely new paradigm, but rather represents an important advancement within the existing learning-based inverse problems framework."
