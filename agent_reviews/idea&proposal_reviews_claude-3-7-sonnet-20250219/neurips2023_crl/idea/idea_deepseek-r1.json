        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on causal representation learning. It directly addresses multi-environment causal representation learning, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal aims to disentangle causal factors across modalities to improve robustness under distribution shifts, which matches the workshop's goal of developing representations that support causal reasoning and are more robust. The idea also touches on applications in healthcare, which is listed as a relevant application domain. The cross-modal aspect adds a valuable dimension that fits within the multi-modal CRL topic mentioned in the workshop description."

        "justification": "The research idea is presented clearly with a well-defined problem (spurious correlations in multi-modal data), a proposed solution (inferring shared latent causal variables across modalities), and expected outcomes. The methodology is outlined with sufficient detail - using contrastive learning with modality-specific encoders and differentiable causal discovery. The proposal also specifies concrete evaluation benchmarks (medical imaging with paired text and synthetic data). However, some technical details about the differentiable causal discovery approach and how exactly the cross-modal causal dependencies will be modeled could benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel integration of causal discovery with multi-modal representation learning. While both causal representation learning and multi-modal learning exist separately, the specific focus on cross-modal causal dependencies and using multiple environments to identify invariant causal factors across modalities represents a fresh approach. The combination of contrastive learning techniques with differentiable causal discovery for this purpose appears innovative. The emphasis on interpretable cross-modal causal graphs also adds originality. However, it builds upon existing work in both causal discovery and multi-modal learning rather than introducing a completely new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears feasible but with moderate challenges. The core components (contrastive learning, multi-modal encoders, causal discovery) all have established implementations, making the technical foundation solid. The proposal mentions using medical imaging datasets with paired diagnostic text, which are available. However, causal discovery is inherently challenging, especially in high-dimensional spaces, and ensuring identifiability of the causal structure across modalities may prove difficult. The proposal acknowledges this challenge by suggesting sparsity constraints and leveraging interventional data, but the effectiveness of these approaches in complex real-world settings remains uncertain. The computational requirements for joint causal discovery and representation learning might also be substantial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI: the failure of systems under distribution shifts due to spurious correlations. By focusing on learning causal representations that are invariant across environments, the work could significantly advance the field of robust AI. The healthcare application domain mentioned is particularly impactful, as improved robustness across different clinical settings could lead to more reliable AI-assisted diagnosis. The interpretability aspect of generating cross-modal causal graphs also adds significant value, especially in high-stakes domains where understanding model decisions is crucial. If successful, this approach could provide a framework for developing more reliable AI systems in various domains where multiple data modalities are available."
