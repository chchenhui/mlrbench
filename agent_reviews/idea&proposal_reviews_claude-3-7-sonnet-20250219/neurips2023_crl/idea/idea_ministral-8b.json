    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses causal representation learning for domain generalization, which is a core focus of the workshop. The proposal covers learning causal variables from raw data, improving robustness and transferability, and includes applications in healthcare and medical imaging - all explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The idea incorporates both theoretical aspects (identifiability of causal representations) and practical applications, matching the workshop's goal of bridging theory and practice. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some specific subtopics like multi-modal or multi-environment CRL, though the framework could potentially incorporate these approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity and structure. It clearly outlines the motivation, main idea, methodology (with four well-defined steps), expected outcomes, and potential impact. The problem of domain generalization is well-articulated, and the proposed solution using causal representation learning is logically presented. The methodology provides a clear roadmap for implementation. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, which specific causal discovery algorithms might be employed, how the causal relationships will be combined with learned features, and what metrics will be used to evaluate domain generalization performance. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving the highest clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by integrating causal inference with representation learning specifically for domain generalization. While both causal inference and representation learning are established fields, their combination for robust domain generalization represents a fresh approach. The proposal to learn high-level causal variables directly from raw, unstructured data is innovative. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that causal representation learning itself is an emerging field with existing work, as acknowledged in the workshop description. The methodology follows a relatively standard pipeline (preprocessing, inference, representation learning, evaluation) rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms or frameworks. The idea builds upon existing concepts rather than introducing completely groundbreaking approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces significant challenges. The four-step methodology provides a reasonable implementation path, and the proposal builds on existing techniques in unsupervised learning and causal discovery. However, causal discovery from high-dimensional, unstructured data remains a challenging problem with limited success in real-world applications. Identifying true causal relationships (rather than spurious correlations) from observational data alone is notoriously difficult without interventional data or strong assumptions. The proposal doesn't specify how it will overcome these fundamental challenges in causal inference. Additionally, evaluating causal representations across different domains requires careful experimental design and appropriate datasets, which adds another layer of complexity to the implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant problem in machine learning - the lack of robustness and transferability across domains. If successful, the proposed causal representation learning framework could have substantial impact on improving model performance in unseen domains, which is a critical limitation of current ML systems. The potential applications in healthcare, robotics, and medical imaging highlight practical significance. The focus on interpretability and explainability also aligns with important trends in responsible AI development. The theoretical contributions to identifiability of causal representations would advance the field of causal representation learning. However, given the challenges in implementation, the actual impact might be more incremental than transformative in the short term, which slightly limits the significance score."
