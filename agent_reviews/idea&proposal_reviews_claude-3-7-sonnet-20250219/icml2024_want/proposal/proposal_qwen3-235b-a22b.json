        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the WANT workshop's focus on computational efficiency and resource optimization, specifically targeting activation checkpointing (re-materialization) which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal builds upon the literature review by extending the work of Korthikanti et al. (2022) on selective activation recomputation, addressing the limitations identified in DTR (Kirisame et al., 2020), and connecting to broader trends in resource-efficient training mentioned in the surveys by Han et al. (2024) and Bai et al. (2024). The core idea of gradient-aware checkpointing is faithfully developed from the initial research idea, with comprehensive technical details on implementation and evaluation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for gradient proxy estimation, dynamic thresholding, and layer-specific adaptation. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The only minor issues are: (1) some mathematical notations could benefit from additional explanation (e.g., the relationship between \\\\theta_l^{(t)} and validation loss change \\\\Delta \\\\epsilon), and (2) the figures referenced in the text (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) are not actually included in the proposal, making some visual explanations less clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to activation checkpointing by incorporating gradient magnitude information into the decision process. While activation checkpointing itself is not new, the integration of gradient-aware decisions with dynamic thresholding and layer-specific adaptation represents a meaningful innovation. The approach extends beyond existing methods like DTR and selective recomputation by explicitly tracking gradient importance rather than relying on heuristics tied to layer type or memory pressure. However, the core techniques used (EMA for tracking metrics, gradient norm as a proxy) are relatively standard in the field, and the proposal builds incrementally on existing frameworks rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The gradient proxy estimation and dynamic thresholding mechanisms are well-formulated with clear mathematical expressions. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies and hyperparameter analysis show careful consideration of different design choices. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and edge cases where the method might underperform. The only minor concern is that while the proposal claims significant improvements (e.g., 20-40% reduction in re-computation time), these are presented as expected outcomes rather than demonstrated results, and the theoretical guarantees for convergence could be more rigorously established."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is highly feasible and implementable with current technology and resources. The method builds on existing frameworks like PyTorch's checkpoint module, requiring modifications rather than building entirely new systems. The gradient proxy computation adds minimal overhead (estimated at ~3%), and the implementation details, including pseudocode, are clearly specified. The experimental setup uses standard models (BERT-Large, ResNet-50) and datasets (GLUE, ImageNet) that are widely available. The proposal also considers practical aspects of distributed training integration and provides concrete strategies for implementation. The authors have clearly thought through the technical challenges and provided realistic solutions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in neural network training, particularly for large-scale models where memory constraints are a significant bottleneck. By optimizing the memory-compute trade-off in activation checkpointing, the approach could enable more efficient training of large models, potentially democratizing access for smaller research teams with limited computational resources. The expected outcomes (50-70% memory reduction, 20-40% reduction in re-computation time) would represent meaningful improvements over existing methods. The work also has broader implications for energy-efficient AI and resource-constrained applications in domains like climate forecasting and medical diagnostics. While not revolutionary, these improvements could have substantial practical impact, especially for resource-limited settings."
