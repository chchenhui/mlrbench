        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the challenge of encoding domain knowledge in probabilistic methods for structured data (specifically score-based generative models), which is explicitly mentioned as a focus area in the task description. The proposal targets generating valid structured data (graphs, molecules, trajectories) which are key modalities mentioned in the scope. The idea also has clear applications to scientific discovery, which is listed as a relevant topic in the scope. The only minor reason it's not a perfect 10 is that it doesn't explicitly address some other aspects mentioned in the scope like uncertainty quantification or representation learning, though these could be natural extensions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly identifies the problem (generative models producing syntactically plausible but semantically invalid outputs), proposes a specific solution (modifying reverse diffusion by projecting onto constraint manifolds), and even suggests implementation approaches (gradient projection, constraint-enforcing terms). The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, how exactly the projection would be implemented for different types of constraints, or how the approach would handle potentially conflicting constraints. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows notable originality by combining score-based generative models with explicit domain constraints in a principled way. While both score-based models and constraint satisfaction are established concepts individually, their integration in the proposed manner for structured data generation appears to be a fresh approach. The concept of projecting intermediate states onto constraint manifolds during diffusion is innovative. However, constraint-guided generation has been explored in various forms before (e.g., physics-informed neural networks, constrained VAEs), and the core diffusion model framework remains unchanged. The novelty lies more in the specific application and implementation rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Score-based generative models are well-established, and the mathematical framework for incorporating constraints via projection or additional energy terms is sound. The approach builds on existing techniques rather than requiring entirely new methods. Implementation would require expertise in both diffusion models and the specific domain constraints, but these are reasonable requirements. The main challenges would likely be in efficiently implementing the constraint projections for complex domains and ensuring that the constraints don't overly restrict the generative process. These are manageable challenges rather than fundamental obstacles, making the idea quite feasible overall."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical limitation in current generative models for structured data - their tendency to produce invalid outputs according to domain rules. Solving this problem would significantly enhance the practical utility of these models in scientific and engineering applications, potentially accelerating discovery in fields like drug design, materials science, and physics simulation. The impact could be substantial across multiple domains where valid structure is essential. The approach is also general enough to be applicable to various types of structured data and constraints, further increasing its significance. The ability to generate valid, diverse samples that respect domain knowledge would represent a meaningful advancement in the field of generative modeling."
