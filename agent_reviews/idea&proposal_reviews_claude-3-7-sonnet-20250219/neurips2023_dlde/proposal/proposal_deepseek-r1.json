    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the symbiosis between deep learning and differential equations by proposing DiffPDE, a framework that leverages diffusion models to solve high-dimensional PDEs. The proposal incorporates key elements from the literature review, including latent space compression techniques from references [1] and [3], physics-informed constraints similar to [6], and addresses the challenges of high-dimensional PDEs mentioned in multiple references. The methodology clearly builds upon the existing work while proposing novel extensions, particularly in how the forward diffusion process incorporates PDE operators. The proposal also aligns with the task's focus on neural architectures leveraging classical mathematical models, specifically using stochastic differential equations as the foundation for the diffusion process."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented, with clear explanations of both the forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes. The hybrid loss function is well-defined, showing how score-matching is combined with PDE residual terms. The experimental design section provides specific benchmark PDEs, baselines, and evaluation metrics, giving a concrete plan for validation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact architecture of the score network could be more detailed, particularly regarding the Fourier-based message passing layers; (2) the relationship between the latent space compression and the overall diffusion process could be more explicitly explained; and (3) the curriculum learning approach could be elaborated further to specify how PDE complexity will be increased during training."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The most innovative contribution is the structured diffusion process that explicitly incorporates PDE operators into the forward diffusion SDE, creating a physics-informed noise injection mechanism. This approach differs from existing works in the literature review, which typically apply diffusion models to PDEs without this tight coupling between the stochastic dynamics and the underlying physics. The hybrid loss function that combines score-matching with PDE residuals is also novel, creating a unified training objective that balances generative modeling with physics constraints. While the proposal builds upon existing concepts like latent diffusion models [1, 3] and physics-informed neural networks [6], it integrates these approaches in a novel way and extends them to high-dimensional settings (100+ dimensions). The proposal is not entirely groundbreaking, as it leverages established diffusion model frameworks, but its application to high-dimensional PDEs and the specific modifications to incorporate physics constraints represent meaningful innovation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations, combining principles from diffusion models, stochastic differential equations, and PDE theory. The mathematical formulations for the forward and reverse processes are well-defined and consistent with established diffusion model theory. The hybrid loss function logically combines score-matching with PDE constraints. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the stability of the proposed forward diffusion process with PDE operators is not thoroughly analyzed, particularly for stiff or highly nonlinear PDEs; (2) the convergence properties of the hybrid loss function are not rigorously established; (3) the proposal mentions curriculum learning but doesn't provide theoretical justification for why this would improve training stability for the specific architecture. Additionally, while the experimental design is comprehensive, the proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential failure modes and how they would be addressed. Overall, the approach is theoretically sound but lacks some rigorous analysis that would strengthen its foundations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation paths, but with some notable challenges. On the positive side, the methodology builds on established diffusion model frameworks and neural PDE solvers, which have existing implementations and proven success in related domains. The experimental design is well-thought-out, with specific benchmark PDEs and evaluation metrics. The use of latent space compression to reduce computational costs is a practical approach to handling high-dimensional problems. However, several feasibility concerns exist: (1) training diffusion models for 100+ dimensional PDEs would require substantial computational resources, and the proposal doesn't fully address the scaling challenges; (2) the integration of PDE operators into the diffusion process may introduce numerical stability issues for complex equations; (3) the curriculum learning approach, while promising, may require careful tuning to avoid training failures. The proposal acknowledges some computational challenges by incorporating latent space compression, but doesn't provide detailed estimates of the required computational resources or training times. Overall, the approach is implementable but would require significant expertise and resources to execute successfully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in scientific computing: solving high-dimensional PDEs efficiently and accurately. If successful, this research would have substantial impact across multiple domains. The ability to solve 100+ dimensional PDEs would enable advances in quantum mechanics, climate modeling, financial modeling, and turbulent flow simulation—all fields where high-dimensional equations are common but challenging to solve with traditional methods. The proposal's focus on generalization across parameterized PDEs without retraining is particularly significant for practical applications, potentially enabling real-time simulations for control systems and financial risk assessment. The uncertainty quantification aspect through multiple denoising trajectories adds another layer of value, especially for stochastic PDEs where understanding solution confidence is crucial. The expected performance gains (30% lower L² errors, 50% reduced inference time) would represent meaningful improvements over state-of-the-art methods. By open-sourcing the framework, the research could democratize access to high-dimensional simulation tools, further amplifying its impact. The significance is well-aligned with the workshop's focus on the symbiosis between deep learning and differential equations."
