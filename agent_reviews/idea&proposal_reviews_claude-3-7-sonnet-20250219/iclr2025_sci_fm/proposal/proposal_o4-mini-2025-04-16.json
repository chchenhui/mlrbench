        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The FedDiST-FM proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on open science for foundation models, particularly in the areas of 'Open Training Protocols' and 'Open Compute Efficiency Techniques.' The proposal builds upon the federated distillation concept outlined in the research idea and incorporates insights from the literature review, such as addressing data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and privacy preservation. The methodology section thoroughly explains how knowledge distillation is used to aggregate information from local specialist models without sharing raw data, which is consistent with the papers cited in the literature review. The proposal also addresses the challenge of democratizing FM training by enabling resource-constrained institutions to participate, which aligns with the workshop's goal of advancing accessibility and transparency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and research objectives. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the FedDiST-FM framework, including mathematical formulations for specialist model training, teacher logits generation, aggregation, and student distillation. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, model configurations, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) The relationship between the distillation temperature τ and the overall performance could be elaborated, (2) The process for selecting an appropriate public proxy dataset could be more detailed, and (3) The exact mechanism for handling potential catastrophic forgetting in the student model during sequential distillation rounds could be better explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining federated learning with knowledge distillation specifically for foundation models. While both federated learning and knowledge distillation are established techniques (as evidenced in the literature review), their integration for training foundation models with a focus on communication efficiency and privacy preservation represents a fresh approach. The use of a small public proxy dataset for knowledge transfer is innovative, as is the ability to handle heterogeneous model architectures across clients. However, the core techniques (federated learning, knowledge distillation, differential privacy) are well-established, and similar approaches have been explored in other contexts as mentioned in the literature review (e.g., ProFe, FedFed, HierarchyFL). The proposal extends these ideas to the specific domain of foundation models rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic innovations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for specialist model training, teacher logits generation, aggregation, and student distillation are correctly presented and well-justified. The privacy preservation mechanism using Gaussian noise for differential privacy is theoretically sound. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The communication efficiency analysis provides a clear quantification of the expected benefits. However, there are a few areas that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal could provide more theoretical analysis on the convergence properties of the federated distillation algorithm, (2) The impact of non-IID data distributions on the quality of the distilled model could be more thoroughly analyzed, and (3) The trade-off between privacy (noise addition) and utility could be more rigorously quantified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The implementation plan using PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, and Flower for federated simulation is realistic and appropriate. The hardware requirements, while substantial, are within reach of many research institutions. The experimental design is well-thought-out and achievable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional effort: (1) Coordinating multiple institutions for real-world testing via VPN may face logistical and administrative hurdles, (2) The selection and curation of an appropriate public proxy dataset that covers general language patterns without containing private information could be challenging, (3) Ensuring consistent performance across heterogeneous specialist models with varying architectures may require more sophisticated aggregation techniques than simple averaging, and (4) The computational resources required for training multiple specialist FMs (500M-1B parameters) at different clients are still substantial, which may limit participation from truly resource-constrained institutions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in the field of foundation models: the concentration of FM training capabilities among a few well-resourced institutions. By enabling collaborative training without centralizing data, FedDiST-FM has the potential to democratize access to FM development and promote open science principles. The expected outcomes include significant reductions in communication overhead (≥40%) with minimal performance degradation (≤1%), which would make collaborative FM training more accessible. The privacy preservation aspects are particularly valuable for domains like healthcare and law. The proposal also aligns well with the workshop's goals of fostering transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility in FM research. However, while the impact within the research community could be substantial, the broader societal impact may be limited by the fact that truly large-scale FMs (tens or hundreds of billions of parameters) would still require significant computational resources beyond what this approach might save."
