        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the TiFA program's focus on 'identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking' by developing a cross-modal watermarking framework for MMGMs. The proposal builds upon the literature review's findings on existing watermarking techniques (e.g., InvisMark, GenPTW) while addressing the identified limitations regarding cross-modal consistency and robustness. The research objectives comprehensively tackle the challenges highlighted in both the task description and literature review, particularly the need for reliable content provenance in multi-modal contexts. The methodology incorporates relevant technical approaches from the cited works while extending them to the novel cross-modal latent space embedding concept."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly defined, and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations. The LatentMark framework is explained in detail, including watermark structure, embedding mechanisms, and decoding strategies. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are comprehensively outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for ensuring cross-modal consistency could be more precisely defined with concrete examples, (2) the relationship between the watermarking process and the original MMGM architecture could be more explicitly illustrated, and (3) some technical details about the training process (e.g., specific optimization algorithms, hyperparameter selection) are not fully specified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in its approach to watermarking for multi-modal generative models. The core innovation—embedding watermarks in the shared latent space before modality-specific generation—represents a fresh perspective compared to existing modality-specific watermarking techniques. This approach directly addresses the cross-modal generation challenge that current methods struggle with. The proposal also introduces novel training strategies with composite loss functions specifically designed for cross-modal consistency and robustness. While individual components (like additive watermarking or CNN-based decoders) build upon existing techniques from the literature, their integration into a unified cross-modal framework and the focus on latent space embedding represents a substantial advancement. The proposal acknowledges theoretical limitations from Zhang et al. (2023) but offers a pragmatic approach focused on practical security thresholds, which is a realistic innovation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and technical rigor in most aspects. The watermarking framework is built on established principles from information hiding and deep learning, with clear mathematical formulations for embedding and decoding processes. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, covering imperceptibility, robustness, cross-modal consistency, and security. However, there are some areas where the technical soundness could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical analysis of how the watermark propagates from latent space to different modalities lacks formal guarantees, (2) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the theoretical impossibility results from Zhang et al. (2023), (3) the text watermarking component is acknowledged as challenging but lacks detailed technical solutions, and (4) the security analysis could benefit from more formal definitions of attack models and security guarantees. The training strategy is well-conceived but would benefit from more detailed convergence analysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The use of existing datasets and pre-trained models makes implementation practical. The modular approach to developing embedding and decoding components allows for incremental progress. However, several challenges affect feasibility: (1) accessing and modifying the internal architecture of state-of-the-art MMGMs may be difficult, especially for proprietary models like Sora, (2) the computational resources required for training or fine-tuning large MMGMs with watermarking components could be substantial, (3) achieving robust watermarking across all modalities simultaneously (especially text) presents significant technical hurdles, and (4) the evaluation against adaptive adversarial attacks requires sophisticated attack implementations. The timeline is not explicitly specified, but the scope suggests a multi-year project. Overall, while ambitious, the core components of the proposal are implementable with current technology and methods, though some aspects may need to be scaled back or focused on specific modality combinations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in the era of advanced multi-modal generative AI: establishing reliable content provenance. This work has exceptional significance for several reasons: (1) it directly contributes to combating misinformation and deepfakes by providing a technical means to verify content origins, (2) it supports accountability in AI deployment by linking generated content to specific models or sessions, (3) it offers a technical foundation for emerging regulations requiring disclosure of AI-generated content, (4) it advances the scientific understanding of watermarking in complex multi-modal contexts, and (5) it addresses a specific topic highlighted in the TiFA program (identifiers of AI-generated material). The cross-modal approach is particularly significant as it anticipates the evolution of generative models toward increasingly fluid boundaries between modalities. The potential impact extends beyond academic contributions to practical applications in content verification systems, regulatory compliance tools, and trust-building mechanisms for responsible AI deployment."
