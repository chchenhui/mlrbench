    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the TiFA topic of 'Identifiers of AI-generated material, such as watermarking' and focuses on creating a robust cross-modal watermarking framework for multi-modal generative models. The methodology incorporates insights from the literature review, particularly building upon works like InvisMark, GenPTW, and VLPMarker while addressing the limitations identified in papers by Zhengyuan Jiang et al. and Hanlin Zhang et al. regarding adversarial attacks and watermark robustness. The proposal comprehensively covers the core idea of embedding watermarks in latent space representations to enable tracing across different modalities, which was central to the research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate technical details. The watermark embedding architecture and extraction pipeline are described with mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The experimental validation section outlines specific metrics for evaluation, making the proposal's goals measurable. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for ensuring the watermark propagates through the diffusion process could be more detailed, and (2) the relationship between the watermark binary identifier and the cryptographic provenance information could be more explicitly defined. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a unified approach to watermarking across multiple modalities through latent space manipulation. While individual components draw from existing techniques (like diffusion models and transformer architectures), the integration of these elements into a cross-modal framework represents a fresh perspective. The concept of embedding watermarks at the latent representation level before generation is innovative, especially in ensuring cross-modal traceability. However, the approach shares some similarities with existing methods like VLPMarker (for multi-modal embedding) and GenPTW (for in-generation watermarking). The proposal's novelty lies more in its comprehensive integration and application to the cross-modal challenge rather than introducing fundamentally new watermarking techniques. The adversarial defense component also builds upon established methods rather than proposing entirely new approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The watermarking methodology is built on well-established principles from deep learning, information theory, and cryptography. The mathematical formulations for the latent space encoder, cross-modal fusion network, and robust decoder are technically sound and appropriately specified. The multi-task loss function effectively balances imperceptibility, detection accuracy, and adversarial robustness. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and appropriate for the task. The proposal acknowledges theoretical limitations identified in the literature (e.g., Hanlin Zhang et al.'s work on watermark impossibility) and attempts to address them through a multi-faceted approach. The experimental validation plan is well-designed with appropriate baselines and ablation studies. One minor limitation is that the proposal could more explicitly address how it overcomes the theoretical impossibility results mentioned in the literature review."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The watermarking framework builds on existing technologies and architectures that have been demonstrated in related contexts. The data collection strategy leverages available datasets (LAION-5B, AudioSet) and open-source models (Stable Diffusion 3), making resource acquisition manageable. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and measurable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) ensuring watermark persistence across multiple modalities while maintaining imperceptibility is technically demanding, (2) achieving the targeted >95% bit accuracy under standard post-processing and >80% under adversarial attacks is ambitious given the theoretical limitations noted in the literature, and (3) the computational resources required for training the proposed models across multiple modalities could be substantial. Despite these challenges, the overall approach appears implementable with current technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the era of increasingly powerful multi-modal generative models. The ability to trace AI-generated content across modalities has profound implications for misinformation mitigation, copyright enforcement, and accountability - all explicitly mentioned in the TiFA task description. The framework would provide a technical foundation for regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act) and industry standards for AI content provenance. The expected outcomes align directly with societal needs for trustworthy AI systems. The proposal's focus on both technical robustness and practical applications (open-source tools, benchmarks) enhances its potential impact. The work could significantly advance the field of AI content attribution and verification, addressing a gap that current single-modality watermarking techniques cannot fill. The broader impact section convincingly articulates how this research contributes to addressing pressing challenges in AI governance and trustworthiness."
