        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for trustworthy multi-modal foundation models by focusing on watermarking for AI-generated content provenance, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic in the task description. The proposal comprehensively covers the core concept from the research idea of embedding watermarks in the latent space before content generation across different modalities. It also builds upon the literature review by acknowledging existing challenges in cross-modal watermarking and robustness against manipulations, while proposing solutions that address gaps identified in current research. The mathematical formulation for watermark embedding and the detailed methodology demonstrate a thorough understanding of the context and prior work."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is detailed with specific steps and mathematical formulations. The watermarking framework design is well-explained, including the embedding process, cross-modal implementation, and extraction mechanisms. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the specific details of how the watermark would manifest differently across various modalities could be more explicitly described, (2) the exact nature of the 'unique identifier' could be more precisely defined, and (3) the relationship between the watermark and the model version/session context mentioned in the idea could be more thoroughly elaborated in the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by focusing on cross-modal watermarking embedded directly in the latent space of multi-modal generative models. While individual watermarking techniques exist for specific modalities (as shown in the literature review), the unified approach that works across text, images, videos, and audio represents a fresh perspective. The proposal's emphasis on embedding watermarks before content generation rather than post-generation is innovative. However, the basic mathematical formulation for watermark embedding (z_watermarked = z + α·w) is relatively standard in the field. The proposal could be more groundbreaking if it introduced novel mathematical techniques specifically designed for cross-modal contexts or provided more innovative approaches to the trade-off between imperceptibility and robustness beyond the scaling factor α."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The watermarking framework is well-grounded in established principles of latent space manipulation and information embedding. The mathematical formulation, while simple, is correct and appropriate for the task. The research design follows a systematic approach with clear stages from literature review to performance validation. The evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM, watermark extraction accuracy) are appropriate and well-justified for measuring imperceptibility and robustness. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and trade-offs, such as balancing imperceptibility with robustness. However, it could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential failure modes or theoretical limitations of the approach, particularly regarding the cross-modal transfer of watermark information and how the framework would handle adversarial attacks specifically designed to target cross-modal watermarks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The research design outlines a clear path from concept to implementation and evaluation. The required data (access to MMGMs, post-processing datasets) is reasonably obtainable, though access to state-of-the-art models like Sora might be restricted. The watermarking technique itself builds on established methods that have been proven effective in single-modal contexts. However, extending these techniques to cross-modal scenarios introduces significant complexity that may require considerable effort to overcome. The proposal acknowledges the need for robustness testing against various post-processing operations and adversarial attacks, which is realistic but potentially resource-intensive. The computational requirements for implementing and testing the framework across multiple modalities could be substantial, especially for video content, which might present scalability challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of AI-generated content: verifiable provenance across different modalities. As multi-modal generative models become more sophisticated and widespread, the ability to trace content back to its source is essential for combating misinformation, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring accountability. The cross-modal approach is particularly significant as it addresses a major gap in current watermarking techniques. The potential impact extends beyond technical contributions to broader societal benefits, including enhanced trust in AI systems, better tools for content verification, and support for regulatory frameworks. The proposal aligns perfectly with the task's focus on trustworthy multi-modal foundation models and directly addresses one of the listed topics (identifiers of AI-generated material). The expected outcomes would provide valuable tools for researchers, developers, and policymakers working to ensure responsible AI development."
