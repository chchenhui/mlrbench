    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on responsible AI for audio generation, specifically targeting text-to-speech synthesis with watermarking capabilities. The proposal comprehensively incorporates the core elements from the research idea, including steganographic watermarking in TTS latent spaces, diffusion models conditioned on text and watermark codes, and watermark extraction networks. The methodology thoroughly builds upon the literature review, citing relevant techniques like psychoacoustic masking from XAttnMark and AudioSeal, while addressing the identified challenges of imperceptibility vs. robustness and integration with generative models. The proposal also acknowledges ethical considerations mentioned in the literature review, making it highly consistent with all provided materials."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations that precisely define the watermarking process, diffusion model architecture, and extraction mechanisms. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined metrics and baselines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the watermark encoding function and the psychoacoustic masking model could be more explicitly connected, (2) some technical details about how the zero-shot detection would generalize to unseen models could be elaborated further, and (3) the transition between some subsections in the methodology could be smoother. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly understandable and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. First, it introduces a novel approach to embedding watermarks directly in the latent space of diffusion-based TTS models during the generation process, rather than as a post-processing step. Second, the integration of psychoacoustic masking with latent space manipulation represents an innovative combination of techniques. Third, the development of zero-shot watermark detection capabilities extends beyond current approaches mentioned in the literature review. While individual components like diffusion models for TTS and audio watermarking exist separately in prior work (as evidenced by the literature review), their integration into a unified framework with content-specific identifiers tied to input prompts represents a fresh perspective. The proposal builds upon existing techniques like those in XAttnMark and AudioSeal but extends them in meaningful ways, particularly in the context of generative TTS models."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The diffusion model formulation is mathematically rigorous and correctly specified, with appropriate conditioning mechanisms for both text and watermark information. The watermark encoding approach using orthogonal direction vectors in latent space is theoretically sound and builds on established principles in information hiding. The psychoacoustic masking model is well-grounded in auditory perception research. The training objectives for both the generative model and extraction network are properly formulated with clear loss functions. The experimental design includes appropriate metrics (PESQ, STOI, SNR, BER) and covers a comprehensive range of audio transformations and attacks. The proposal also includes ablation studies to validate component contributions. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented throughout, with proper notation and mathematical consistency."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic technical approaches and resource requirements. The implementation builds on established frameworks (PyTorch, NVIDIA NeMo) and architectures (Grad-TTS/VALL-E), making the development process practical. The datasets selected (VCTK, LJSpeech, LibriTTS, Common Voice) are publicly available and appropriate for the task. The computational requirements (8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) are substantial but reasonable for this type of research. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) achieving 98% watermark detection accuracy under various transformations may be optimistic given the challenges noted in the literature review, (2) balancing imperceptibility (<1dB quality degradation) with robustness to adversarial attacks presents significant technical challenges, and (3) the zero-shot generalization capabilities may require more extensive training data than specified. The timeline for implementation is not explicitly provided, which makes it difficult to assess the temporal feasibility. Overall, while ambitious, the proposal is implementable with current technology and methods, though some objectives may require adjustment based on experimental outcomes."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem with far-reaching implications for media integrity, personal identity protection, and responsible AI deployment. As synthetic speech becomes increasingly indistinguishable from human speech, the ability to verify content provenance is essential for maintaining trust in digital communications. The research directly tackles challenges identified in the literature review regarding deepfake detection and ethical AI deployment. The potential impact spans multiple domains: (1) technical advancement in watermarking and verification methods, (2) industry standards for responsible AI voice generation, (3) forensic tools for legal and journalistic verification, and (4) policy frameworks for synthetic media regulation. The proposal goes beyond incremental improvements to establish a new paradigm of proactive authentication rather than reactive detection. The expected outcomes would provide tangible solutions to pressing societal concerns while advancing the scientific understanding of latent space steganography and cross-modal verification. The comprehensive consideration of ethical implications further enhances the significance of this work."
