    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the Audio Imagination workshop's focus on responsible AI for audio generation, specifically targeting text-to-speech synthesis with embedded accountability mechanisms. The StegaDiff framework implements the steganographic watermarking concept outlined in the research idea, aiming for the same technical specifications (98% detection accuracy with <1dB distortion). The proposal thoroughly incorporates the literature, building upon works like XAttnMark, AudioSeal, and diffusion-based watermarking mentioned in the review. The methodology section clearly demonstrates how the proposal extends existing approaches by integrating watermarking directly into the diffusion-based TTS pipeline, addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, including mathematical formulations of the diffusion process, loss functions, and watermarking mechanisms. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are comprehensively outlined. The pseudo-code algorithm provides a clear implementation path. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for how the watermark code is generated or selected is not fully specified, (2) some technical details about the watermark extraction network architecture could be more precise, and (3) the relationship between the psychoacoustic model and the masking matrix M could be further elaborated. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing an end-to-end steganographic watermarking framework integrated directly into diffusion-based TTS models. While audio watermarking itself is not new (as evidenced by cited works like XAttnMark and AudioSeal), the innovation lies in the joint training of the diffusion model with watermark embedding and extraction, creating a unified pipeline. The approach of conditioning the denoising process on both text and watermark codes represents a fresh perspective. The psychoacoustic-weighted imperceptibility loss and the zero-shot detection capability are also innovative elements. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing diffusion TTS models and watermarking techniques rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The diffusion process formulation is mathematically sound, and the three-part loss function (diffusion reconstruction, watermark extraction, and imperceptibility) is well-justified. The training procedure and experimental design follow established scientific practices. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and appropriate for the task. The proposal also acknowledges the imperceptibility-robustness trade-off identified in the literature review and addresses it through hyperparameter tuning. The inclusion of human listening tests further strengthens the evaluation methodology. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions robustness to various distortions, the theoretical guarantees for this robustness could be more thoroughly developed. Overall, the technical approach is well-founded and rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The use of public datasets (VCTK, FS2) and building upon established diffusion TTS models increases practicality. The training procedure is well-specified, with reasonable hyperparameters and computational requirements (4 GPUs for 200k steps). The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some implementation challenges that might affect feasibility: (1) jointly optimizing for three different objectives (diffusion quality, watermark detectability, and imperceptibility) could be difficult to balance in practice, (2) achieving the targeted 98% detection accuracy under various distortions is ambitious and may require significant tuning, and (3) the zero-shot generalization capability might be harder to achieve than anticipated. While these challenges are substantial, they don't render the proposal impractical, but rather represent realistic research hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of generative AI for audio: the lack of accountability and verification mechanisms for synthetic speech. This work has far-reaching implications for combating audio deepfakes, protecting voice identity, and establishing trust in digital media. The potential impact spans multiple domains including journalism, legal systems, and responsible AI deployment. By creating an open-source benchmark and standardized evaluation protocols, the research could significantly influence how the field approaches verification of synthetic audio. The proposal directly responds to the growing concern about AI-generated misinformation highlighted in the task description and literature review. The focus on both technical excellence (high detection accuracy, low audio distortion) and practical application (integration into existing pipelines) further enhances its significance. This work could establish a foundation for trustworthy generative audio technologies."
