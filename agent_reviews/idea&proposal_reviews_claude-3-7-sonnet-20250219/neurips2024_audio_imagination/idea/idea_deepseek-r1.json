    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CAM-Eval framework aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Methods for Evaluation of Generated Audio' topic. It also touches on multimodal aspects (audio-text-video), VR/AR applications, and responsibility in generative AIâ€”all explicitly mentioned in the task description. The proposal recognizes the unique challenges of audio perception and its relationship with other modalities, which is a central theme of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't directly address some other topics like LLMs or speech enhancement, though it provides a framework that could be applied to those areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main components, and expected outcomes. The three main components of the framework (contrastive embeddings, human perceptual metrics, and task-specific objectives) are distinctly outlined. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific implementation details of the contrastive embeddings, how the human feedback will be collected and integrated systematically, and what exact metrics will constitute the standardized benchmarks. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by proposing a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines multiple approaches (contrastive learning, human feedback, and task-specific metrics) specifically for multimodal audio generation. The focus on context-awareness and cross-modal coherence is particularly innovative. However, each individual component (contrastive embeddings, human evaluation, task-specific metrics) has precedents in other domains. The novelty lies in their integration and application to audio generation rather than in introducing fundamentally new evaluation paradigms. The approach builds upon existing evaluation methods but adapts them thoughtfully to the unique challenges of audio generation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Creating robust contrastive embeddings across three modalities (audio, text, video) is technically complex. Collecting high-quality human feedback at scale will require significant resources and careful experimental design to ensure reliability and consistency. Developing task-specific metrics for VR immersion that correlate with user experience is also challenging. The framework requires extensive datasets with multimodal annotations, which may not be readily available. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively represent substantial hurdles that would require considerable time, expertise, and resources to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical gap in audio generation evaluation, which currently relies on metrics that don't capture perceptual quality or cross-modal coherence. Improved evaluation methods could significantly accelerate progress in generative audio AI by providing more meaningful optimization targets. The potential impact extends to creative applications, VR/AR experiences, and other multimodal systems where audio plays a crucial role. The standardized benchmarks would enable more rigorous comparison of models and potentially lead to more responsible development practices. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of audio in immersive technologies and creative applications, though it may have somewhat less impact on more traditional audio processing tasks."
