    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on multimodal generation of audio, specifically targeting the integration of textual and visual inputs for audio generation. The proposal explicitly mentions applications in virtual/augmented reality and synchronized generation of audio with visuals, which are specific topics listed in the workshop call. The idea also touches on content creation technologies, which is another listed topic. The only minor reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that it doesn't explicitly address some secondary aspects like evaluation methods or responsibility in generative AI that are mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, methodology, and expected outcomes. The proposed 'Multimodal Audio Synthesis (MAS)' framework is defined with its key components (text encoder, visual encoder, and audio decoder). However, there are some ambiguities that prevent a higher score. The proposal lacks specific details on the architecture of these encoders/decoders, the exact training methodology, and how the synchronization between modalities would be achieved technically. It also doesn't specify what types of visual inputs would be processed (e.g., images, videos, 3D scenes) or what kinds of audio outputs would be generated (speech, environmental sounds, music, etc.)."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates moderate novelty. While multimodal approaches to AI are not new, and there are existing works on text-to-audio and visual-to-audio generation, the explicit integration of both text and visual inputs for audio generation is less common. However, the proposal doesn't clearly articulate how this approach differs from existing multimodal systems or what specific innovations it brings to the field. The concept of combining multiple modalities for generation is becoming increasingly common in AI research, and without more specific technical innovations or unique approaches to the integration problem, the novelty is somewhat limited. The proposal would benefit from highlighting specific novel techniques or architectures that differentiate it from existing multimodal systems."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with current technology and methods. The components required (text encoders, visual encoders, audio decoders) all exist in various forms, and there are established techniques for multimodal learning. The supervised learning approach with synchronized datasets is reasonable. However, there are challenges that aren't fully addressed: obtaining large-scale synchronized audio-text-visual datasets could be difficult; ensuring temporal alignment across modalities is non-trivial; and the computational resources required for training such a multimodal system could be substantial. The proposal acknowledges the need for synchronized data but doesn't detail how these challenges would be overcome, which prevents a higher feasibility score."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses an important area with clear potential impact. Multimodal audio generation has significant applications in VR/AR, gaming, education, and entertainment as mentioned in the proposal. Improving the realism, coherence, and contextual appropriateness of generated audio would meaningfully advance these fields. The ability to generate audio that responds appropriately to both textual and visual contexts could enable more immersive and natural interactions in various applications. The significance is enhanced by the growing importance of multimodal AI systems and immersive technologies. However, the proposal could more explicitly discuss how the advances would compare to or improve upon current state-of-the-art approaches to better establish its significance."
