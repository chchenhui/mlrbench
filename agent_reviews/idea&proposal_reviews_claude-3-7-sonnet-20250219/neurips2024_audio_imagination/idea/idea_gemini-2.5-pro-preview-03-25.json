        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Video to Audio Generation' and 'Multimodal generation of audio' topics explicitly mentioned in the workshop call. The proposal also touches on 'Synchronized Generation of audio along with visuals' by emphasizing temporal synchronization between visual content and generated audio. The cross-modal approach using both video and text inputs perfectly fits the workshop's focus on 'going beyond unimodal inputs to audio.' The idea is highly relevant to the Audio Imagination workshop's goals of advancing generative AI for audio."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (integrating diverse inputs for audio generation), proposes a specific solution (cross-modal attention fusion), and outlines the technical approach (separate encoders followed by cross-attention layers and an audio decoder). The architecture is well-defined at a high level. However, some implementation details remain somewhat abstract - for instance, the specific architecture of the fusion module could be more precisely defined, and the exact mechanism for ensuring temporal synchronization between video and audio could be elaborated further. Despite these minor ambiguities, the core concept is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to multimodal audio generation. While cross-modal attention mechanisms have been explored in other domains, their specific application to joint video-text conditioning for audio generation appears to be relatively unexplored territory. The fusion approach that allows bidirectional attention between modalities is a fresh perspective. However, the individual components (pre-trained video models, language models, and audio diffusion/transformer decoders) are established technologies, and cross-modal attention itself is not a new concept. The innovation lies in the specific combination and application rather than introducing fundamentally new architectural paradigms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research is highly feasible with current technology. All the core components (video encoders, language models, cross-attention mechanisms, and audio decoders) are well-established in the field. The approach builds on existing architectures rather than requiring entirely new frameworks. The main implementation challenges would likely involve dataset creation/curation (finding paired video-text-audio data) and computational resources for training such a multimodal model. Temporal alignment between video and generated audio might present some technical challenges, but these are surmountable with existing techniques. Overall, the idea could be implemented with current resources and knowledge, though it would require significant but reasonable computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses an important gap in current audio generation systems. The ability to generate contextually appropriate audio conditioned on both visual and textual information has significant applications in film production, game development, virtual reality, content creation, and accessibility technologies. If successful, this approach could lead to more immersive multimedia experiences and reduce the need for manual audio engineering in various contexts. The impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in creative industries. The significance is enhanced by the growing importance of multimodal AI systems that can process and generate content across different modalities in contextually coherent ways."
