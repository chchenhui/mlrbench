    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on synergizing reasoning and decision-making in open-world environments through the DKR2A architecture that integrates LLM-based reasoning with RL-based control. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the hybrid architecture, dynamic knowledge repository, and contrastive learning for alignment. It also builds upon the literature review by citing and extending works like Chen et al. (2025), Carta et al. (2023), Feng et al. (2023), and Qi et al. (2024). The proposal addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as adaptation to unseen tasks, efficient knowledge transfer, balancing exploration with exploitation, and minimizing human supervision. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions societal considerations like regulation and existential risks, the proposal only briefly touches on ethical considerations in section 3.3."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The architecture is precisely defined with formal mathematical notation, and the training procedure is presented as a clear algorithm. The figures and equations enhance understanding of the complex integration between modules. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for pruning older experiences from memory based on 'relevance' is not fully specified; (2) The proposal mentions 'planar annotations' in the training algorithm without previously defining this term; (3) While the contrastive alignment loss is formally defined, the practical implementation of how subgoal embeddings from the LLM are matched with state representations in the RL policy could be elaborated further. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The DKR2A architecture introduces an innovative approach to integrating symbolic reasoning with reinforcement learning through a dynamic knowledge repository, which goes beyond existing methods that treat these components in isolation or use brittle hand-crafted pipelines. The contrastive alignment mechanism for bridging LLM subgoal representations with RL state embeddings is particularly novel and addresses a critical gap in current systems. The dynamic memory module that continuously updates with new experiences and uses relevance-based pruning represents an advancement over static knowledge bases. While individual components like LLMs for planning and RL for execution have been explored separately in works cited in the literature review, their tight integration through shared representations and joint training is innovative. The proposal builds upon rather than merely extends existing approaches like LOOP (Chen et al., 2025), LLaMA-Rider (Feng et al., 2023), and WebRL (Qi et al., 2024), offering a more comprehensive solution to open-world agent challenges."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in established theoretical frameworks. The formulation of the problem as an MDP drawn from a distribution is appropriate for open-world settings. The mathematical formulations for the LLM reasoner, RL executor, and contrastive alignment are technically correct and clearly presented. The training procedure combines established methods (PPO, contrastive learning) in a principled way. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) The proposal assumes that the LLM can generate meaningful subgoals without direct environmental feedback, which may not always hold in novel environments; (2) The memory retrieval mechanism using k-nearest neighbors is straightforward but may not scale optimally to very large memory stores; (3) The proposal does not fully address potential distribution shifts between training and deployment environments; (4) While the contrastive alignment approach is promising, there's limited discussion of how it handles the semantic gap between language and state representations. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and builds on well-established techniques in both symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach but with several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the individual components (LLM, RL policy, memory module) are based on existing technologies, and the environments (Minecraft, MuJoCo) are established benchmarks. The implementation details are specific, including model sizes, learning rates, and hardware requirements. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The computational resources required are substantial (64 TPU cores, 512 CPU workers), which may limit reproducibility; (2) Training a 7B-13B parameter LLM with contrastive alignment to RL state representations is computationally intensive and may face optimization challenges; (3) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the potential mismatch between LLM-generated subgoals and what's actually achievable in the environment; (4) The memory capacity of 50,000 tuples may be insufficient for truly open-world settings with diverse tasks; (5) The joint training of symbolic and subsymbolic systems has historically been challenging due to different optimization landscapes. While the approach is implementable with current technology, these challenges suggest moderate rather than high feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI research: the integration of reasoning and decision-making capabilities for open-world agents. This challenge is at the heart of the workshop's focus and represents a fundamental step toward more general AI systems. The potential impact is substantial across multiple domains: (1) In robotics, agents that can reason about novel tools and environments could transform disaster response and industrial automation; (2) In game AI, more natural and creative NPC behaviors would enhance player experiences; (3) For LLM-driven automation, the ability to plan and execute multi-stage tasks with minimal supervision could revolutionize workflow automation. The expected outcomes of 15% improvement in success rate on unseen tasks and 30% reduction in sample complexity would represent significant advances in the field. The proposal also contributes methodologically by providing a blueprint for unifying symbolic and subsymbolic capabilities, which could influence future research directions. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's focus on minimizing human supervision and enabling continual learning, addressing key bottlenecks in current AI systems."
