        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on synergizing reasoning and decision-making in open-world environments by proposing a hybrid architecture that integrates LLMs for reasoning with RL for decision-making. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the dynamic knowledge repository, contrastive learning for alignment, and applications in domains like robotics and game AI. It also builds upon the literature review by referencing relevant works (e.g., LOOP, LLaMA-Rider, WebRL) and addressing the identified challenges of knowledge transfer, adaptation to unseen tasks, and minimizing human supervision. The methodology section provides detailed technical approaches that align with both the task requirements and the research idea's vision."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to expected outcomes. The architecture is explained in detail with specific components (LLM-Based Reasoning Module, RL-Based Decision-Making Module, Dynamic Knowledge Repository, Contrastive Alignment Layer) and their interactions. The mathematical formulations for LLM pretraining, RL training, and contrastive alignment are precisely defined. The experimental design outlines specific environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for updating the knowledge repository could be more detailed, (2) the process for determining 'novelty' and 'uncertainty' in the experience replay prioritization could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'temporal knowledge graph') are introduced without full explanation of their implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in its approach to integrating reasoning and decision-making for open-world agents. The dynamic knowledge repository that facilitates bidirectional information flow between LLM reasoning and RL decision-making represents a fresh perspective on agent architecture. The contrastive alignment layer for bridging symbolic and subsymbolic representations is innovative. The proposal's emphasis on continuous knowledge integration and self-supervised learning for minimizing human supervision also distinguishes it from many existing approaches. However, while the individual components (LLMs, RL, knowledge graphs) are not new, and similar hybrid architectures have been explored in recent literature (as evidenced by the cited works like LOOP and LLaMA-Rider), the specific combination and implementation details provide incremental rather than revolutionary innovation. The proposal builds upon existing paradigms rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for LLM pretraining, RL training with PPO, and contrastive learning are correctly presented and well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, diverse environments, and relevant evaluation metrics. The approach to knowledge integration via experience replay with priority and knowledge graph updates is theoretically sound. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and incorporates mechanisms to address them (e.g., uncertainty-aware exploration for ethical robustness). However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the exact mechanism for ensuring that the LLM-generated plans are executable by the RL policy, (2) how the system handles potential conflicts between LLM reasoning and RL feedback, and (3) the theoretical guarantees for convergence in the joint training process. Overall, the proposal is technically sound but has some areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction with realistic implementation paths, though with moderate challenges. The use of existing simulation environments (Minecraft, AI2-THOR, ProcTHOR) provides practical testbeds for the proposed methods. The component technologies (LLMs, RL algorithms, contrastive learning) are well-established with available implementations. The evaluation metrics are measurable and appropriate for assessing progress. However, several implementation challenges exist: (1) computational resources required for training both LLMs and RL agents may be substantial, (2) aligning symbolic reasoning with subsymbolic representations through contrastive learning may prove difficult in practice, (3) the dynamic knowledge repository may face scalability issues as experiences accumulate, and (4) the proposed 20-50% improvements over baselines are ambitious given the complexity of open-world environments. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do suggest that full implementation may require significant engineering effort and potential scope adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI research: developing agents capable of both reasoning and decision-making in open-world environments. If successful, this work could significantly advance the field by providing a unified framework that bridges symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning, potentially enabling more capable and adaptable AI systems. The expected outcomes—improved generalization, reduced sample complexity, emergent multi-task completion, and ethical robustness—would represent meaningful contributions to the field. The proposed applications in disaster response robotics, personalized AI assistants, and game AI highlight practical impact areas. The commitment to open-sourcing the framework and simulation benchmarks further enhances the potential impact by enabling broader research participation. While the proposal may not completely solve the open-world agent challenge, it represents a substantial step forward in addressing key limitations of current approaches and could inspire new research directions in unified reasoning-decision-making paradigms."
