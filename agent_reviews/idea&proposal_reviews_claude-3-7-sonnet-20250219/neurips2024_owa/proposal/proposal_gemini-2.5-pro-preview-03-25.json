    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on synergizing reasoning and decision-making in open-world environments by proposing the DKDRL framework that integrates LLMs for reasoning with RL for decision-making. The proposal explicitly addresses all five key challenges identified in the literature review: integration complexity, generalization bottleneck, inefficient knowledge management, exploration vs. reasoning balance, and supervision dependency. The methodology section thoroughly details how the three-component architecture (LLM Reasoner, RL Agent, and Dynamic Knowledge Repository) works together to tackle these challenges. The proposal also engages with the specific scientific questions posed in the workshop description, such as how to unify reasoning and decision-making, how knowledge plays a role, how to minimize supervision, and how to measure generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The introduction effectively establishes the background, problem statement, research objectives, and significance. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the overall architecture, each component's function, and their integration. Mathematical formulations for the RL objective, reward structure, and contrastive learning loss are precisely defined. The experimental design, including baselines, evaluation tasks, and metrics, is comprehensively outlined. However, there are a few areas where clarity could be improved: (1) some technical details about the DKR implementation could be more specific, particularly regarding the exact mechanisms for knowledge extraction and integration; (2) the description of how the LLM-generated subgoals are translated into a form usable by the RL policy could benefit from more concrete examples; and (3) the proposal could more explicitly define success criteria for the evaluation metrics."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to integrating reasoning and decision-making for open-world agents. The DKDRL framework's key innovation lies in the Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR) that serves as a mediating structure between the LLM and RL components, enabling bidirectional knowledge flow and continuous updating. The contrastive alignment mechanism for aligning LLM-generated subgoal representations with RL state representations is also a novel contribution. However, the individual components (LLMs for planning, RL for execution, knowledge repositories) have been explored in prior work, as acknowledged in the literature review. The proposal builds upon existing approaches like those in references [1-4], extending and combining them rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms. While the integration approach is innovative, it represents an evolution of existing ideas rather than a revolutionary breakthrough."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The RL component is well-grounded in established algorithms like PPO and SAC, with properly formulated objective functions. The contrastive learning mechanism for alignment between LLM and RL representations is mathematically sound and builds on proven techniques. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, diverse evaluation tasks, and relevant metrics to assess performance. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, showing awareness of technical hurdles. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the mechanism for determining subgoal achievement (the indicator function I(g_i)) could benefit from more formal definition; (2) the proposal could more explicitly address potential issues with LLM hallucination affecting planning quality; and (3) while the DKR concept is sound, more formal analysis of its theoretical properties (e.g., convergence guarantees, information-theoretic aspects) would enhance the technical depth."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components and implementation strategies. The use of established simulation environments (Minecraft, robotics simulators) provides practical testbeds for the proposed approach. The individual components (LLMs, RL algorithms, vector/graph databases for the DKR) are all existing technologies that can be integrated as described. The experimental design is well-structured and achievable. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) computational requirements for training both LLM and RL components could be substantial, potentially requiring significant resources; (2) the real-time interaction between LLM reasoning and RL execution may face latency issues, especially if LLM inference is slow; (3) designing effective reward functions for subgoal achievement in complex environments like Minecraft can be difficult; and (4) the integration of the three components (LLM, RL, DKR) involves considerable engineering complexity. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present meaningful hurdles that would require careful management and potentially some scope adjustments during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI research: creating agents that can effectively combine reasoning and decision-making in open-world environments. This directly aligns with the workshop's central themes and has broad implications for advancing the field. If successful, the DKDRL framework could significantly improve generalization capabilities, sample efficiency, and long-horizon task completion for autonomous agents. The potential applications span multiple domains including robotics, game AI, autonomous systems, and personalized AI assistants, as clearly articulated in the proposal. The research could provide valuable insights into the integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches to AI, contributing to our understanding of how to build more generally capable systems. The proposal also addresses important challenges like reducing supervision requirements and enabling knowledge transfer, which are crucial for scaling AI capabilities. While the immediate impact might be primarily in research contexts and simulated environments rather than real-world deployment, the conceptual and methodological contributions could substantially influence future directions in open-world agent development."
