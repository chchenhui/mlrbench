        "justification": "The RL-CoT idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on open-world agents that can simultaneously perform reasoning and decision-making. It directly addresses the challenge of interleaving reasoning (via LLM-based chain-of-thought) with decision-making (via hierarchical RL policies). The proposal specifically targets open-world environments with procedurally generated 3D simulation tasks, which matches the workshop's interest in agents that can operate in diverse, dynamic settings. The idea also addresses several key questions posed in the workshop description, particularly how to unify reasoning and decision-making, how to plan in unseen scenarios, and how to achieve open-world capabilities with minimal supervision through self-supervised fine-tuning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure that outlines the motivation, approach, and expected outcomes. The core mechanism of interleaving LLM-based reasoning with RL-based control is well-defined, as is the feedback loop for refining the chain-of-thought reasoning. The hierarchical structure of the RL policy and the dynamic replay buffer concept are also clearly presented. However, some minor ambiguities exist: the exact nature of the 'specialized sub-policies' could be elaborated further, and more details on how the self-supervised fine-tuning works would strengthen the clarity. The evaluation methodology is mentioned but could benefit from more specific metrics or benchmarks."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "RL-CoT presents a novel integration of two powerful paradigms: chain-of-thought reasoning from LLMs and hierarchical reinforcement learning. While both LLMs for reasoning and RL for control have been explored separately, the dynamic interleaving of these approaches with a feedback loop for continuous improvement represents a fresh perspective. The dynamic replay buffer that prioritizes high-quality reasoning traces is an innovative component. The approach of using environment feedback to refine LLM reasoning is particularly novel. The idea doesn't completely reinvent either field but creates a new synthesis that addresses limitations of both approaches in open-world settings. This combination appears to be a meaningful advancement beyond existing work in either domain alone."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach builds on established techniques in both LLM reasoning and reinforcement learning, which increases its feasibility. The components required (LLMs, RL algorithms, hierarchical policies) all exist and have been demonstrated separately. However, there are significant implementation challenges: (1) effectively integrating LLM outputs into RL policy conditioning may require careful engineering, (2) designing the feedback mechanism from environment interactions back to LLM fine-tuning is non-trivial, (3) the computational resources required for both LLM inference/fine-tuning and RL training in 3D environments could be substantial. The dynamic replay buffer concept, while innovative, would need careful design to effectively prioritize reasoning traces. Overall, the idea is feasible but would require considerable expertise and resources to implement successfully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: bridging symbolic reasoning with grounded decision-making in open-world environments. If successful, it could significantly advance the field of embodied AI by creating agents that can both reason abstractly and act concretely in novel situations. The approach has broad potential applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and virtual agents that must operate in unpredictable environments. The interpretability aspect is particularly significant, as the chain-of-thought reasoning provides transparency into the agent's decision-making process, addressing a key concern in modern AI systems. The sample efficiency improvements could also make complex agent training more accessible. The work directly contributes to the workshop's core focus on unifying reasoning and decision-making for open-world agents."
