        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 workshop's focus on 'Scaling up optimization' by investigating learning rate scaling laws for LLMs. The proposal incorporates the core elements from the research idea, developing a systematic approach to derive adaptive learning rate scaling laws based on model architecture and size, integrating spectral analysis with empirical observations. The literature review is thoroughly leveraged, with references to recent work on hyperparameter scaling laws (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024; Bjorck et al., 2024) and broader scaling research. The proposal acknowledges existing approaches while identifying specific gaps to address, particularly the need for a deeper mechanistic understanding connecting scaling laws to model architecture and optimization landscape dynamics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research problem is precisely defined, with specific gaps in current approaches identified. The four-phase methodology is logically organized, detailing data collection, model architectures, empirical study procedures, scaling law formulation, validation approaches, and tool development. The mathematical formulations for potential scaling laws are explicitly presented. The only minor areas that could benefit from further clarification are: (1) more specific details on the computational resources required and how they will be managed, and (2) slightly more concrete examples of the spectral analysis techniques in practice. Overall, the proposal presents a comprehensive and understandable research plan with minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating spectral analysis of the Hessian with empirical scaling laws for learning rates in LLMs. While scaling laws for hyperparameters have been explored (as noted in the literature review), the proposal's innovation lies in connecting these empirical observations to the underlying optimization landscape through spectral properties. The approach of systematically varying model dimensions (width, depth) to isolate their effects on optimal learning rates is relatively fresh. The proposal also introduces architecture-aware adjustments to scaling laws, which extends beyond simple parameter counts used in existing work. However, the core concept of deriving power-law relationships for hyperparameters builds upon established work, and some of the spectral analysis techniques mentioned are adaptations of existing methods rather than entirely new approaches. The novelty is in the integration and application rather than fundamentally new theoretical constructs."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. It builds on well-established theoretical foundations in optimization theory, particularly the relationship between Hessian eigenvalues and optimal step sizes. The methodology for spectral analysis is grounded in proven techniques (Power Iteration, Lanczos algorithm, Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature) with appropriate citations. The experimental design is systematic, controlling for confounding variables and including appropriate baselines for comparison. The statistical approach to model selection using standard criteria (R-squared, AIC, BIC) is methodologically sound. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and challenges. One minor weakness is that while the hypothesis that optimal learning rate is inversely proportional to the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is theoretically justified for simple optimization problems, the proposal could more thoroughly address how this relationship might be complicated in the non-convex, high-dimensional landscapes of LLMs. Overall, the technical foundations are solid with only minor gaps."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a somewhat feasible research plan, but with significant implementation challenges. The strengths include a well-structured, phased approach and the use of established techniques for spectral analysis. However, several practical concerns affect feasibility: (1) Computing Hessian spectral properties for large models is computationally intensive, even with the proposed approximation methods. The proposal acknowledges this but doesn't fully address how to make this tractable for very large models. (2) The validation phase requires training several large LLMs (potentially >10B parameters), which demands substantial computational resources that may not be accessible to many research teams. (3) The timeline for completing all four phases is not specified, but the scope suggests a multi-year project requiring significant resources. (4) While the methodology for deriving scaling laws is clear, the success of the approach depends on whether clean, predictable relationships actually exist between model dimensions and optimal learning rates across architectures. The proposal would benefit from contingency plans if the hypothesized relationships prove more complex than anticipated. These challenges don't make the research impossible, but they do present substantial hurdles to full implementation as described."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in modern AI research. Efficient training of LLMs is a critical bottleneck in advancing the field, with enormous financial and environmental costs at stake. The potential impact of reducing hyperparameter tuning costs by 25-40% would represent substantial savings in computational resources, energy consumption, and research time. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's focus on scaling laws and optimization. Beyond the immediate practical benefits, the research could provide valuable theoretical insights into the relationship between model architecture, optimization landscapes, and training dynamics. The open-source tool would benefit the broader research community, potentially democratizing access to LLM research by reducing the computational barrier to entry. While the significance is high, it falls short of transformative (9-10) because similar goals are being pursued by multiple research groups (as evidenced in the literature review), and the expected improvements, while substantial, represent an evolution rather than a revolution in training methodology."
