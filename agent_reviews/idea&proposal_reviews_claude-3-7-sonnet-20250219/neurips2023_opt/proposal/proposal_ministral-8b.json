        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Scaling up optimization' for LLMs and tackles the specific challenge of developing model size-dependent learning rates to reduce training costs and environmental impact. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including the integration of spectral analysis of the Hessian with empirical observations to establish mathematical relationships between learning rates and model dimensions. The literature review is well-utilized, with the proposal building upon existing work on scaling laws and optimization hyperparameters for LLMs. The methodology, mathematical formulation, and expected outcomes are all consistent with the task requirements and research objectives."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are explicitly defined and logically organized. The mathematical formulation provides a concrete representation of the proposed approach, including the relationship between learning rates and model parameters. The algorithmic steps outline a clear path for implementation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the specific datasets to be used for training and validation could be more precisely defined, (2) the exact mechanisms for extrapolating from small to large models could be elaborated further, and (3) more details on the implementation of the open-source library would strengthen the proposal. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating spectral analysis of the Hessian with empirical observations to establish mathematical relationships between learning rates and model dimensions. While the literature review shows that scaling laws for hyperparameters in LLM training have been studied before (e.g., papers 1 and 2), this proposal offers a fresh perspective by combining theoretical analysis with practical implementation in an open-source library. The approach of using smaller models to predict optimal learning rates for larger ones is innovative and potentially impactful. However, the core idea builds upon existing work rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, and some aspects (like using the Hessian for learning rate adaptation) have precedents in optimization literature. The novelty lies more in the systematic integration and practical application than in fundamentally new theoretical concepts."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in optimization theory. The mathematical formulation using the Hessian matrix and its eigenvalues to estimate learning rate sensitivity is theoretically justified and follows established principles in optimization. The experimental design includes appropriate validation steps and evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The methodology incorporates both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, providing a robust framework for deriving adaptive learning rate scaling laws. The connection between spectral properties of the Hessian and optimal learning rates is well-established in optimization literature. The proposal could be strengthened by more detailed discussion of potential limitations or edge cases where the proposed scaling laws might not apply, but overall, the technical foundations are solid."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps. Training smaller models to extrapolate learning rates for larger ones is a practical approach that reduces the computational burden compared to exhaustive hyperparameter searches for large models. The algorithmic steps outline a reasonable implementation path. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) computing the full Hessian for large models is computationally expensive and may require approximation methods not fully detailed in the proposal, (2) the extrapolation from small to large models assumes a consistent relationship that may not hold across all scales, and (3) the 25-40% reduction in training time claimed in the introduction would benefit from more substantiation. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and methods, particularly if approximation techniques for Hessian computation are employed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in LLM training: the enormous computational cost and environmental impact. By developing systematic methods to predict optimal learning rates based on model size, the research could significantly reduce the resources required for training large models. The potential 25-40% reduction in training time for billion-parameter models would translate to substantial cost savings and reduced environmental impact. The open-source implementation would make these benefits widely accessible to the research community and industry. The work aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on scaling up optimization and could contribute meaningfully to more efficient AI development. The significance is further enhanced by the growing importance of LLMs in various applications and the increasing concern about their environmental footprint."
