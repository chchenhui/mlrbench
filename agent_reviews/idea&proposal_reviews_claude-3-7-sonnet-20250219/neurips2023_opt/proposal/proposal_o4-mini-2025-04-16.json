        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 workshop's focus on 'Scaling up optimization' by developing scaling laws for learning rates in LLM training. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including the systematic approach to derive adaptive learning rate scaling laws based on model architecture and size, integration of Hessian spectral analysis, and the goal of reducing training costs by 25-40%. The literature review is thoroughly leveraged, with explicit references to recent works (Li et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024; Bjorck et al., 2024) that have begun exploring power-law scaling relationships. The proposal's methodology and expected outcomes align perfectly with the workshop's topics on adaptive stochastic methods, deep learning optimization, and scaling laws."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are precisely defined with bullet points, and the methodology is logically organized into four distinct stages. The mathematical formulations are presented rigorously, with clear notation and explanations of the power-law form and its logarithmic transformation for regression. The pseudocode for the algorithmic framework provides a concrete implementation plan. The expected outcomes and broader impact sections clearly communicate the anticipated contributions. However, there are a few minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the curvature-based estimate and the power-law model could be more explicitly explained, (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'Huber regression') are used without brief explanations, and (3) the validation metrics could be more precisely defined with specific thresholds for success."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining theoretical insights from Hessian spectral analysis with empirical power-law scaling to create a comprehensive framework for learning rate prediction. While individual components (power-law scaling, Hessian analysis) have been explored in prior work cited in the literature review, the integration of these approaches into a unified framework with cross-architecture generalization is innovative. The proposal extends beyond existing work by: (1) deriving closed-form scaling laws as a function of multiple variables (N, D, S, B), (2) incorporating curvature information from Hessian spectral analysis, and (3) developing an end-to-end library for practical implementation. However, the core idea of learning rate scaling laws is not entirely new, as evidenced by the cited works from Li et al., Xie et al., and Bjorck et al., which reduces the novelty score somewhat."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The methodology is rigorous, combining empirical data collection with theoretical analysis of Hessian eigenvalues. The connection between curvature and learning rate stability is mathematically justified through the relationship η_max(t) ≈ 2(1-β)/λ_max(t). The power-law formulation is well-motivated by prior work, and the logarithmic transformation for regression is statistically sound. The validation approach includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component. The cross-validation strategy helps ensure the reliability of the fitted parameters. However, there are some minor gaps: (1) the proposal could more thoroughly address potential limitations of the quadratic approximation in non-convex settings, (2) the adjustment for Adam-style optimizers is mentioned but not fully elaborated, and (3) the assumption that λ_max(t) stabilizes after a few hundred steps may need more justification for very large models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The staged approach—starting with smaller models before scaling to billion-parameter LLMs—is pragmatic and reduces initial computational demands. The use of established methods like Lanczos algorithm for Hessian eigenvalue estimation is practical. The data collection phase with controlled settings across different model configurations is well-designed and implementable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) computing Hessian eigenvalues for large models can be computationally expensive, even with stochastic approximations, (2) the validation on 1B-10B parameter models will require substantial computational resources, (3) the cross-architecture generalization to vision transformers introduces additional complexity, and (4) the ambitious goal of 25-40% reduction in training time may be challenging to achieve consistently across different model scales and architectures. Despite these challenges, the overall approach remains feasible with appropriate resources and potential adjustments to the scope if needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in modern AI research: the enormous computational and financial costs of training large language models. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions. First, the economic impact could be transformative—reducing training time by 25-40% for billion-parameter models would translate to millions of dollars in savings for large-scale AI research. Second, the environmental benefits are significant, with reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions from more efficient training. Third, the democratization aspect is crucial—by eliminating costly hyperparameter searches, the research could make LLM training more accessible to smaller labs and organizations with limited resources. Fourth, the theoretical contributions to understanding optimization in high-dimensional non-convex settings have broad implications for the field of machine learning optimization. The open-source library deliverable ensures practical impact beyond theoretical insights. The alignment with current industry and research priorities in efficient AI scaling further enhances its significance."
