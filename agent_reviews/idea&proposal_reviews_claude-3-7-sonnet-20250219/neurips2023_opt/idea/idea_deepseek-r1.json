        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the core focus of OPT 2024 on 'Scaling up optimization' by investigating how optimization algorithms influence scaling laws. The proposal specifically targets questions raised in the task description, such as 'How dependent are these scaling laws on the optimization algorithm?' and aims to develop model size dependent learning rates that allow extrapolation from smaller models to larger ones. The idea also addresses the environmental and cost concerns mentioned in the task by potentially reducing hyperparameter search costs by 50%+. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some secondary topics like federated learning or privacy, but these are optional areas according to the task description."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. It clearly articulates the motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The three-step approach (systematic experiments, theoretical model development, and creation of a scaling-aware optimizer selection protocol) provides a well-defined roadmap. The concept of 'algorithm-dependent scaling exponents' is introduced and the practical applications are specified. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, how exactly the theoretical model will link optimizer dynamics to scaling behavior, or what specific metrics will be used to quantify the relationship between optimizers and scaling laws. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates excellent originality by addressing a significant gap in current scaling law research. While scaling laws for model size, data, and compute have been extensively studied, the systematic investigation of how optimization algorithms affect these laws represents a novel direction. The proposed 'scaling-aware optimizer selection protocol' appears to be a new concept that could significantly advance the field. The research doesn't merely apply existing techniques but aims to develop new theoretical frameworks linking optimizer dynamics to scaling behavior. This approach could fundamentally change how researchers select optimization strategies for large models, representing a substantial innovation in the field of ML optimization."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible but faces some implementation challenges. The systematic experiments across model sizes, optimizers, and hyperparameters would require substantial computational resources, though this is mitigated by the focus on using smaller models as proxies. The theoretical model development linking optimizer dynamics to scaling behavior is ambitious and may encounter difficulties in establishing clean mathematical relationships given the complexity of modern optimizers and neural architectures. The proposed 50%+ reduction in hyperparameter search costs is a bold claim that would need rigorous validation. However, the overall approach is methodical and builds upon existing knowledge of optimization and scaling laws, making it reasonably achievable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in modern machine learning with potentially far-reaching impact. As models continue to grow in size, understanding optimization-centric scaling laws could lead to substantial improvements in training efficiency, reducing both financial costs and environmental impact of AI development. The potential 50%+ reduction in hyperparameter search costs would be transformative for large-scale model training. The research directly contributes to the emerging field of scaling laws, which the task description identifies as warranting 'necessary discussion.' The open-sourced scaling predictors and practical guidelines would benefit both academic researchers and industry practitioners working with large models. The work could fundamentally change how optimization strategies are selected for different model scales."
