        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. The proposal directly addresses the focus of OPT 2024 on 'Scaling up optimization' by exploring how optimal hyperparameters vary with model capacity. It specifically tackles the question mentioned in the task description about 'natural model size dependent learning rates that allow extrapolation from smaller models to large ones.' The idea also addresses the environmental impact concerns mentioned in the task description by proposing a method that could reduce compute resources for hyperparameter tuning by over 80%. The proposal fits perfectly within the listed topics including 'Scaling laws', 'Deep learning optimization', and 'Adaptive Stochastic Methods'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation is well-articulated, explaining the problem of expensive hyperparameter search for large models. The main idea clearly outlines the proposed approach: training small-to-medium models, fitting scaling functions, and using these to predict hyperparameters for larger models. The methodology is described in sufficient detail, mentioning specific techniques (Bayesian regression, neural surrogates) and validation approaches. The expected outcomes are quantified (within 2% of exhaustive search performance, 80% compute reduction). The only minor ambiguity is in the specific capacity metrics that would be most predictive and how the scaling functions would be designed for different hyperparameters, which would benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its systematic approach to hyperparameter extrapolation based on model capacity. While the concept of scaling laws in deep learning is not new (e.g., OpenAI and others have published on how loss scales with compute, parameters, and data), the specific application to hyperparameter scheduling and the proposed methodology of fitting smooth scaling functions to predict optimal hyperparameters appears to be a fresh contribution. The idea combines existing concepts (hyperparameter optimization, scaling laws, Bayesian regression) in a novel way, but doesn't introduce fundamentally new optimization algorithms or theoretical frameworks. The approach of transferring knowledge from small to large models has been explored in other contexts, but the systematic mapping of capacity to hyperparameters represents a valuable innovation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Training small-to-medium sized models and conducting hyperparameter sweeps is standard practice and well within reach of academic research labs. The statistical methods mentioned (Bayesian regression, neural surrogates) are established techniques with available implementations. The validation approach on transformer models from 10M to 1B parameters is ambitious but achievable with moderate computational resources. The main challenge would be ensuring that the scaling functions generalize well across different architectures and tasks, but the proposal acknowledges this by mentioning validation across different optimizers and architectures. The 80% reduction in compute claim is bold but not unreasonable given the approach. The methodology is clearly implementable with existing tools and frameworks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in modern machine learning: the prohibitive cost of hyperparameter tuning for large models. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions. Economically, it could save millions in training costs as mentioned in the task description. Environmentally, it directly addresses the growing concern about AI's carbon footprint by potentially reducing energy consumption for training large models. Scientifically, it contributes to our understanding of scaling laws in deep learning optimization. The approach is particularly timely given the rapid increase in model sizes and could become an essential tool for efficient development of large language models and other large neural networks. If successful, this work could influence how the entire field approaches hyperparameter tuning for large-scale models."
