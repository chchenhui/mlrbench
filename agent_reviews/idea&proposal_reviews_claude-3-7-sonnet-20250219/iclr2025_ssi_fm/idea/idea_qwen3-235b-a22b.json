    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description of scaling self-improving foundation models without human supervision. It directly addresses the core challenge of training on self-generated synthetic data while avoiding model collapse, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The proposed uncertainty-aware framework tackles the verification-generation gap highlighted in the task, and incorporates mechanisms to prevent drift and error feedback loops. The idea also connects to safety considerations mentioned in the task description by focusing on reliable training and calibration. The only minor point preventing a perfect score is that while the idea mentions applications to safety-critical systems, it could have more explicitly addressed some specific applications mentioned in the task (e.g., software agents, robotic self-improvement)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-structured approach with three distinct components: (1) ensemble verifier training, (2) uncertainty-based sample prioritization, and (3) dynamic recalibration. The motivation is clearly stated, and the expected outcomes are well-defined. The technical approach is described with sufficient detail to understand the core mechanisms. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific metrics for measuring verifier disagreement, the exact mechanism for downweighting ambiguous samples, and more concrete details on how the trusted data buffer would be maintained and updated over time. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. The integration of uncertainty estimation via ensemble disagreement with dynamic calibration for self-improvement is innovative. The approach of using verifier disagreement as an uncertainty signal for synthetic data quality assessment is a creative solution to the model collapse problem. However, many of the individual components (ensemble methods, uncertainty estimation, sample weighting, calibration with trusted data) are established techniques in machine learning. The novelty lies more in their specific combination and application to the self-improvement problem rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic approaches. The idea builds upon existing work rather than representing a completely groundbreaking departure."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Ensemble methods are well-established, and the techniques for uncertainty estimation and sample weighting are implementable with existing frameworks. The requirement for a small buffer of trusted data is reasonable and practical. The dynamic recalibration process builds on established calibration techniques. Implementation would require careful engineering but doesn't demand breakthrough technologies or unrealistic computational resources. The main challenge would be in fine-tuning the balance between trusting the ensemble verifiers and preventing drift, which might require empirical optimization. The approach is modular, allowing for incremental implementation and testing, further enhancing its feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI development: enabling foundation models to safely improve without human supervision. The significance is high because model collapse during self-improvement is a major obstacle to scaling AI systems beyond human-curated data, which the task description identifies as a looming bottleneck. If successful, this approach could enable more reliable autonomous learning, reducing dependence on finite human-labeled data while maintaining quality. The impact extends to safety-critical applications by providing mechanisms to detect and mitigate error propagation. The approach could significantly advance the field's understanding of verification-generation gaps and establish principles for safe self-improvement, directly addressing multiple core goals outlined in the workshop description. The potential for broad impact across different foundation model types further enhances its significance."
