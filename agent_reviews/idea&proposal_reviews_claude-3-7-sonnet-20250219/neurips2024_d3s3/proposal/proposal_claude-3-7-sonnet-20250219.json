        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on differentiable simulations, neural surrogates, and probabilistic inverse problems. The proposed Conditional Neural Operator framework combines Fourier Neural Operators with conditional normalizing flows to enable fast, differentiable, and uncertainty-aware inverse modeling for turbulent flows, which aligns perfectly with the research idea. The proposal builds upon recent literature cited in the review, specifically referencing the work by Du et al. (2024) on conditional neural field latent diffusion models, Wang et al. (2024) on FNO-based turbulent flow prediction, Oommen et al. (2024) on spectral representation improvements, and Haitsiukevich et al. (2024) on diffusion models as probabilistic neural operators. The proposal addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, including high-dimensional inverse problems, uncertainty quantification, and the simulation-to-real gap."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally very clear and well-structured. It provides a comprehensive introduction that establishes the context and significance of the research, followed by a detailed methodology section that explains the mathematical formulation, algorithmic implementation, data generation process, and experimental design. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly articulated. The mathematical notation is consistent and well-defined, making the technical aspects accessible. However, there are a few areas where additional clarity would be beneficial. For instance, the explanation of the spectral consistency loss could be more detailed, and the connection between the normalizing flow and the FNO could be more explicitly described in terms of how they interact during training and inference. Additionally, some of the mathematical formulations, particularly in the uncertainty quantification section, could benefit from more concrete examples to illustrate their practical implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of neural operators with conditional normalizing flows for probabilistic inverse modeling in turbulent flows. While both neural operators (specifically FNOs) and normalizing flows exist separately in the literature, their combination in an end-to-end trainable framework for inverse problems in turbulent flows represents a significant innovation. The approach of jointly learning both the forward PDE solution map and an approximate posterior over input parameters is particularly novel. The proposal also introduces innovative elements such as the multi-resolution approach with adaptive frequency filters to address spectral bias, and the explicit decomposition of uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components using deep ensembles. The integration of these components into a unified framework that enables real-time posterior sampling, gradient-based optimization, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification goes beyond incremental improvements to existing methods. However, the proposal builds heavily on existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms, which slightly limits its novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent technical soundness and rigor. The mathematical formulation is comprehensive and well-grounded in established theories of neural operators, normalizing flows, and variational inference. The Fourier Neural Operator formulation correctly builds on the work of Li et al. and incorporates appropriate modifications to address known limitations. The conditional normalizing flow implementation using neural spline flows is technically sound and well-justified. The training approach via amortized variational inference is appropriate for the problem at hand, and the objective function includes relevant terms for both posterior modeling and forward prediction accuracy. The uncertainty quantification methodology distinguishes between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in a principled manner using deep ensembles and information-theoretic measures. The data generation process is carefully designed to create realistic turbulent flow simulations, and the experimental design includes comprehensive evaluation metrics that cover accuracy, uncertainty calibration, computational efficiency, and practical applications. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and challenges, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the problem domain."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach, but with some implementation challenges. The individual components (FNO, normalizing flows, variational inference) have been demonstrated in the literature, suggesting their implementation is feasible. The data generation process using direct numerical simulation of Navier-Stokes equations is well-established, though computationally intensive. The proposed 10,000 simulation runs with varying parameters will require significant computational resources, but is achievable with modern high-performance computing facilities. The end-to-end training of the combined model may present optimization challenges, particularly in balancing the different loss components and ensuring stable convergence. The deep ensemble approach for uncertainty quantification, while theoretically sound, adds considerable computational overhead during both training and inference. The proposal does not fully address potential scalability issues when applying the method to very high-dimensional flow fields or extremely complex geometries. Additionally, the sim-to-real transfer experiments will depend on the availability of suitable experimental data, which may be limited. Overall, while the approach is implementable with current technology and methods, it will require considerable expertise, computational resources, and careful engineering to realize successfully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in computational fluid dynamics and has the potential for substantial impact across multiple domains. Fast, accurate, and uncertainty-aware inverse modeling of turbulent flows would represent a major advancement over current methods that are computationally prohibitive and often lack robust uncertainty quantification. The expected 100-1000Ã— speed-up compared to traditional methods could transform how inverse problems are approached in fluid dynamics, enabling new applications in real-time control and interactive design. The comprehensive uncertainty quantification framework would provide valuable information for decision-making in high-stakes scenarios. The differentiable nature of the approach enables gradient-based optimization for inverse design problems, opening new possibilities in aerodynamic shape optimization, flow control system design, and microfluidic device optimization. Beyond fluid mechanics, the core methodological contributions have potential applications in materials science, medical imaging, geophysics, and robotics. The proposal clearly articulates pathways to technological translation, including an open-source software library and integration with existing CFD tools. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's alignment with current trends toward machine learning-accelerated scientific computing and uncertainty-aware modeling."
