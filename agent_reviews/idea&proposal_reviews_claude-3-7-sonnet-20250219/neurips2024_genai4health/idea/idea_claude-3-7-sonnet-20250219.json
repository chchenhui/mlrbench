        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The TrustMed idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description, particularly with Topic 3 (Policy and compliance). It directly addresses the core challenge identified in the workshop: the trust deficit in healthcare GenAI due to compliance uncertainties. The framework's focus on translating policies into technical requirements, continuous compliance verification, and transparent reporting matches the workshop's goal of coordinating policymakers, GenAI developers, and security experts. The idea also touches on Topic 2 (Trustworthiness and risks) by proposing safeguarding techniques through compliance verification. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address some aspects of Topic 1 regarding specific use cases, though it does mention validation through clinical decision support and patient communication domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The TrustMed idea is presented with strong clarity. The three-component structure (policy-to-technical translator, compliance verification system, and report generator) provides a well-defined framework that is easy to understand. The motivation clearly establishes the problem being addressed, and the main idea articulates a concrete solution approach. The validation plan through specific healthcare domains adds further clarity. However, some technical details could be more precisely defined - for example, how exactly the policy-to-technical requirements translator would work with complex, sometimes ambiguous healthcare regulations, or what specific metrics would be used in the verification system. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The TrustMed idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to healthcare GenAI. Its primary innovation lies in treating policy compliance as an integrated design element rather than an afterthought, which represents a meaningful shift in approach. The policy-to-technical requirements translator appears to be a novel contribution that could advance the field. However, compliance verification systems and reporting mechanisms have been explored in other AI governance contexts, though perhaps not specifically for healthcare GenAI with this particular integrated approach. The idea combines existing concepts (compliance verification, transparency reporting) with novel elements (policy translation, healthcare-specific integration) in a fresh way, but doesn't represent a completely revolutionary approach to the problem."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The TrustMed idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. Translating complex healthcare policies (like HIPAA or FDA guidelines) into precise technical specifications is inherently difficult due to the often ambiguous nature of regulatory language. Continuous compliance verification would require sophisticated monitoring systems that can interpret model behavior in relation to these specifications - a non-trivial technical challenge. The framework would also need to adapt to evolving regulations and policies. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they would require significant expertise in both healthcare policy and AI development, along with substantial resources for implementation and validation. The case study approach for validation is practical, but scaling to cover the breadth of healthcare applications would be challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The TrustMed idea addresses a critical barrier to GenAI adoption in healthcare: the trust deficit stemming from compliance uncertainties. If successful, this framework could significantly accelerate responsible deployment of GenAI in healthcare settings by providing verifiable assurance to stakeholders about regulatory compliance. The potential impact extends beyond individual applications to establishing broader standards for trustworthy AI governance in healthcare. The significance is particularly high because healthcare is both highly regulated and potentially transformative as an AI application domain. By bridging technical innovation with regulatory requirements, TrustMed could enable substantial benefits in patient care, clinical decision support, and healthcare efficiency while mitigating risks of non-compliant AI deployment."
