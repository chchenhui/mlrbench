    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on GenAI trustworthiness in healthcare, policy compliance, and risk mitigation. The four-module framework (Synthetic Data Generator, Multi-Modal Evaluator, Clinician Feedback Loop, and Explainability & Compliance Analyzer) comprehensively addresses all three topic areas mentioned in the task description. The proposal builds upon the literature review by incorporating Bt-GAN's bias-transforming mechanisms, discGAN's multi-modal capabilities, and HiSGT's hierarchical semantic graphs. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes privacy concerns, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed privacy-preserving techniques in its methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The four-module architecture is logically presented with detailed explanations of each component. Mathematical formulations are provided for key metrics and algorithms, enhancing precision. The experimental design section clearly outlines datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics in a tabular format for easy comprehension. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the synthetic data generator and the multi-modal evaluator could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical terms (e.g., Bradley-Terry model) are introduced without sufficient context, and (3) the case study on diabetic retinopathy diagnosis could be more thoroughly integrated throughout the proposal rather than appearing only at the end."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in its approach to dynamic benchmarking for GenAI in healthcare. The integration of four interconnected modules creates a comprehensive framework that goes beyond static benchmarks. Particularly innovative aspects include: (1) the real-time clinician feedback loop that adapts evaluation criteria through online learning, (2) the policy compliance index that quantifies regulatory adherence, and (3) the multi-modal consistency evaluation across text, imaging, and genomics. However, many individual components build directly on existing techniques (Bt-GAN, HiSGT, CLIP, SHAP) rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms. The primary innovation lies in the integration and application of these techniques within a healthcare-specific benchmarking context, rather than in developing entirely new methodological approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-defined methodologies and metrics. The mathematical formulations for bias-transforming mechanisms, cross-modal alignment, and compliance scoring are technically correct and appropriate for the tasks. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive, covering clinical fidelity, fairness, multi-modal consistency, explainability, and compliance. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets (MIMIC-III, CheXpert, TCGA) and baselines. The ablation studies will help isolate the contribution of different components. The framework is grounded in established literature (Bt-GAN, HiSGT) and extends these approaches in meaningful ways. However, there are some areas that could benefit from more rigorous treatment: (1) the proposal could more explicitly address potential statistical limitations in synthetic data generation, (2) the faithfulness score formula needs more context on how the interpretable approximation g(x) is derived, and (3) more details on how policy constraints are mathematically embedded during training would strengthen the technical foundations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined modules and implementation strategies. The use of existing datasets (MIMIC-III, CheXpert, TCGA) and established tools (PyTorch, Scikit-learn, AI Fairness 360) increases practicality. The modular architecture allows for incremental development and testing. However, several challenges may impact feasibility: (1) obtaining sufficient clinician participation for the feedback loop may be resource-intensive and difficult to scale, (2) creating synthetic data that accurately represents rare diseases while maintaining privacy compliance is technically challenging, (3) the integration of multiple modalities (text, imaging, genomics) requires significant computational resources and expertise across domains, and (4) the policy compliance component depends on up-to-date regulatory knowledge that may vary across jurisdictions. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present significant implementation hurdles that would require careful planning and potentially extended timelines."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in healthcare AI evaluation with potentially high impact. By developing a dynamic benchmarking framework that adapts to evolving clinical scenarios and regulatory requirements, it directly tackles a major barrier to GenAI adoption in healthcare. The significance spans multiple dimensions: (1) Technical significance through establishing new standards for evaluating GenAI trustworthiness beyond static benchmarks, (2) Clinical significance by reducing diagnostic errors and bias in AI-driven healthcare applications, (3) Regulatory significance by streamlining compliance audits with automated reporting tools, and (4) Ethical significance by promoting equitable healthcare through fair representation in synthetic data. The diabetic retinopathy case study demonstrates practical application in a high-impact clinical domain. The open-source deliverables ensure broad accessibility and potential for widespread adoption, further enhancing the proposal's significance. The alignment with current policy concerns and the integration of stakeholder feedback makes this work particularly timely and relevant."
