    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea of Adaptive Precision Scaling for Energy-Efficient Large Model Training aligns extremely well with the WANT workshop's focus on computational efficiency, scalability, and resource optimization. It directly addresses the workshop's call for energy-efficient training and efficient computations (specifically mentioned as 'low-precision computations'). The proposal tackles the challenge of growing model scale and training costs, which is central to the workshop's motivation. The idea specifically targets optimizing training processes to enable more accessible AI research, which is a core goal of the workshop. The only minor limitation in alignment is that while the proposal focuses heavily on energy efficiency, it could more explicitly address some other aspects of the workshop like parallelism or communication optimization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly defines the problem (energy consumption in large model training), proposes a specific solution (adaptive precision scaling based on real-time monitoring), and outlines the expected outcomes (reduced energy with minimal accuracy impact). The framework components are well articulated - monitoring gradient statistics, layer sensitivity, and hardware power draw to inform precision adjustments. The proposal is concise yet comprehensive in explaining the approach. However, it could benefit from slightly more detail on how the controller would specifically make decisions about precision levels, what metrics would trigger changes, and how the system would balance the trade-offs between energy savings and maintaining model accuracy during training."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by proposing a dynamic, adaptive approach to precision scaling during training, which goes beyond the current standard practices of static precision training. While mixed precision training exists, the real-time adaptation based on both model behavior (gradient statistics, layer sensitivity) and hardware state (power draw) represents a fresh perspective. The integration of these multiple signals to guide precision decisions is innovative. However, the core components (low-precision training, monitoring gradients, etc.) build upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. The novelty lies in the integration and dynamic adaptation rather than in creating entirely new training paradigms. Similar approaches have been explored in related domains, though perhaps not with this specific combination of inputs and objectives."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears quite feasible with current technology and methods. The components required (gradient monitoring, hardware power monitoring, precision switching) all exist individually in current ML frameworks and hardware. Modern GPUs and TPUs support multiple precision formats, and frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow have mechanisms for precision control. The challenge lies in integrating these components effectively and designing a controller that can make good decisions about when to change precision. The proposal mentions both rule-based and RL-based controllers, providing flexibility in implementation approaches. Some practical challenges might include: accurately estimating layer sensitivity without significant overhead, ensuring numerical stability during precision transitions, and developing effective heuristics for the controller. These challenges are substantial but appear surmountable with careful engineering and experimentation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a highly significant problem in modern AI: the enormous energy consumption and associated costs of training large neural networks. As models continue to grow in size (as highlighted in the workshop description), energy efficiency becomes increasingly critical for both environmental sustainability and democratizing AI research. The potential impact is substantial - if successful, this approach could significantly reduce the energy and cost barriers to training large models, making cutting-edge AI research more accessible to smaller teams and institutions with limited resources. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of enabling progress in AI for good and science applications. The significance extends beyond academic interest to practical real-world benefits in terms of reduced carbon footprint and operational costs for AI training. The approach is also generalizable across different model architectures and training scenarios."
