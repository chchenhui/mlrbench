        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on associative memories and their applications to multimodal architectures. The proposed Cross-Modal Harmonic Networks (CMHNs) extend modern Hopfield networks to operate across multiple modality spaces, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest in the workshop description. The proposal builds upon the cited literature, particularly CLOOB (FÃ¼rst et al. 2021), Kim et al.'s audio-visual bridging (2022), and Hopfield-Fenchel-Young Networks (Santos et al. 2024), while addressing the identified gaps in multimodal harmonization. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed approach extends associative memory principles to multimodal settings, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of developing 'novel architectures uniquely suitable for Associative Memory networks.'"

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The introduction effectively establishes the background, challenges, objectives, and significance. The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations of the energy function, attractor dynamics, and training procedure, making the technical approach transparent. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear datasets, baselines, tasks, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the harmonic term in the energy function and the attractor dynamics could be more explicitly connected; (2) The transition between the continuous-time gradient descent flow and the discrete Hopfield-style update using softmax attention could be explained more thoroughly; (3) Some of the mathematical notation, particularly in the training procedure section, could be more precisely defined. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is well-articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to multimodal learning through associative memory networks. The key innovation lies in the unified energy-based formulation that creates cross-modal attractors in a shared energy landscape. While individual components build upon existing work (modern Hopfield networks, multimodal contrastive learning), the integration of these elements into a coherent framework with cross-modal coupling terms represents a significant advancement. The proposal explicitly addresses gaps identified in the literature review, particularly the lack of a unified energy function for intra- and inter-modal attractors and the challenge of spurious attractors in cross-modal coupling. The harmonic alignment term in the energy function is an innovative contribution that distinguishes this work from prior approaches. The proposal does share some conceptual similarities with cited works like Kim et al. (2022) and Lee & Kim (2024), but extends these ideas substantially by formalizing a tri-modal framework with a principled energy-based approach."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations from associative memory theory and energy-based models. The mathematical formulation of the energy function and update dynamics is rigorous and follows from established principles in Hopfield networks and gradient-based optimization. The training procedure combines contrastive learning with energy regularization in a principled manner. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) The convergence properties of the proposed update rule in the multimodal setting are asserted but not proven; (2) The choice of cross-modal coupling term (quadratic difference) is intuitive but lacks theoretical analysis of its optimality; (3) The interaction between the softmax-based modern Hopfield update and the cross-modal projections could potentially lead to instabilities that aren't fully addressed. While these concerns don't invalidate the approach, they represent areas where the theoretical soundness could be strengthened."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and experimental design. The implementation builds on established techniques (modern Hopfield networks, contrastive learning) and uses standard datasets (COCO, Flickr SoundNet). The computational requirements, while substantial, appear manageable with current GPU resources. The authors propose a PyTorch implementation with GPU acceleration, which is appropriate for the task. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The scalability of the approach to large-scale multimodal datasets might be challenging, particularly with the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms; (2) Training three separate encoders along with cross-modal coupling matrices introduces a large number of parameters, which could lead to overfitting or training instabilities; (3) The proposed ablation studies and statistical analysis are comprehensive but may require significant computational resources to execute fully. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent practical hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in multimodal AI: creating systems that can naturally associate related features across different sensory domains. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of bridging theoretical associative memory work with mainstream machine learning applications. The significance is high for several reasons: (1) It provides a principled framework for multimodal associative memory that could influence how researchers approach cross-modal learning problems; (2) The expected performance gains in cross-modal retrieval and completion tasks would represent meaningful advances in multimodal AI capabilities; (3) The theoretical insights into multimodal attractor landscapes could inform both machine learning and computational neuroscience; (4) The practical applications outlined (text-to-image generation, multimodal dialog agents, assistive technologies) have clear societal benefits; (5) The proposal explicitly aims to bridge communities (associative memory theorists, energy-based modelers, multimodal ML practitioners), which aligns with the workshop's stated goal. The potential impact extends beyond the specific model to influence how researchers conceptualize multimodal learning more broadly."
