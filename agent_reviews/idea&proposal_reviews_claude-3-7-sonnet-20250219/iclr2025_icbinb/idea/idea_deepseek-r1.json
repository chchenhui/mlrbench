        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the ICBINB workshop's focus on challenges in applied deep learning. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of exploring 'challenges, unexpected outcomes, and common principles underlying similar issues and failure modes encountered across various fields.' The proposed taxonomy specifically targets cross-domain failure modes, which matches the workshop's emphasis on finding 'common reasons or patterns in challenges and failure modes across disciplines.' The idea also incorporates the workshop's categorization of issues (data-related, model limitations, deployment challenges) into its hierarchical taxonomy structure. The only minor gap is that while the workshop emphasizes negative results and failed experiments, the proposal focuses more on categorizing failures rather than presenting specific negative results, though it does plan to analyze case studies from workshop submissions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure and purpose. It precisely defines the approach (developing a hierarchical taxonomy through qualitative coding and clustering), the categorization framework (root cause, manifestation, domain-specific context), and expected outcomes (failure database, cross-domain guidelines, identification of understudied failure modes). The examples provided (label noise in medical imaging vs. sensor drift in autonomous vehicles) effectively illustrate the concept. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific methodology for qualitative coding, the validation process with domain experts, and how the taxonomy will be maintained and updated over time. The proposal could also more explicitly define the scope of 'deep learning failures' to be included in the taxonomy."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by proposing a unified, cross-domain taxonomy of deep learning failures - something explicitly noted as missing in the field ('no systematic framework exists'). While taxonomies exist within specific domains, the cross-cutting approach that enables translation of mitigation strategies across fields represents a fresh perspective. The proposal innovatively combines qualitative research methods with machine learning expertise to create a structured understanding of failures. The concept of mapping similar root causes across different domain manifestations is particularly novel. However, the basic approach of taxonomizing failures is not entirely new, as classification systems exist in software engineering and other fields, though their application to deep learning deployment specifically is innovative."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with existing methodologies and resources. Qualitative coding and clustering are established research methods, and the ICBINB workshop submissions provide a ready source of case studies. The iterative validation with domain experts is a practical approach to refining the taxonomy. However, there are implementation challenges that merit consideration. Creating a truly comprehensive cross-domain taxonomy requires extensive expertise across multiple fields, which may be difficult to coordinate. The validation process with domain experts could be time-consuming and complex. Additionally, maintaining a public failure database raises questions about standardization, quality control, and long-term sustainability. The proposal would benefit from more details on how these challenges will be addressed, but overall, the core idea is implementable with appropriate resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in the field of applied deep learning. As AI systems become increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, understanding failure modes systematically across domains has enormous potential impact. The proposed taxonomy could significantly advance the field by: (1) enabling practitioners to anticipate and mitigate risks before deployment, (2) facilitating knowledge transfer of solutions across domains that wouldn't otherwise interact, (3) highlighting understudied failure modes that require research attention, and (4) providing a common language for discussing DL failures across disciplines. The public database and cross-domain guidelines represent concrete, practical contributions that could directly influence how DL systems are developed and deployed in real-world settings. This work directly addresses the workshop's goal of understanding why deep learning doesn't always deliver as expected in real-world applications."
