    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the ICBINB workshop's focus on challenges in applied deep learning by systematically investigating failures in healthcare applications. The proposal incorporates all key elements requested in the task: it presents a clear use case (healthcare DL applications), references solutions proposed in literature, describes negative outcomes, and investigates why these systems fail. The multi-dimensional taxonomy approach directly responds to the literature review's identified challenges including underspecification, deployment workflow issues, adversarial vulnerabilities, data distribution shifts, and clinical workflow integration. The methodology comprehensively covers the collection of real-world failure cases across multiple healthcare domains, which perfectly aligns with the workshop's goal of creating a platform for sharing challenges across domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated with specific research objectives, a detailed methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-phase research design provides a logical progression from data collection to framework development. The technical aspects are explained with appropriate mathematical formulations for metrics like Distribution Shift Index, Calibration Error, and Fairness Gap. The timeline and deliverables section offers a clear roadmap for implementation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact criteria for selecting and recruiting healthcare providers and AI vendors for case studies could be more specific, (2) the relationship between the qualitative case studies and the quantitative metrics could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., FGSM in adversarial training) are used without explanation, which might be unclear to non-specialists."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its comprehensive approach to systematically categorizing and addressing DL failures in healthcare. While individual components like distribution shift analysis or fairness metrics are not new, the integration of these elements into a unified taxonomy and decision-support framework represents a novel contribution. The multi-dimensional approach combining qualitative case studies with quantitative metrics and the development of a practical tool for risk assessment is innovative. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing concepts in the literature rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. The metrics proposed (DSI, ECE, fairness gap) are established in the literature, and the clustering approach for failure modes is a standard technique. The novelty lies more in the application domain and the systematic framework rather than in methodological innovation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for metrics are correctly presented, and the research design follows a logical progression. The three-phase approach provides a comprehensive methodology that addresses multiple dimensions of the problem. The proposal appropriately references relevant concepts from the literature review, such as underspecification and distribution shifts. The validation strategy using two new healthcare applications is well-designed to test the effectiveness of the framework. However, there are some areas where additional rigor could be beneficial: (1) the proposal could more explicitly address potential selection biases in the case study corpus, (2) the clustering methodology could benefit from more discussion of alternative approaches and sensitivity analysis, and (3) the validation phase could include more details on statistical power calculations to ensure meaningful results."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with a reasonable 18-month timeline. The phased approach allows for incremental progress and adjustment. The methods described are implementable with current technology and expertise. However, several practical challenges may affect implementation: (1) recruiting healthcare providers and AI vendors to share failure cases may be difficult due to reputational concerns and proprietary information; (2) obtaining sufficient high-quality data for the case study corpus (50+ cases) within the timeline may be challenging; (3) the controlled simulations to reproduce failure conditions may require significant computational resources; and (4) validating the framework on new applications within the proposed timeline is ambitious. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they represent significant hurdles that may require additional resources or timeline adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in healthcare AI research with potentially far-reaching implications. Understanding and mitigating DL failures in healthcare applications directly impacts patient safety, clinical outcomes, and resource allocation. The public corpus of failure cases and the decision-support tool would provide valuable resources for researchers, healthcare organizations, and regulatory bodies. The taxonomy of failure modes could guide more robust model development and evaluation practices. The broader impact extends beyond healthcare to other high-stakes domains where AI reliability is crucial. The proposal aligns perfectly with the ICBINB mission of elevating negative results to advance the field. The focus on preventing repeated mistakes and enhancing transparency in AI deployment addresses fundamental challenges in applied deep learning identified in the task description and literature review."
