        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the EDâ†’GAI thrust mentioned in the workshop description. It directly tackles the challenge of 'developing novel safeguarding techniques to validate the authenticity of content' which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest. The proposal recognizes both the challenges posed by generative AI in education (potential academic dishonesty) and aims to develop technical innovations to address these challenges. The hybrid approach combining content analysis with behavioral metadata is precisely the kind of novel safeguarding technique the workshop seeks to explore."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (unreliable detection of AI-generated content), proposes a specific solution (hybrid framework combining text analysis with behavioral metadata), and outlines the methodology in sufficient detail. The two-stream approach is well-defined, explaining both content analysis and behavioral metadata components. The implementation pathway via learning platform APIs is also specified. Minor ambiguities exist around the exact algorithms to be used for the multimodal model and how the behavioral data would be collected across different learning environments, but these are reasonable omissions for a research proposal at this stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its multimodal approach to authenticity verification. While text-based AI detection tools exist, the integration with behavioral metadata analysis (keystroke dynamics, edit histories, time-spent data) represents a fresh perspective. Most current approaches focus solely on linguistic patterns in the final text, whereas this proposal innovatively incorporates the process of creation as a verification signal. The correlation between writing process patterns and final text features is particularly innovative. The approach isn't entirely unprecedented (keystroke dynamics have been used in other security contexts), but its application to academic integrity verification in the context of generative AI represents a novel combination of existing technologies with new purpose."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. While text analysis components are readily implementable using existing LLM technologies, the behavioral metadata collection presents significant practical hurdles. Capturing keystroke dynamics and detailed edit histories would require specialized plugins or modifications to existing learning platforms, raising privacy concerns and implementation barriers. Creating a comprehensive dataset pairing authentic student work with behavioral logs would be time-consuming and might face IRB/ethical approval challenges. Additionally, students using AI tools outside the monitored environment could bypass the system. The integration with learning platforms via APIs is reasonable but would require cooperation from platform providers. These challenges don't make the idea impractical, but they do present substantial implementation hurdles that would require careful planning and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical and timely problem in education. As generative AI becomes increasingly sophisticated and accessible, the ability to verify the authenticity of student work is of paramount importance to maintaining academic integrity. Current solutions are inadequate, often producing false positives that unfairly penalize students or missing AI-generated content entirely. The proposed approach could significantly impact educational assessment practices by providing more reliable authenticity verification. Beyond just detecting AI use, the system could provide valuable insights into student writing processes and guide the ethical integration of AI tools in education. The potential to restore confidence in assessment systems while acknowledging the reality of AI tools makes this research highly significant for educators, institutions, and educational technology developers."
