        "justification": "The Affective GenAI Tutor idea aligns excellently with the GAIED workshop's focus on exploring generative AI for education. It directly addresses the GAI→ED thrust by proposing a framework that enhances educational technology through emotionally intelligent AI tutors. The idea also touches on the ED→GAI thrust by acknowledging and addressing challenges like privacy concerns and over-reliance on AI. The proposal specifically targets personalized learning experiences and human-machine collaborative systems, which are explicitly mentioned in the workshop description. The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively address safeguarding against biases or incorrect information, though it does mention ethical design considerations."

        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The three-step framework provides a concrete implementation path using specific technologies (multimodal transformers, LLMs) and explains how affective feedback will be integrated into the system. The validation approach through user studies is also well-defined. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific metrics for measuring 'perceived empathy' and more details on how the system will balance cognitive and affective adaptations. The technical implementation of feeding affective insights into LLM prompting/fine-tuning workflows could also be more precisely defined."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by integrating real-time multimodal affective feedback into generative AI tutors, which addresses a gap in current systems that primarily focus on cognitive aspects. While emotion recognition in educational technology isn't entirely new, the specific application to generative AI tutors and the multimodal approach (combining facial, vocal, and postural data) offers fresh perspectives. The integration of affective computing with LLMs for dynamic pedagogical adaptation represents an innovative combination of existing technologies. However, both affective computing and AI tutoring are established fields, so this represents more of an innovative combination and extension of existing approaches rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces several implementation challenges. The technical components (multimodal transformers, LLMs) exist, but integrating them into a real-time system that accurately detects and responds to affective states is complex. Emotion recognition from multimodal inputs remains challenging, especially in diverse educational settings with varying lighting, audio quality, and cultural expressions of emotion. The proposal would require significant computational resources for real-time processing of video, audio, and text. Privacy concerns and data collection protocols add another layer of complexity. User studies across K-12 and higher education would require substantial coordination with educational institutions. While achievable, the project would require considerable expertise, resources, and time to implement effectively."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea addresses an important gap in current AI tutoring systems by incorporating emotional intelligence, which is known to significantly impact learning outcomes. If successful, this research could substantially improve student engagement, satisfaction, and learning performance by creating more responsive and empathetic AI tutors. The work has broad applications across educational levels (K-12 and higher education) and potentially across subjects. It also sets important precedents for ethical affective AI design in educational contexts, which has implications beyond tutoring systems. The significance is enhanced by the growing adoption of AI in education and the need for systems that address both cognitive and affective dimensions of learning. However, the impact may be limited by adoption barriers such as technology access inequities and privacy concerns."
