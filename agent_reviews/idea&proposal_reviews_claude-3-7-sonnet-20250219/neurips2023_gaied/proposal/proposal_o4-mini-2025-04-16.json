    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GAIâ†’ED thrust by exploring how generative AI can enhance education through a Socratic learning partner. The methodology incorporates techniques mentioned in the literature review, such as prompt engineering from SPL and the Socratic teaching approach from SocratiQ. The proposal builds upon the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly addressing the need for authentic Socratic dialogue and evaluation of teaching effectiveness. The experimental design with comparison groups aligns with the evaluation approaches mentioned in EducationQ. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes emotional support as a challenge, the proposal only briefly mentions emotion modeling as future work rather than integrating it into the core methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with distinct sections that flow logically from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is detailed with specific steps, mathematical formulations, and evaluation metrics. The experimental design is thoroughly explained with sample sizes, conditions, and measurement instruments. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the multi-task learning framework and RLHF could be more explicitly connected, (2) the process for creating the reward model for RLHF could be more detailed, and (3) the personalization mechanism mentioned in section 3.4 could be elaborated further to explain how the system will track and utilize student profiles."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to generative AI for education. The combination of supervised fine-tuning with an auxiliary Socratic-move classification loss and RLHF specifically optimized for question quality represents a novel technical contribution. The focus on developing an AI system that prioritizes inquiry over answer-providing is a refreshing departure from conventional AI tutoring systems. However, the core concept of using LLMs for Socratic dialogue builds upon existing work like SocratiQ and SPL mentioned in the literature review. The annotation schema is explicitly adapted from these existing systems rather than being entirely new. While the proposal offers fresh perspectives and combinations of existing techniques, it is not fundamentally groundbreaking in its conceptual approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and methodological soundness. The mathematical formulations for the training objectives are clearly presented and theoretically sound, combining supervised fine-tuning with auxiliary classification and reinforcement learning. The experimental design includes appropriate control conditions, randomization, and multiple measurement instruments. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive, covering both process measures (question quality, reasoning depth) and outcome measures (learning gains, metacognitive awareness). The statistical analysis plan is appropriate for the design. The annotation process includes inter-annotator agreement measures to ensure reliability. However, there are some minor limitations: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential confounds in the experimental design, (2) the sample size justification through power analysis is missing, and (3) there could be more discussion of potential limitations of the RLHF approach in this specific educational context."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible research plan with realistic components. The use of publicly available LLMs (LLaMA-2 13B) as a starting point is practical, and the data collection target of 5,000 dialogues is ambitious but achievable. The annotation process with multiple annotators and inter-annotator agreement checks is standard practice. The experimental design with 120 participants is reasonable for an educational study. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) collecting and annotating 5,000 human-tutored Socratic dialogues may be time-consuming and resource-intensive, (2) implementing RLHF requires significant computational resources and expertise, (3) the proposal doesn't specify the timeline for completion, which could be challenging given the multiple stages involved, and (4) recruiting and retaining 120 undergraduate STEM students for three 45-minute sessions may present logistical challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in educational technology: how to leverage generative AI to foster critical thinking and metacognitive skills rather than simply providing answers. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on exploring how generative AI can enhance education while addressing challenges. The potential impact is substantial across multiple domains: (1) educational practice through scalable peer-like interactions, (2) generative AI research through new methods for aligning models with pedagogical objectives, and (3) policy and ethics by demonstrating how AI can cultivate higher-order thinking. The annotated dialogue dataset and evaluation benchmark would be valuable contributions to the research community. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on STEM domains rather than broader educational contexts, and the proposal could more explicitly address how the approach might reduce educational inequities or support diverse learners."

It effectively combines educational theory with advanced AI techniques to address a meaningful problem in AI-enhanced education. The methodology is well-developed, the evaluation plan is comprehensive, and the expected outcomes are clearly articulated. While there are some limitations in terms of novelty and feasibility, these do not significantly detract from the overall quality and promise of the research.",
