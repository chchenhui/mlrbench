    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GAIED workshop's two main thrusts: enhancing educational technology through AI (GAI→ED) by developing a Socratic learning partner, and addressing challenges in education (ED→GAI) through evaluation frameworks and bias mitigation. The proposal builds upon the literature review effectively, citing works like SocratiQ, SPL, and EducationQ while addressing their limitations. It maintains fidelity to the original idea of creating an LLM-based Socratic learning partner focused on inquiry rather than direct instruction. The methodology includes comprehensive data collection, model development, and experimental validation approaches that align with the workshop's goals of fostering a multilingual community of researchers, educators, and practitioners."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections for introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. Research objectives are explicitly stated and logically connected to the methodology. The technical approach is well-defined, including specific formulas for question prioritization and loss functions during fine-tuning. The experimental validation section provides detailed metrics and procedures for the user study. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific curriculum topics to be covered in the study could be more explicitly defined, (2) the connection between the quantitative metrics and the broader goal of fostering metacognitive skills could be more thoroughly explained, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the question prioritization module could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in its approach to developing an AI-based Socratic learning partner. While the concept of using AI for Socratic teaching is not entirely new (as evidenced by SocratiQ and SPL in the literature review), this proposal introduces several innovative elements: (1) the question prioritization module that scores candidate questions based on relevance, openness, and learning objectives, (2) the focus on collaborative inquiry rather than direct instruction, which differentiates it from conventional AI tutors, and (3) the comprehensive evaluation framework measuring metacognitive skill development. However, the core approach of fine-tuning LLMs on curated dialogues is relatively standard in the field, and some aspects of the methodology build incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in both AI and educational theory, with clear connections to the Socratic method and metacognitive skill development. The technical approach is robust, including appropriate model selection (Llama-3 or Mistral-7B), well-defined prompt engineering strategies, and a sound fine-tuning approach using Low-Rank Adaptation. The evaluation framework is comprehensive, with both quantitative and qualitative metrics that align with the research objectives. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, a reasonable sample size, and a clear procedure. The mathematical formulations for the question prioritization module and loss function are correctly presented. The proposal also acknowledges limitations in existing approaches and addresses them systematically. However, there could be more discussion of potential technical challenges and mitigation strategies, particularly regarding the generalizability of the approach across different educational domains."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The use of existing LLMs (Llama-3 or Mistral-7B) as base models is practical, and the fine-tuning approach using LoRA is computationally efficient. The data collection strategy leveraging existing tutoring transcripts and synthetic generation is reasonable. The experimental validation with 120 participants is ambitious but achievable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) curating high-quality Socratic dialogues at scale may be challenging and resource-intensive, (2) the development of an effective question prioritization module with appropriate weights for different factors requires significant tuning and validation, (3) the proposed user study with three 45-minute sessions per participant represents a substantial time investment, and (4) measuring metacognitive skill development reliably within the timeframe of the study may be difficult. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present notable implementation hurdles that would require careful planning and resource allocation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant gap in current AI educational tools by focusing on fostering metacognitive skills rather than simply providing answers. This aligns well with educational best practices and addresses a critical need in the field. The potential impact is substantial: (1) democratizing access to high-quality Socratic dialogue, particularly in under-resourced educational settings, (2) advancing our understanding of how AI can complement human pedagogy, (3) providing actionable insights for educators and AI researchers, and (4) contributing open-source tools to the community. The proposal explicitly connects to broader educational equity goals and AI safety considerations. The expected outcomes include both technical contributions and empirical insights that could influence the development of future educational AI systems. While the immediate impact might be limited to specific educational contexts and subject areas, the approach has the potential for broader application across various educational domains if successful."
