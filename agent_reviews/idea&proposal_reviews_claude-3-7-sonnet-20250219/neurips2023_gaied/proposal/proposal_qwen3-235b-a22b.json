    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GAIED workshop's dual thrusts by exploring how generative AI can enhance education (GAI→ED) through Socratic dialogue and addressing challenges in education by redirecting AI from answer provision to cognitive scaffolding (ED→GAI). The proposal builds upon the literature review by acknowledging existing systems like SocratiQ, SPL, and EduChat while identifying their limitations. It then proposes solutions that address these gaps, particularly in simulating authentic peer-like interactions, personalization, and evaluation frameworks. The research objectives are comprehensive and directly respond to the challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of data collection, model architecture, interaction design, and evaluation methods, including specific mathematical formulations for the fine-tuning process. The experimental design is thoroughly described with concrete metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more specific details on how the agent will adapt to individual students' reasoning patterns and cognitive preferences, and how the reward function components (Q_score, C_score, M_score) will be precisely calculated. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and follows a logical flow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to AI-enhanced education. While Socratic dialogue systems exist (as noted in the literature review), this proposal innovates by repositioning the AI as a collaborative peer rather than an authoritative tutor, which represents a significant shift in perspective. The integration of RLHF with a specialized reward function for Socratic dialogue quality is a fresh approach. The proposal also introduces novel evaluation metrics specifically designed for assessing Socratic interactions. However, the core technologies (LLaMA-3-8B, SFT, RLHF) are established methods, and some aspects of the approach build incrementally on existing systems like SocratiQ and SPL rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The novelty lies more in the application and combination of existing methods toward a specific educational goal rather than in developing entirely new AI methodologies."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The research is grounded in established educational theories around Socratic dialogue and collaborative learning. The technical approach is well-justified, with appropriate model selection (LLaMA-3-8B) and a comprehensive fine-tuning pipeline that includes both SFT and RLHF. The mathematical formulations for the loss function and reward function are correctly presented. The experimental design is robust, with appropriate control groups, sample sizes, and statistical analyses planned. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and align with the research objectives. The proposal also acknowledges the limitations of current approaches and provides a clear rationale for the proposed solutions. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions adapting to students' cognitive preferences, it doesn't fully elaborate on how these preferences will be detected or modeled, which could strengthen the technical soundness further."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible research plan with realistic components. The use of LLaMA-3-8B as the base model is practical, offering a good balance between capability and computational requirements. The data collection approach is reasonable, drawing from multiple sources including existing datasets and collaborations with educators. The experimental design with 200 participants is ambitious but achievable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional resources or refinement: (1) Creating high-quality annotated Socratic dialogues across multiple subjects could be time-intensive; (2) The RLHF component requires significant computational resources and expertise; (3) Developing a reliable reward function that accurately captures question quality, content accuracy, and metacognitive stimulation is complex; and (4) The user studies with 200 students across different grade levels will require substantial coordination. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that will require careful planning and resource allocation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in AI-enhanced education by focusing on fostering critical thinking and metacognitive skills rather than simply providing answers. This aligns perfectly with the GAIED workshop's emphasis on both opportunities and challenges in educational AI. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) Educational: It could transform how AI supports learning by emphasizing cognitive scaffolding over content delivery; (2) Technical: It contributes novel approaches to dialogue systems that prioritize pedagogical effectiveness; (3) Societal: It addresses equity concerns by making Socratic tutoring more accessible; and (4) Theoretical: It advances our understanding of how AI can support metacognitive development. The expected outcomes include both practical tools (prototype system, API) and theoretical contributions (evaluation framework, adaptability model). The proposal clearly articulates how these outcomes will benefit students, educators, and researchers. While the impact may initially be limited to educational contexts, the potential long-term significance for learning and AI development is considerable."
