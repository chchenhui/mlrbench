        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the AI for Science Workshop's focus on 'incorporating physical insights to AI methods' and 'accelerating drug discovery pipeline' by integrating physics-based validation into molecular generation. The proposal follows through on the core idea of physics-informed reinforcement learning for de novo molecular generation, implementing the MD surrogate model for rapid feedback and adaptive reward balancing as outlined in the research idea. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with clear connections to works like Mol-AIR (Park et al., 2024), Transformer-RL (Xu et al., 2023), and Graph-RL with physical constraints (arXiv:2312.04567), which are explicitly cited as baselines. The proposal addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly computational efficiency through surrogate models and accurate reward design through adaptive balancing."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and quantifiable (e.g., reducing per-molecule evaluation time by â‰¥90%, reducing costly MD cycles by 30-50%). The methodology section is particularly strong, with detailed mathematical formulations of the reward function, surrogate model architecture, and training procedures. The algorithm is presented step-by-step, making implementation straightforward. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for fine-tuning the surrogate model with new MD results could be more detailed, (2) the specific metrics for 'stability score' and 'binding-affinity proxy' could be more precisely defined, and (3) the relationship between the surrogate predictions and ground truth validation could be more explicitly described in the evaluation section."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining reinforcement learning for molecular generation with physics-based validation through a surrogate MD model. While individual components (RL for molecular generation, physics-informed neural networks) exist in the literature, their integration in this specific manner is innovative. The adaptive reward balancing mechanism that normalizes chemical and physical reward contributions is a fresh approach to a common challenge in multi-objective optimization. The proposal's novelty lies more in the novel combination and application of existing techniques rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms. The surrogate model approach is not entirely new (as evidenced by references to physics-informed neural networks in the literature review), but its specific application to accelerate MD simulations within an RL loop for drug discovery represents a valuable innovation. The proposal builds incrementally but meaningfully on existing approaches rather than presenting a revolutionary new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for the surrogate model, policy network, and reward functions are well-defined and technically correct. The RL framework is properly specified with clear state and action spaces, and the policy gradient approach is appropriate for the task. The training methodology, including the loss function for the surrogate model and the policy gradient updates, follows established practices in the field. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are well-conceived to isolate the contributions of different components. One minor concern is that while the proposal acknowledges the need to periodically fine-tune the surrogate model with new MD results, it doesn't fully address potential distribution shifts that might occur as the policy explores new regions of chemical space. Additionally, the proposal could benefit from more discussion of the theoretical guarantees or limitations of the surrogate model's ability to approximate complex MD simulations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation requirements. The computational resources specified (NVIDIA A100 GPUs, 64-core CPUs) are appropriate for the scale of the project. The use of established libraries (PyTorch Geometric, OpenMM, RDKit) reduces implementation complexity. The data requirements (50,000 molecules with MD simulations) are substantial but achievable given modern high-throughput computational resources. The proposal acknowledges the computational challenge of MD simulations and addresses it through the surrogate model approach. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) generating high-quality MD data for 50,000 molecules, even for short simulations, represents a significant computational investment; (2) the surrogate model's ability to accurately predict physical properties across diverse chemical spaces may be challenging to achieve in practice; (3) the adaptive reward balancing mechanism, while theoretically sound, may require careful tuning to prevent oscillations or reward collapse. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and methods, though it would require considerable computational resources and expertise in both ML and molecular dynamics."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current de novo drug design approaches: the disconnect between chemical validity and physical plausibility. By integrating physics-based validation into the generative process, the research could significantly reduce attrition rates in drug discovery pipelines, potentially saving substantial resources and accelerating the hit-to-lead stage. The expected outcomes are substantial and clearly articulated: 30-50% reduction in MD simulations needed per viable candidate, 25% increase in synthesizable molecules, and improved hit rates in binding assays. The approach is broadly applicable beyond drug discovery to other domains requiring both chemical creativity and physical rigor, such as materials design and protein-protein interfaces. The open-source release of code, models, and datasets would further amplify the impact by enabling community adoption. While not completely transformative of the field, this work represents a significant step forward in bridging AI-driven design with physical reality, addressing one of the most pressing challenges in computational drug discovery."
