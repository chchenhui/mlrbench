        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on scaling in AI for Science, particularly how scaling can help and be done in AI for Science, and how it changes the methodology-interpretability-discovery Pareto frontier. The three-stage pipeline (equivariant transformer foundation model, physics-informed adaptive scaling, and uncertainty-driven active sampling) is fully consistent with the original idea of symmetry-driven foundation model scaling. The proposal extensively references and builds upon the literature review, citing works on equivariant graph neural networks (arXiv:2206.11990, arXiv:2101.03164, arXiv:2204.05249), physics-informed scaling laws (arXiv:2302.23456), and uncertainty quantification (arXiv:2303.34567). The only minor inconsistency is that some papers mentioned in the literature review (like arXiv:2301.12345) aren't explicitly referenced in the proposal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a clear structure that outlines the problem, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-stage pipeline is logically presented with detailed explanations of each component: SE(3)-Eformer architecture, Dynamic Symmetry-Aware Scaling Laws (DiaSL), and active conformation refinement (ACRe). Technical concepts are explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, such as the tensor-product attention mechanism and the loss function for pretraining. The experimental design section clearly outlines benchmarking tasks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism of how the reinforcement learning controller selects optimal scaling steps could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between attention maps and hydrogen-bonding sites in the interpretability evaluation could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some technical terms (like CVs in Metadynamics) are used without full explanation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements. The SE(3)-Eformer architecture integrates Transformer-style attention mechanisms with strict E(3) symmetry preservation, extending beyond existing models like Equiformer. The Dynamic Symmetry-Aware Scaling Laws (DiaSL) represent a novel approach to resource allocation during training, adapting model capacity and dataset granularity based on validation metrics. The active conformation refinement (ACRe) algorithm introduces an innovative way to identify underrepresented motifs and generate targeted simulations. However, many of the individual components build incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The tensor-product attention mechanism, while well-adapted to the problem, shares similarities with previous equivariant architectures. The uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo dropout) are established techniques rather than novel developments. The proposal's strength lies in the synergistic integration of these components rather than in revolutionary new algorithms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The equivariant architecture correctly preserves the essential physical symmetries (translational, rotational, and permutational invariance) through well-formulated tensor product operations. The mathematical formulations for attention weights and loss functions are technically sound. The physics-informed scaling laws are well-motivated by the need to optimize compute resources and are formulated with clear criteria for triggering model or dataset expansion. The uncertainty quantification approach using Monte Carlo dropout is well-established in the literature. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (NequIP, Allegro, Equiformer) and comprehensive evaluation metrics covering accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. However, there are a few areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the exact formulation of how uncertainty estimates translate to conformational uncertainties could be more precisely defined, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the active learning loop could be more thoroughly addressed, and (3) the statistical significance of the expected 2× improvement in accuracy-per-FLOP could be more rigorously justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components, though with some implementation challenges. The SE(3)-Eformer architecture builds on established equivariant neural network principles, making its implementation feasible with current deep learning frameworks. The pretraining dataset of 10^8 molecular conformers is ambitious but achievable given modern computational resources. The physics-informed scaling laws and active learning components have clear implementation paths. The experimental design specifies concrete tasks, baselines, and evaluation metrics, with a reasonable compute budget (2,000 A100 GPU hours). However, several aspects present feasibility challenges: (1) training on 10^8 conformers will require significant computational resources and optimization expertise, (2) the dynamic scaling approach requires careful implementation to avoid instabilities during training, (3) the active learning loop with Metadynamics simulations adds complexity that may extend the project timeline, and (4) achieving the stated goal of recovering rare events like protein folding transitions within 10× fewer steps than traditional MD is ambitious and may require additional methodological innovations beyond what's described."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in computational chemistry and materials science. Accelerating molecular dynamics simulations while maintaining accuracy has tremendous potential impact across drug discovery, materials design, and fundamental biophysics. The expected outcomes—2× improvement in accuracy-per-FLOP, enhanced generalization to out-of-distribution molecules, and recovery of rare events with 10× fewer steps—would represent meaningful advances in the field. The proposal's approach to symmetry-aware scaling could establish a new paradigm for resource-efficient AI in scientific applications, extending beyond molecular dynamics to other domains like quantum chemistry and continuum mechanics. The commitment to open science through sharing models, code, and datasets further enhances the potential impact. The significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of some components and the focus on a specific application domain (molecular dynamics) rather than a broader range of scientific problems. However, the principles developed could generalize to other domains where physical symmetries play important roles."
