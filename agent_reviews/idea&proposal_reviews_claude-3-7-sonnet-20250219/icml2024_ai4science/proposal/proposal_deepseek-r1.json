    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Scaling in AI for Scientific Discovery' by proposing a symmetry-driven foundation model scaling approach for molecular dynamics. The three-stage pipeline (pretraining with equivariant transformers, physics-informed scaling laws, and active sampling) perfectly matches the original idea. The proposal incorporates all key references from the literature review, building upon works like Equiformer [1], NequIP [2], and Allegro [3], while addressing the challenges of computational efficiency, physical symmetries, data efficiency, and interpretability identified in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that some of the cited papers in the literature review (5-10) appear to be fictional, but the proposal effectively captures their described concepts."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the three-stage methodology is thoroughly explained with appropriate mathematical formulations. The equivariant attention mechanism is precisely defined with equations, and the physics-informed scaling strategy is clearly articulated. The experimental design section provides specific benchmarks, metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for determining when to scale the model versus the dataset could be more precisely defined, (2) the threshold τ for uncertainty quantification is mentioned but not specified, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the group-equivariant attention could be further elaborated for reproducibility."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating three distinct approaches (equivariant architectures, physics-informed scaling laws, and active learning) into a cohesive framework for molecular dynamics. The combination of group-equivariant attention with transformer architectures and the adaptive scaling strategy based on physics-informed laws represents a fresh perspective. The proposal extends beyond existing works like Equiformer [1] and NequIP [2] by introducing a systematic approach to scaling both model capacity and training data. However, each individual component (equivariant networks, scaling laws, active learning) builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The innovation lies in their integration and application to molecular dynamics rather than in developing entirely novel methodological approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The equivariant transformers are well-grounded in group theory, and the mathematical formulations for attention mechanisms and loss functions are correctly presented. The physics-informed scaling laws follow established power-law relationships between validation error and compute. The experimental design includes appropriate benchmarks, metrics, and statistical tests to validate the approach. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. The proposal also acknowledges limitations, such as the assumption of access to high-fidelity simulators. One minor weakness is that the exact form of uncertainty quantification via Monte Carlo dropout could be more rigorously justified, and the proposal could benefit from more detailed error analysis to ensure the robustness of the approach across different molecular systems."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The equivariant transformer architecture builds on established frameworks like Equiformer [1], and the active learning approach uses standard techniques like Monte Carlo dropout. The data collection strategy (10 million molecular conformations) is ambitious but achievable with current computational resources. However, there are several practical challenges: (1) the computational cost of DFT simulations for the initial dataset and active learning samples could be substantial, (2) implementing and optimizing the group-equivariant attention layers may require significant engineering effort, and (3) the adaptive scaling strategy might need careful tuning to avoid instabilities. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of computational requirements and potential bottlenecks, as well as strategies to mitigate them."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in computational chemistry and has the potential for significant impact. The expected 2× improvement in accuracy per FLOP would substantially advance the state-of-the-art in molecular dynamics simulations, enabling more accurate and efficient drug discovery and materials design. The framework's ability to balance accuracy, interpretability, and computational cost directly addresses the Pareto frontier question posed in the task description. The outcomes would benefit multiple scientific communities, from computational chemists to drug designers and materials scientists. The proposal also contributes to the broader AI-for-Science paradigm by demonstrating how domain-specific priors can enhance scaling efficiency. The 40% reduction in carbon footprint for large-scale MD is particularly significant given growing concerns about the environmental impact of AI. While the immediate impact is focused on molecular dynamics, the principles could potentially extend to other scientific domains."
