        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, which focuses on scaling in AI for scientific discovery. The proposed adaptive physics-informed scaling framework directly addresses how scaling can be done more efficiently in AI for Science (one of the key interested areas). It also explores how intelligent scaling changes the Pareto frontier of methodology by offering better performance with fewer parameters. The idea addresses limitations of current scaling approaches and proposes a cure through physics-informed selective parameter allocation, which matches another interested area in the task description. The only minor gap is that it could more explicitly discuss interpretability benefits, though it does mention enhanced interpretability as a benefit."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (indiscriminate scaling vs. intelligent scaling), proposes a specific solution (adaptive physics-informed scaling), and outlines three concrete innovations. The framework's core components are well-defined: identifying physical regime boundaries, selective parameter allocation, and hierarchical scaling. The preliminary results are quantified (5-10x reduction in parameters). The only minor ambiguities are in the implementation details - while the high-level approach is clear, the specific mechanisms for identifying physical regime boundaries and the exact nature of the hierarchical scaling could benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong novelty in how it approaches the scaling problem in scientific AI. While physics-informed neural networks exist, the adaptive scaling aspect that dynamically allocates complexity based on physical principles represents a fresh perspective. The concept of selectively growing model capacity only where physical complexity demands it differs significantly from conventional uniform scaling approaches. The hierarchical scaling that mirrors multi-scale physical systems is particularly innovative. It's not entirely unprecedented - some work exists on adaptive neural architectures and physics-informed ML - but the specific combination and application to scientific scaling challenges appears to be a novel contribution to the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible but with some implementation challenges. The preliminary results showing 5-10x parameter reduction in fluid dynamics simulations suggest practical viability. The approach builds on existing concepts in physics-informed neural networks and adaptive architectures, which provides a foundation for implementation. However, automatically identifying physical regime boundaries requiring higher capacity could be technically challenging and might require significant domain expertise for different scientific applications. The selective parameter allocation guided by scientific prior knowledge also implies the need for domain-specific customization, which could limit generalizability across scientific domains. These challenges are substantial but likely surmountable with appropriate expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge at the intersection of AI and scientific discovery. The significance is high because efficient scaling of AI models for scientific applications could dramatically accelerate progress across multiple scientific domains while reducing computational costs and environmental impact. The 5-10x reduction in parameters while maintaining accuracy represents a substantial efficiency gain. By aligning model architecture with physical reality, the approach could also enhance scientific interpretability - a crucial factor for adoption in scientific communities. The potential impact extends beyond just performance improvements to enabling new scientific applications that were previously computationally infeasible, making this a highly significant contribution to the field of AI for Science."
