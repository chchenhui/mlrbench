    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on generative AI in finance, time-series modeling, and responsible AI integration. The proposal comprehensively incorporates the core concept from the research idea of combining diffusion models with knowledge graphs to generate synthetic financial time-series data that adheres to real-world constraints. The methodology section thoroughly addresses the technical approach outlined in the idea, including the use of GNNs to encode domain knowledge. The literature review is well-integrated throughout the proposal, with clear references to recent work on diffusion models for financial data (e.g., Takahashi & Mizuno 2024, FinDiff, TimeAutoDiff, TransFusion) and addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review such as capturing temporal dependencies and incorporating domain-specific constraints."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable to domain experts. The objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is broken down into well-defined components (data preprocessing, knowledge graph construction, diffusion model architecture, training objectives, sampling procedure, and evaluation). The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear metrics and baselines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for how the constraint loss is computed during training could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the knowledge graph and specific financial constraints could be illustrated with more concrete examples, and (3) some of the mathematical notation could be better explained for non-experts in diffusion models."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers significant novelty in its approach to financial time-series generation. While diffusion models have been applied to financial data (as seen in the literature review), the integration of knowledge graphs to guide the diffusion process represents a novel contribution. The proposal innovates by using GNNs to encode domain-specific constraints and regulatory rules directly into the generative process, which addresses a gap in existing approaches. The hybrid framework combining DDPMs with knowledge graphs is a fresh perspective that distinguishes this work from prior research. The constraint loss function that enforces regulatory compliance is another innovative aspect. However, some individual components (diffusion models for time series, GNNs for financial data) have been explored separately in the literature, which slightly reduces the novelty score from perfect. Nevertheless, their combination and specific application to financial regulatory compliance represents a substantial innovation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and soundness in its approach. The mathematical formulations for the diffusion process, GNN architecture, and training objectives are well-defined and theoretically grounded. The methodology builds upon established techniques (DDPMs, GNNs) with appropriate modifications for the financial domain. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and well-chosen to assess both statistical fidelity and constraint adherence. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and implementation details that would enable reproducibility. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and addresses them through its design choices. The integration of domain knowledge through the knowledge graph is well-justified and technically sound. The training and sampling procedures follow established practices in diffusion modeling with appropriate adaptations for the specific task. Overall, the technical foundations are robust and the methodology is rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with some implementation challenges. The core components (diffusion models, GNNs) are well-established with available implementations, and the hardware requirements (NVIDIA A100 GPUs) are reasonable for modern research. The data sources mentioned (S&P 500 minute-level data, Kaggle Credit Card Fraud) are publicly available, which supports feasibility. However, several aspects introduce complexity: (1) constructing a comprehensive financial knowledge graph with accurate regulatory rules and causal relationships requires significant domain expertise and may be challenging to validate, (2) the integration of the GNN with the diffusion model through FiLM layers adds architectural complexity, (3) balancing the constraint loss with the reconstruction loss may require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and (4) the computational requirements for training diffusion models with 1,000 steps on long time series could be substantial. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do increase the implementation difficulty and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need in financial AI: generating high-quality, privacy-preserving synthetic data that respects regulatory constraints. The significance is substantial across multiple dimensions. For research, it would democratize access to financial datasets that are typically restricted due to privacy concerns, potentially accelerating innovation in the field. For industry, it offers a pathway to develop and test AI models without exposing sensitive customer data, addressing a major compliance challenge. The focus on regulatory adherence is particularly significant given the highly regulated nature of financial services. The potential applications span fraud detection, risk modeling, and algorithmic tradingâ€”all areas of high economic impact. The proposal also contributes to responsible AI by embedding domain knowledge explicitly, promoting transparency and accountability. The expected outcomes include both methodological advances (better synthetic data generation) and practical benefits (improved downstream task performance), further enhancing its significance. The alignment with the workshop's focus on responsible AI integration in finance is particularly strong."
