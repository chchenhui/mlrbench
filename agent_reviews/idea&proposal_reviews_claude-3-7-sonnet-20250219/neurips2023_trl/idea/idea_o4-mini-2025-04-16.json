        "justification": "The Tri-View Contrastive Pretraining idea aligns excellently with the TRL workshop's focus on representation learning for structured data. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of advancing table representation learning by proposing a novel multi-view approach that handles tables in different formats. The idea specifically targets topics mentioned in the call, including representation learning for structured data, multimodal learning (combining text, graph, and SQL views), and applications for tasks like text-to-SQL and QA. The proposal's focus on cross-format transfer and unified embeddings also addresses the workshop's interest in handling heterogeneous tabular data."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The three views (text, graph, SQL) are well-defined and distinct, and the pretraining objectives (contrastive alignment and masked cell modeling) are clearly articulated. The motivation establishes the problem context effectively, and the expected outcomes are specific. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how the three encoders would be integrated during fine-tuning, and how exactly the synthetic SQL queries would be generated. These details would need elaboration in a full paper, but for a research idea summary, the clarity is very good."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality in its tri-view approach to table representation. While multi-view learning and contrastive pretraining are established techniques, their application to create a unified embedding space across three different table representations (text, graph, and SQL) appears innovative. The inclusion of a SQL view alongside the more common text and graph views is particularly novel. However, the core techniques (contrastive learning, masked modeling) are adaptations of established methods rather than fundamentally new approaches. The novelty lies more in the combination and application to the table domain rather than in inventing entirely new methodological frameworks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The individual components (text encoders, GNNs, seq-to-seq models) are well-established, and contrastive learning frameworks exist. The data collection aspect is ambitious but achievable given the availability of web tables and relational databases. The main implementation challenges would be in: (1) efficiently generating the three views at scale, (2) creating meaningful synthetic SQL queries that capture table semantics, and (3) balancing the three different learning objectives during training. These challenges are substantial but surmountable with careful engineering and experimentation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant problem in table representation learning - the fragmentation of approaches across different table formats. Creating a unified embedding space that works across text, graph, and SQL representations could substantially advance the field by enabling better cross-format transfer learning and reducing the need for format-specific models. The potential applications span multiple important areas (text-to-SQL, QA, classification) that are central to the TRL workshop's focus. If successful, this approach could become a foundation for more adaptable table understanding systems that work across the heterogeneous landscape of real-world tabular data, representing a meaningful contribution to the field."
