        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns very well with the task description. It focuses on table representation learning with multimodal aspects (table-text alignment), which is explicitly mentioned as a core topic in the workshop description. The proposal addresses representation learning for structured data (tables) and multimodal learning combining tables with text, which are two primary topics listed in the workshop scope. The idea of schema-aware pre-training directly contributes to the workshop's goal of advancing table representation learning and has clear applications in semantic parsing and question answering, which are highlighted as important application areas in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (understanding tables requires interpreting cell values, schema, and associated text), the proposed approach (multimodal pre-training with structure-aware encoders), and specific pre-training objectives (Schema-Text Alignment, Cell-Text Grounding, and Table-Text Matching). The expected outcomes are also well-defined. The only minor ambiguity is in the technical details of how exactly the structure-aware encoders will be implemented, as it mentions multiple possibilities (graph neural networks or specialized transformers) without committing to a specific architecture."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to table representation learning. The focus on explicitly modeling the relationship between table structure, content, and related text is a fresh perspective compared to methods that simply flatten tables. The three proposed pre-training objectives are innovative, particularly the Schema-Text Alignment and Cell-Text Grounding tasks. However, the core components (multimodal pre-training, structure-aware encoders) build upon existing techniques in the field rather than introducing fundamentally new architectures or paradigms. The novelty lies more in the combination and application of these techniques specifically for table-text alignment with schema awareness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. The proposed approach leverages established techniques (transformers, graph neural networks) that have proven effective in related domains. The pre-training objectives are well-defined and implementable. Large-scale table-text corpora exist (e.g., Wikipedia tables, scientific papers with tables) that could be used for pre-training. The main implementation challenges would likely be in designing effective structure-aware encoders for the schema and cell grid, and in scaling the pre-training to large datasets, but these challenges are surmountable with current computational resources and expertise in the field."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses an important problem in table representation learning. Improved table-text alignment has significant potential impact across multiple applications mentioned in the workshop description, including semantic parsing, question answering, and table understanding. The explicit modeling of schema information could lead to substantial improvements in these tasks, as schema understanding is often a bottleneck in table comprehension. The significance is enhanced by the broad applicability of the approach across domains where tables are prevalent (e.g., enterprise data, scientific literature, financial reports). The research directly contributes to advancing representation learning for structured data, which is a primary goal of the workshop."
