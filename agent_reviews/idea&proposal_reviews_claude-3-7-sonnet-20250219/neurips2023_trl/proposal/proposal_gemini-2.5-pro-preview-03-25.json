    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the TRL workshop's goals by focusing on tables as a primary modality for representation learning, advancing techniques through the novel dual-stream architecture, and targeting key applications like text-to-SQL and table QA. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like TableFormer, TURL, TAPAS, and TaBERT while addressing the identified challenge of integrating structural semantics. The dual-stream approach explicitly implements the content and structure streams mentioned in the research idea, along with the proposed pretraining tasks. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal could have more explicitly connected to some of the domain-specific challenges mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research gap, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The dual-stream architecture is explained in detail with formal notations and clear descriptions of both streams and their interaction mechanisms. The pretraining tasks are well-defined with specific objectives and loss functions. Implementation details and evaluation plans are comprehensive. The only areas that could benefit from further clarification are: (1) some technical details about how the cross-attention mechanism works across the two streams could be more precisely formulated, (2) the exact representation of relational constraints in the structure stream could be more detailed, and (3) the proposal could more clearly specify how the model would handle tables with missing structural metadata."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty through its dual-stream architecture that explicitly models and integrates structural metadata alongside content. While existing works like TableFormer incorporate structural biases and TURL captures some structural information, SADST's approach of using a dedicated structure stream with graph-based encoding of schema relationships is novel. The three pretraining tasks (especially Schema Relation Prediction and Cross-Stream Alignment) are innovative in how they explicitly target structure-content integration. The proposal builds upon existing transformer architectures and GNNs but combines them in a new way specifically designed for tabular data. The novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that dual-stream architectures exist in other domains, and some components (like masked cell recovery) are adaptations of existing techniques, but the overall integration and application to tabular data represents a fresh approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in established methods and literature. The architecture builds on proven transformer and GNN foundations, and the pretraining tasks are logically designed to address the research objectives. The evaluation methodology using standard benchmarks and ablation studies is appropriate. However, there are some areas where technical rigor could be improved: (1) the mathematical formulation of the cross-attention mechanism could be more precise, (2) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in extracting structural metadata from diverse table sources, (3) there's limited discussion of computational complexity and efficiency considerations for the dual-stream approach, and (4) the proposal could benefit from more detailed analysis of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach. While the overall approach is theoretically sound, these gaps slightly reduce the score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and existing technologies. The implementation leverages established libraries (PyTorch, Hugging Face, PyTorch Geometric) and builds on existing transformer architectures. The data sources for pretraining and evaluation are well-identified and accessible. However, several practical challenges affect feasibility: (1) the computational resources required for pretraining such a complex dual-stream model would be substantial, (2) extracting accurate structural metadata (especially relational constraints) from diverse table sources could be difficult and error-prone, (3) the integration of GNNs with transformers adds implementation complexity, and (4) the timeline for completing such an ambitious project (pretraining, fine-tuning, evaluation, ablation studies) might be challenging. While these issues don't make the project infeasible, they do present significant practical hurdles that would need careful management."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in table representation learning with potentially high impact. By explicitly modeling structural information, SADST could significantly improve performance on structure-sensitive tasks like text-to-SQL and complex table QA, which have direct applications in data accessibility and analysis. The approach aligns perfectly with the TRL workshop's goals of advancing table representation learning and showcasing impactful applications. If successful, this work could influence future research directions in tabular data modeling and bridge the gap between NLP and database communities. The potential practical applications are numerous and valuable, including natural language interfaces to databases, automated data preparation, fact verification systems, and conversational AI for structured data. The proposal also contributes methodologically by demonstrating how to effectively integrate structural knowledge into deep learning models for tables."
