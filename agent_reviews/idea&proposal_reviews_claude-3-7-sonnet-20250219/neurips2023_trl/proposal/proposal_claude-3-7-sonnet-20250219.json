    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on table representation learning, particularly the need for better handling of structured data. The dual-stream architecture specifically tackles the challenge mentioned in the idea about LLMs struggling with complex table structures. The proposal incorporates elements from the literature review, building upon works like TableFormer, TURL, and TaBERT while addressing their limitations in handling structural semantics. The methodology section thoroughly explains how the content and structure streams work together, which is consistent with the core concept in the research idea. The pretraining objectives and evaluation methods are well-aligned with the workshop's scope, particularly in addressing applications like text-to-SQL and table question answering."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally very clear and well-structured. The introduction effectively establishes the problem and motivation. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the model architecture, including mathematical formulations for both the content and structure streams, as well as their interaction mechanisms. The pretraining objectives are clearly defined with appropriate loss functions. The experimental design outlines specific tasks, metrics, and baselines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for handling very large tables is not fully specified, (2) some technical details about the implementation of the graph attention network could be more precise, and (3) the explanation of how the model handles tables with missing or implicit structure could be more detailed. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. The dual-stream architecture that explicitly separates content and structure processing is an innovative approach not fully explored in existing work. While models like TableFormer and TURL incorporate some structural information, they don't employ dedicated streams with cross-attention mechanisms. The structure stream's use of a graph attention network to model schema relationships is particularly novel, as is the cross-stream alignment objective that forces the model to learn correspondences between content and structure. The SQL-Schema alignment pretraining task is also innovative. However, some individual components build upon existing techniques (like masked language modeling and graph attention networks) rather than introducing entirely new methods. The proposal synthesizes and extends ideas from the literature in a novel way rather than presenting a completely unprecedented approach, which is why it scores highly but not maximally on novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. The mathematical formulations for both streams are well-defined and theoretically grounded. The content stream builds on established transformer architectures with appropriate modifications for tabular data. The structure stream employs graph attention networks, which are well-suited for modeling relational data like table schemas. The cross-stream interaction mechanisms are clearly specified with proper attention formulations. The pretraining objectives are mathematically sound and align with the goals of the model. The experimental design includes appropriate evaluation metrics and baseline comparisons. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. The data collection strategy is comprehensive, covering diverse table types. The training procedure is detailed with specific hyperparameters. Overall, the technical foundations are robust and well-justified, with only minor areas that could benefit from additional theoretical analysis, such as the convergence properties of the dual-stream training."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally feasible but presents some implementation challenges. The dual-stream architecture with cross-attention is computationally intensive, potentially requiring significant GPU resources for training. The data collection and preprocessing of diverse table structures, especially extracting structural metadata like primary-foreign key relationships, could be labor-intensive. The graph attention network for the structure stream adds complexity to the implementation. However, the proposal mitigates these concerns by providing detailed implementation specifications (e.g., batch size, optimizer, learning rate) and a phased curriculum learning approach. The evaluation on established benchmarks like Spider and WikiTableQuestions is practical. The distributed training across 8 GPUs is realistic for a research lab setting. While ambitious, the approach doesn't require any technologies or resources that are unavailable, making it challenging but achievable with appropriate resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in representation learning for tabular data, which is highly significant given the prevalence of tables in real-world data systems. If successful, the structure-aware approach could substantially improve performance on important tasks like text-to-SQL generation, table question answering, and schema matching, with potential impacts across multiple domains including business intelligence, scientific research, and healthcare analytics. The expected 5-8% improvement on benchmarks like Spider would represent a meaningful advance in the field. Beyond the technical contributions, the proposal has broader implications for human-data interaction, automated data preparation, and multimodal reasoning systems. The explicit modeling of table structure as a first-class citizen in representation learning could influence approaches in related domains like knowledge graphs and code repositories. The significance is particularly high given the workshop's focus on advancing table representation learning as a primary modality for AI systems."
