    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the TRL workshop's goal of advancing table representation learning by proposing a novel dual-stream architecture that explicitly models both content and structure. The proposal builds upon existing work mentioned in the literature review (e.g., TableFormer's structural invariance, TURL's table understanding, TaBERT's joint text-table modeling) while addressing identified limitations. The research objectives clearly target the workshop's focus areas, particularly representation learning for structured data and multimodal learning. The methodology section thoroughly details how the proposed approach addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as complex table structures and heterogeneous schemas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable. The dual-stream architecture is explained thoroughly with specific attention mechanisms and loss functions. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for integrating the two streams during inference could be more explicitly defined, (2) The preprocessing steps for schema metadata extraction could include more details on how foreign key relationships are automatically detected, and (3) The hyperparameter tuning process for the loss coefficients (λ1, λ2, λ3) could be more thoroughly explained. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The Structure-Aware Dual-Stream (SAD) pretraining approach offers significant novelty in several aspects. The explicit separation of content and structural metadata into distinct encoding streams represents a fresh perspective compared to existing approaches like TableFormer and TaBERT, which primarily focus on integrating structural information into a single stream. The introduction of cross-stream alignment pretraining tasks and the use of Graph Attention Networks for schema graph encoding are innovative contributions. While some individual components build upon existing work (e.g., masked language modeling from BERT-based approaches, graph neural networks), their combination and application to tabular data representation learning is novel. The proposal doesn't completely reinvent tabular representation learning but offers a substantial advancement by treating structure as a first-class component rather than an afterthought."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. The dual-stream architecture is well-justified based on the limitations of existing approaches, and the mathematical formulations for the model components and pretraining tasks are technically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, downstream tasks, and ablation studies to validate the approach. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The justification for the specific graph attention mechanism could be more thoroughly connected to the properties of table schemas, (2) The proposal could benefit from more detailed analysis of potential failure modes in the cross-stream attention mechanism, and (3) While the pretraining tasks are well-defined, the proposal could provide more theoretical justification for why these specific tasks would lead to better structural understanding. Overall, the approach is methodologically sound but has some areas where the theoretical foundations could be further developed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The model size (125M parameters) is comparable to BERT-base, making it trainable with standard research computing resources. The data collection strategy leverages existing datasets and synthetic generation, which is practical. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-established in the field. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The extraction of accurate schema metadata, particularly for web tables with inconsistent formats, may be more challenging than presented, (2) The computational requirements for dual-stream training might be substantial, as acknowledged in the limitations section, and (3) The creation of 18 million structured tables with high-quality schema annotations is ambitious and may require significant preprocessing effort. Despite these challenges, the overall approach appears implementable with current technology and methods, though it may require moderate refinement and optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current tabular representation learning approaches by explicitly modeling structural metadata, which has significant implications for downstream applications like text-to-SQL and table QA. The expected improvement of 15% in structural relation prediction and 5% in Spider benchmark execution accuracy would represent meaningful advances in the field. The broader impact section convincingly argues for the practical applications in industry (reducing barriers to data access), research (introducing schema graphs as a standard structural bias), and community benefits (fostering cross-pollination between NLP and ML). The proposal also thoughtfully addresses ethical considerations regarding data privacy. The significance is enhanced by the alignment with real-world needs for robust table understanding in enterprise settings where schemas evolve dynamically. While not completely transformative of the field, the approach has the potential to substantially advance tabular representation learning and influence future research directions."
