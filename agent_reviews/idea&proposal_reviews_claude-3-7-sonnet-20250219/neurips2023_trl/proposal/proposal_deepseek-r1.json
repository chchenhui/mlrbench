    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on table representation learning, particularly for complex structured data. The dual-stream architecture specifically targets the challenge of modeling both content and structure in tables, which is identified as a key limitation in the literature review. The proposal builds upon existing work like TAPAS, TaBERT, and TableFormer while addressing their limitations in handling complex table structures. The methodology, including pretraining tasks and evaluation benchmarks, is consistent with the research idea of creating a structure-aware model for robust tabular language models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The dual-stream architecture is clearly explained with specific details on how each stream processes different aspects of tabular data. The mathematical formulations for embeddings and loss functions are precise and well-defined. The pretraining tasks and experimental design are thoroughly described. However, there could be more clarity on how the cross-attention mechanism specifically works between the two streams, and some technical details about the schema graph construction could be more explicit. The figures referenced (e.g., Figure 1) are mentioned but not provided, which slightly reduces clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal introduces several novel elements, particularly the dual-stream architecture that explicitly separates content and structure processing. While previous works like TableFormer and TURL have addressed table structure, the explicit modeling of schema as a graph with hierarchical and relational dependencies is innovative. The cross-stream alignment through contrastive learning is also a fresh approach for tabular models. However, some components build directly on existing techniques (e.g., GAT for graph processing, masked language modeling for pretraining) rather than introducing entirely new methods. The approach is more of a thoughtful integration and extension of existing techniques rather than a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The dual-stream architecture is well-justified based on the limitations of existing approaches. The mathematical formulations for embeddings and loss functions are technically sound. The pretraining tasks are well-designed to capture both content and structural information. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, using established benchmarks and metrics. The implementation details are specific and realistic. However, there could be more discussion of potential limitations or failure modes of the approach, particularly regarding computational complexity of maintaining two separate streams and processing graph structures. The theoretical justification for why the dual-stream approach would outperform single-stream models with structural embeddings could also be strengthened."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible implementation plan with specific details on datasets, model architecture, and computational resources. The use of existing datasets (Spider, WikiTableQuestions, TABFACT) and base models (DeBERTa-v3) increases practicality. The hardware requirements (8x A100 GPUs) are substantial but reasonable for this type of research. However, there are some concerns about computational complexity, particularly for the graph attention network processing complex schema graphs, which might limit scalability to very large or complex tables. The pretraining on 1M tables would require significant computational resources and time. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of potential implementation challenges and mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in tabular representation learning that has significant implications for real-world applications. Improving how language models handle complex table structures would advance numerous applications including text-to-SQL, table QA, and data preparation. The expected improvements on benchmarks (+5% EM on Spider, +3% EM on WikiTableQuestions) would represent meaningful progress in the field. The broader impacts on enterprise applications, data democratization, and automated data preparation are well-articulated and compelling. The work could establish a foundation for future research in multimodal table reasoning. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on specific downstream tasks rather than a more general-purpose framework, but overall, the potential impact is substantial."
