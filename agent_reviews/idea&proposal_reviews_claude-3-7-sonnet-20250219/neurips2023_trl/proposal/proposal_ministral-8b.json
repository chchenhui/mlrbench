    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on representation learning for tabular data, particularly the challenges of complex table structures and heterogeneous schemas. The dual-stream architecture proposed matches the original idea precisely, with detailed elaboration on the content stream, structure stream, and cross-stream alignment. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, building upon work like TableFormer's structural biases, TURL's semantic and structural information capture, and addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review. The pretraining tasks (masked cell recovery, schema relation prediction, and cross-stream alignment) are consistent with the original idea and address gaps in existing approaches."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-articulated and structured logically, making it easy to follow. The introduction clearly establishes the background, objectives, and significance. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the model architecture, pretraining tasks, and experimental design, including mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly stated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the schema graph and the GCN could be more explicitly defined, (2) The cross-stream alignment mechanism could be explained in more detail, particularly how it facilitates joint learning, and (3) Some of the mathematical formulas, while correct, could benefit from additional context explaining how they integrate into the overall architecture."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a dual-stream transformer architecture that explicitly models both content and structure of tabular data. This approach addresses a significant gap in existing methods that primarily focus on content while neglecting structural semantics. The cross-stream alignment mechanism for matching SQL queries to schema subgraphs is particularly innovative. However, several components build upon existing techniques: the content stream resembles approaches in models like TAPAS and TaBERT, while the structure stream incorporates graph-based methods similar to those in other domains. The pretraining tasks, while well-designed for the specific architecture, are adaptations of common techniques in representation learning. The proposal offers a fresh combination of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates a strong theoretical foundation. The dual-stream architecture is well-justified based on the limitations of existing approaches, and the mathematical formulations for embeddings, graph convolutions, and cross-stream attention are correctly presented. The pretraining tasks are logically designed to encourage joint learning of content and structure. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets (Spider, WikiTableQuestions) and evaluation metrics, with comparison to relevant baseline models. The cross-validation approach enhances the reliability of the results. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) The proposal could provide more details on how the model handles different types of table structures (e.g., nested headers), (2) The integration of the content and structure streams could be more thoroughly justified with theoretical analysis, and (3) The proposal could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential limitations or failure cases."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The dual-stream architecture builds upon established transformer and graph neural network techniques, making it implementable with current deep learning frameworks. The datasets mentioned (Spider, WikiTableQuestions) are publicly available, and the evaluation metrics are standard in the field. However, several aspects may require significant computational resources and engineering effort: (1) Training a dual-stream model with cross-stream attention may be computationally expensive, (2) Constructing and learning schema graphs for diverse table structures could be complex, (3) The integration of GCNs with transformers may require careful optimization to ensure effective learning, and (4) The proposal doesn't fully address how the model would scale to very large tables or databases with complex schemas. These challenges are manageable but would require careful implementation and potentially significant computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in tabular representation learning with significant potential impact. By enhancing LLMs' ability to understand complex table structures, the research could substantially improve performance on critical tasks like text-to-SQL and data QA. The explicit modeling of table topology could lead to more robust and generalizable models for real-world applications involving heterogeneous schemas. The research aligns well with the workshop's goals of advancing table representation learning and fostering collaboration across NLP, ML, IR, and DB communities. The potential applications in enterprise, finance, medical, and legal domains highlight its broad relevance. The proposal could make meaningful contributions to the field by addressing a fundamental limitation in current approaches. However, while the impact would be significant, it may not be transformative to the entire field of AI or ML, which limits the score from being in the highest range."
