        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on Foundation Models in the Wild, particularly addressing the 'Reasoning and Planning' key problem area. The proposal directly tackles mathematical problem-solving, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as a target application. The hybrid approach combining FMs with symbolic solvers addresses the reliability concerns in real-world deployments, which is another core theme of the workshop. The idea also touches on practical applications in STEM domains, which aligns with the workshop's interest in applications across natural sciences."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement (FMs faltering on mathematical problems), a specific proposed solution (decomposing problems and invoking external symbolic solvers), and an expected outcome (improved accuracy and verifiable solutions). The methodology involving fine-tuning on annotated datasets with reasoning chains is well-defined. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as the specific mechanisms for integrating tool outputs back into the reasoning chain and how the system would handle cases where tool calls fail or return unexpected results."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea presents a fresh approach by combining foundation models with symbolic solvers in a structured way for mathematical reasoning. While tool augmentation for language models is not entirely new (e.g., LangChain, AutoGPT frameworks), the specific focus on mathematical problem-solving with annotated reasoning chains and structured tool calls represents a novel application. The approach of explicitly training models to generate intermediate reasoning steps and tool queries is innovative. However, it builds upon existing work in tool-augmented language models rather than introducing a completely new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research is highly feasible with current technology. Both foundation models and symbolic solvers like SymPy and WolframAlpha are well-established technologies. Creating datasets with annotated reasoning chains and tool calls is labor-intensive but achievable. Fine-tuning methodologies for such tasks are well-understood. The main implementation challenges would likely be in creating high-quality training data with appropriate tool calls and ensuring the model learns to make appropriate tool calls at the right moments. The integration between the FM and external tools is technically straightforward but may require careful engineering to handle edge cases."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical limitation of foundation models in mathematical reasoning, which has significant implications for STEM education, scientific research, and technical domains. Improving the reliability and verifiability of mathematical problem-solving would substantially enhance the practical utility of FMs in high-stakes applications. The hybrid approach could serve as a template for similar integrations in other domains requiring precise reasoning. The ability to produce verifiable step-by-step solutions is particularly valuable for educational applications and building trust in AI systems. This work could bridge the gap between neural and symbolic approaches to AI, which has been a long-standing challenge in the field."
