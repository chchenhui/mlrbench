        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The SafeRAG proposal aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on Foundation Models in the Wild. It directly addresses multiple key problems outlined in the task description: (1) In-the-wild Adaptation through retrieval-augmented generation for clinical applications, (2) Reliability and Responsibility by implementing uncertainty estimation to reduce hallucinations, and (3) Practical Limitations in Deployment by incorporating human-in-the-loop review when confidence is low. The proposal specifically targets healthcare applications, which is explicitly mentioned as a relevant domain in the workshop scope. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some aspects like multi-modal integration or agent-based interactions, but these aren't required for every submission."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The SafeRAG proposal is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The three-step process for handling uncertainty is precisely defined, making the workflow easy to understand. The technical components (Monte Carlo dropout, multi-hop retrieval, chain-of-thought templates) are specified with sufficient detail. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as how exactly the uncertainty thresholds would be learned, the specific metrics for measuring hallucination rates, and details on the evaluation methodology for clinical QA benchmarks. While these minor ambiguities exist, they don't significantly impede understanding of the core research idea."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal combines several existing techniques (RAG, uncertainty estimation, chain-of-thought prompting) in a novel way specifically for clinical applications. The integration of uncertainty-guided retrieval expansion and the adaptive fallback to human review represents a fresh approach to the critical problem of medical hallucinations. While individual components like RAG and uncertainty estimation are established methods, their combination with the three-tiered response strategy based on confidence levels is innovative. The proposal doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks, but rather presents a thoughtful recombination and application of existing methods to address an important domain-specific challenge."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The SafeRAG proposal is highly feasible with current technology and resources. All the core components—retrieval systems, foundation models, uncertainty estimation techniques like Monte Carlo dropout, and human-in-the-loop systems—are well-established and implementable. Medical knowledge bases like UMLS and PubMed are readily available. The main implementation challenges would likely involve: (1) calibrating uncertainty thresholds appropriately for clinical contexts, (2) ensuring the retrieval system can efficiently perform multi-hop queries across medical literature, and (3) designing an effective human review interface. These challenges are substantial but surmountable with existing methods and reasonable resources, making the overall approach quite practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is exceptionally high given the critical nature of healthcare applications and the dangerous consequences of hallucinations in clinical settings. By addressing model reliability in healthcare—where errors can directly impact patient safety—the proposal tackles one of the most pressing concerns in AI deployment. The approach could significantly advance responsible AI use in medicine by providing calibrated confidence scores and reducing hallucination rates. Beyond healthcare, the uncertainty-guided retrieval framework could generalize to other high-stakes domains requiring factual accuracy. The work directly contributes to building trust in foundation models for critical real-world applications, which is central to the workshop's focus on responsible deployment of FMs in the wild."
