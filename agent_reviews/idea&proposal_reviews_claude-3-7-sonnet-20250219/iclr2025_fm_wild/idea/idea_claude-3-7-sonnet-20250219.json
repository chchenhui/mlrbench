        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on Foundation Models in the Wild. It directly addresses the 'Reasoning and Planning' key problem by proposing a hierarchical memory architecture to enhance multi-step reasoning capabilities across modalities. The idea also touches on 'In-the-wild Adaptation' through its domain-specific knowledge store and 'Practical Limitations in Deployment' by addressing memory constraints. The proposed evaluation on multi-hop question answering, mathematical problem-solving with visual interpretation, and scientific reasoning tasks perfectly matches the workshop's scope of complex real-world challenges. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address the reliability and responsibility aspects mentioned in the workshop description, though the meta-cognitive layer that evaluates reasoning quality implicitly relates to reliability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (FMs struggling with complex reasoning across modalities), proposes a specific solution (hierarchical external memory architecture with three distinct layers), and outlines how the system would function (using a transformer-based controller). The three memory layers are well-defined with distinct purposes. The evaluation domains are also clearly specified. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how exactly the transformer-based controller interacts with the FM, the specific mechanisms for backtracking upon detecting logical inconsistencies, and how information flows between the three memory layers. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. While external memory architectures, retrieval-augmented generation, and reasoning traces have been explored separately in prior work, the hierarchical three-layer approach with a specific meta-cognitive component for error detection and backtracking represents an innovative combination. The multi-modal aspect of the memory system is particularly novel, as most existing approaches focus on single-modality reasoning. However, it builds upon rather than fundamentally reimagines existing memory augmentation techniques, and the transformer-based controller is a relatively standard approach. The meta-cognitive layer for reasoning quality evaluation is perhaps the most original component, but would benefit from more specificity about its implementation."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The individual components (external memory, retrieval mechanisms, transformer controllers) have established implementations in the literature. The factual knowledge store and reasoning trace memory can be implemented using existing vector database and retrieval technologies. However, there are moderate implementation challenges: (1) The meta-cognitive layer for evaluating reasoning quality and detecting errors is conceptually sound but technically complex to implement effectively; (2) Maintaining coherence across different modalities in the reasoning process requires sophisticated cross-modal representation techniques; (3) The computational resources required for the full system might be substantial, especially for real-time applications. These challenges are significant but likely surmountable with careful engineering and sufficient resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical limitation of current foundation models - their struggle with complex multi-step reasoning across modalities. If successful, this approach could significantly advance how FMs handle complex problems in healthcare, scientific discovery, and education, which are high-impact domains mentioned in both the idea and workshop description. The ability to decompose complex problems, maintain coherent reasoning across steps and modalities, and detect/correct errors would represent a meaningful advancement in FM capabilities. The multi-modal aspect is particularly significant as real-world problems rarely confine themselves to a single modality. The approach could also generalize beyond the specific evaluation domains mentioned. However, it's not entirely clear how transformative this would be compared to other approaches being developed for similar purposes, which prevents it from receiving the highest significance score."
