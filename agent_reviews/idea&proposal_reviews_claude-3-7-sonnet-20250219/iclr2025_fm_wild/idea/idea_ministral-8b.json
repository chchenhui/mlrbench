    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the 'In-the-wild Adaptation' key problem by proposing a framework that leverages RAG, ICL, and fine-tuning to adapt foundation models to specific domains like drug discovery, education, or clinical health - exactly as mentioned in the workshop's focus areas. The proposal also touches on reliability issues (reducing hallucinations) which connects to the 'Reliability and Responsibility' theme. The only minor gap is that while the proposal mentions improving reliability, it doesn't explicitly address all aspects of responsibility such as fairness, ethics, and privacy that are mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented in a clear, structured manner with well-defined components. The three-step methodology (Domain-Specific Knowledge Retrieval, Contextual Adaptation, and Fine-Tuning) provides a concrete framework for implementation. The expected outcomes are also clearly articulated. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, how exactly the retrieval system will be designed, what metrics will be used to evaluate 'improved adaptability,' and how the balance between the three adaptation techniques (RAG, ICL, and fine-tuning) will be managed. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing techniques (RAG, ICL, and fine-tuning) rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. While the integration of these approaches for multi-domain adaptation is valuable, each of these techniques has been extensively studied individually. The novelty lies in their systematic combination and application to the specific challenge of multi-domain adaptation. The proposal doesn't clearly articulate how this combination differs from existing approaches that might already combine some of these elements. A truly novel contribution would require more specificity about the unique aspects of the integration or new algorithmic improvements to any of these components."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible as it builds upon established techniques (RAG, ICL, and fine-tuning) that have demonstrated success individually. The necessary components for implementation exist, and the technical challenges are well-understood. The retrieval systems, contextual adaptation mechanisms, and fine-tuning approaches have mature implementations available. However, there are some practical challenges that might arise: (1) creating comprehensive domain-specific knowledge bases for multiple domains requires significant effort, (2) effectively combining the three adaptation techniques without them interfering with each other requires careful engineering, and (3) evaluating performance across multiple diverse domains will be resource-intensive. These challenges are surmountable but non-trivial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is substantial as it addresses a critical challenge in deploying foundation models in real-world scenarios. Improving domain adaptation capabilities would greatly enhance the practical utility of FMs across various fields including medicine, education, and finance - domains with high societal impact. The potential to reduce hallucinations and improve reliability directly addresses major concerns about FM deployment. The impact would be felt by both developers and end-users of these systems. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the innovation; while valuable, it builds on existing approaches rather than proposing a paradigm shift in how we approach domain adaptation."
