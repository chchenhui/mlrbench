        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's guiding theme of exploring 'to what extent ML models can comprehend mathematics and what applications could arise from this capability' by proposing a hybrid LLM-KG system for explainable mathematical reasoning. The proposal incorporates the key aspects from the original idea of integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for explainable reasoning, and expands it into a comprehensive research plan. It also thoroughly engages with the literature review, citing relevant works like Li et al. (2025), Luo et al. (2024), and Luo et al. (2023) on KG-LLM integration, while addressing the identified challenges of explainability, complex reasoning, and hallucination reduction. The proposal's focus on applications in education, scientific research, and financial modeling aligns perfectly with the workshop's interest in applications across various domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The EMG-LLM architecture is explained in detail, with clear descriptions of its components (LLM Core, Dynamic Mathematical Knowledge Graph, KG Interaction Module, and Explainability Interface) and their interactions. The algorithmic steps for problem-solving are presented systematically, making the workflow easy to follow. The evaluation metrics are well-defined, covering accuracy, explainability, robustness, and efficiency. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for validating mathematical steps could be more precisely defined, particularly how the system would handle complex symbolic manipulations; (2) the proposal could more explicitly define how the KG schema would be designed to accommodate different mathematical domains; and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the KG Interaction Module could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to mathematical reasoning with LLMs by introducing a dynamic knowledge graph that evolves during the problem-solving process. While the integration of KGs with LLMs has been explored in prior work (as cited in the literature review), the proposal innovates in several ways: (1) it focuses specifically on mathematical reasoning rather than general knowledge-based QA; (2) it emphasizes the dynamic construction of problem-specific KGs rather than static knowledge retrieval; (3) it introduces a validation mechanism that leverages the KG structure to verify reasoning steps; and (4) it provides a framework for generating explainable reasoning traces. However, the core idea of combining LLMs with KGs for improved reasoning is not entirely new, as evidenced by works like RoG and GCR mentioned in the literature review. The proposal builds upon these existing approaches rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The EMG-LLM architecture is well-grounded in both LLM and knowledge graph literature, with clear connections to existing work. The algorithmic steps for the reasoning process are logically sound, with appropriate validation mechanisms to ensure correctness. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including relevant baselines and metrics that address multiple dimensions of performance. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, showing awareness of technical hurdles. The mathematical formulation of the knowledge graph (nodes, edges, operations) is appropriate for representing mathematical reasoning steps. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the validation mechanism could benefit from more formal specification, particularly regarding how mathematical correctness is verified; (2) the proposal could more explicitly address how the system would handle ambiguity in natural language descriptions of mathematical steps; and (3) while the evaluation metrics are well-chosen, some (like faithfulness) might benefit from more precise operational definitions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that builds on existing technologies and methodologies. The core components—LLMs and knowledge graphs—are well-established, and the integration approach is conceptually clear. The datasets identified for evaluation are appropriate and publicly available. The evaluation metrics are measurable and relevant to the research objectives. However, several implementation challenges affect the feasibility score: (1) Developing a robust KG Interaction Module that can accurately parse natural language into graph operations for diverse mathematical domains is non-trivial; (2) The validation of mathematical steps may require sophisticated symbolic reasoning capabilities beyond simple graph checks; (3) The computational resources required for running state-of-the-art LLMs while simultaneously managing and updating knowledge graphs could be substantial; (4) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully detail how to handle cases where validation is 'Uncertain'; and (5) Human evaluation for explainability metrics will require careful experimental design and sufficient resources. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do increase its complexity and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI systems for mathematical reasoning: the lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This is a significant limitation that hinders the adoption of LLMs in high-stakes domains like education, scientific research, and financial modeling. By providing transparent, verifiable reasoning traces, the proposed EMG-LLM system has the potential to substantially improve trust in AI-driven mathematical problem-solving. The applications highlighted in the proposal—educational tools, scientific discovery, engineering—align perfectly with the workshop's focus areas and represent domains where explainable mathematical reasoning could have substantial real-world impact. The approach also contributes to the broader goal of developing AI systems capable of complex, reliable reasoning beyond pattern matching. The potential to reduce hallucinations and logical errors addresses a fundamental weakness in current LLMs. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's emphasis on open-source dissemination, which could accelerate progress in the field. The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect score is that the initial implementation might be limited to specific mathematical domains rather than covering the full breadth of mathematical reasoning."
