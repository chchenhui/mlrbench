    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the intersection of LLMs and mathematical reasoning, focusing on explainability through knowledge graph integration - precisely matching the core idea. The proposal incorporates relevant benchmarks mentioned in the literature review (U-MATH, MathBench, PutnamBench, Omni-MATH, FrontierMath) and builds upon techniques like Graph-constrained Reasoning (GCR) from Luo et al. (2024). The methodology specifically addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly explainability, multi-step reasoning, and hallucination reduction. The proposal's focus on educational applications and scientific discovery also aligns with the task's emphasis on applications in education and science."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with formal definitions, pseudocode, and mathematical formulations that make the implementation path understandable. The dynamic reasoning graph construction process is particularly well-defined, with explicit action types and a clear algorithmic pipeline. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for translating the reasoning graph into formal proof scripts is mentioned but not fully elaborated, (2) the relationship between the optional GNN embeddings and the main pipeline could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical details about the graph constraint implementation could be further specified. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing approaches in a novel way. The dynamic construction of problem-specific knowledge graphs that evolve during reasoning is innovative, extending beyond the static KG retrieval approaches like KG-GPT mentioned in the literature review. The graph-constrained decoding mechanism builds upon Luo et al.'s work but adapts it for mathematical reasoning specifically. The proposal's integration of graph update operations as explicit LLM outputs is also a fresh approach. However, the core components (KGs with LLMs, graph-constrained decoding) do exist in prior work, and the proposal is more of a novel synthesis and application rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The optional GNN embedding component is also relatively standard in graph-based approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established techniques from both knowledge graph processing and LLM prompting. The mathematical formulations for graph construction, constrained decoding, and GNN embeddings are technically correct and appropriately presented. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics that address both accuracy and explainability. The statistical analysis plan includes appropriate significance testing. The implementation details are realistic and specific. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions potential challenges in scaling the approach to very complex problems, it doesn't fully address how the system would handle cases where the knowledge graph becomes extremely large or when the reasoning requires concepts not present in the background KG. Overall, the technical approach is sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined implementation steps. The required components (LLMs, knowledge graph databases, GNN frameworks) are all existing technologies, and the computational requirements (8Ã— A100 GPUs) are substantial but reasonable for this type of research. The methodology builds on established techniques like graph-constrained decoding and knowledge graph retrieval, which increases its practicality. However, there are some implementation challenges that might require significant effort: (1) constructing a comprehensive background KG from diverse mathematical sources will be labor-intensive, (2) training the LLM to emit structured graph-update operations may require extensive fine-tuning data, and (3) ensuring the graph constraints don't overly restrict the model's reasoning flexibility could require careful balancing. While these challenges are manageable, they do represent non-trivial engineering and research efforts that could impact the timeline or scope of the project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI-driven mathematical reasoning: the lack of explainability and reliability in LLM-based approaches. This is particularly important for applications in education, scientific research, and formal verification, where understanding the reasoning process is as important as the final answer. The expected outcomes include substantial improvements in accuracy (10-20%), hallucination reduction (30-50%), and high explanation fidelity (>85%), which would represent meaningful advances in the field. The impact section convincingly argues for applications in educational technology, automated theorem proving, scientific discovery, and trustworthy AI - all areas of significant importance. The proposal's focus on bridging informal LLM reasoning with formal verification systems is especially valuable for the mathematical community. While the approach may not completely solve the explainability challenge for all mathematical domains, it represents a substantial step forward with clear practical benefits."
