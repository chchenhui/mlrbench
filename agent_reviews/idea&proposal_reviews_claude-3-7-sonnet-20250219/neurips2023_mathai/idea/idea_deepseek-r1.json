    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's theme of measuring mathematical reasoning in AI systems, which is explicitly mentioned as one of the key areas of interest. The proposal focuses on developing a benchmark that evaluates not just answer correctness but the reasoning process itself, which speaks to the task's question about 'to what extent can machine learning models comprehend mathematics.' The idea also touches on applications (education, science) and comparative aspects between human and machine reasoning, which are other focal points of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't extensively address all potential applications mentioned in the task description (like software verification or finance)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. It clearly articulates the motivation, main components of the benchmark, and expected outcomes. The four specific components of the benchmark (context-rich problems, dynamic difficulty tiers, distractor tasks, and cross-disciplinary prompts) are well-defined and logically organized. The purpose and methodology are straightforward to understand. However, some minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific metrics that will be used to evaluate step-by-step reasoning validity, and the exact implementation details of the 'dynamic difficulty tiers' could benefit from further elaboration. Overall, the idea is well-articulated with only minor points needing clarification."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to mathematical reasoning evaluation. While mathematical benchmarks exist (as acknowledged in the proposal with references to MATH and GSM8K), this proposal innovates by shifting focus from mere answer correctness to evaluating the reasoning process itself. The inclusion of distractor tasks to force logical justification and cross-disciplinary prompts to assess transfer learning are particularly novel elements. The holistic approach combining step validation with generalization testing is relatively fresh. However, some components build upon existing evaluation paradigms rather than introducing completely new methodologies, and the concept of step-by-step evaluation has been explored in some prior work, though not as comprehensively as proposed here."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears feasible with current technologies and methodologies. Creating mathematical problems with varying difficulty levels and cross-disciplinary contexts is achievable, especially with the proposed collaboration with human experts and educators. The evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark is straightforward given existing infrastructure. However, there are moderate challenges: (1) obtaining high-quality human annotations for step-by-step validity at scale could be resource-intensive; (2) designing distractor tasks that are genuinely challenging for advanced models requires careful crafting; and (3) ensuring consistent evaluation criteria across diverse mathematical domains may prove difficult. These challenges are surmountable but will require significant effort and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current AI evaluation methodologies for mathematical reasoning. By focusing on the reasoning process rather than just correctness, it could significantly advance our understanding of whether AI systems truly comprehend mathematics or merely pattern-match. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's central question. The potential impact extends to multiple domains mentioned in the task description: education (through alignment with pedagogical principles), scientific applications (via context-rich problems), and the advancement of AI capabilities in mathematics. The benchmark could become a standard tool for evaluating and improving mathematical reasoning in AI systems, potentially influencing the development of more trustworthy and genuinely intelligent systems. The focus on generalization and transfer learning also addresses fundamental questions about AI capabilities."
