    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on world models, particularly the themes of 'Understanding World Rules' through causal mechanisms and 'World Model Training and Evaluation' by proposing a novel training objective. The proposal builds upon the core idea of enhancing world models with counterfactual reasoning capabilities through latent state prediction, exactly as outlined in the research idea. It thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works on causal mechanisms, counterfactual learning, and world models. The methodology section clearly explains how the proposed Causality-Aware World Models (CAWMs) will be implemented, trained, and evaluated, consistent with both the task requirements and research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research problem, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, with precise mathematical formulations of the model components and loss functions. The training procedure and experimental design are thoroughly described, making the implementation path clear. The only minor issues preventing a perfect score are: (1) some sections could be more concise without losing content, and (2) the counterfactual data generation process could benefit from more explicit discussion of potential challenges in obtaining ground-truth counterfactuals in complex environments. Overall, the proposal is highly readable and understandable, with logical flow between sections and well-defined technical components."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to integrating causal reasoning into world models through counterfactual latent state prediction. While the individual components (world models, counterfactual reasoning) exist in prior work, their combination in this specific way represents a fresh perspective. The innovation lies in the explicit training objective for counterfactual prediction and the architectural designs proposed for intervention integration. However, the approach builds heavily on existing world model architectures (e.g., DreamerV3) and causal inference concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms. The proposal acknowledges similar works in the literature review (e.g., papers 5-10) but doesn't clearly articulate how it advances beyond these specific works, which somewhat limits its perceived novelty. Nevertheless, the specific implementation details and evaluation framework offer meaningful contributions to the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and soundness in its approach. The theoretical foundations combining world models with causal inference are well-established, and the mathematical formulations of the model components and loss functions are technically correct. The training procedure is well-justified, with clear explanations of how counterfactual data will be generated and used. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, showing awareness of technical constraints. One minor limitation is that the proposal could more explicitly address potential issues with the counterfactual loss function, such as how it might interact with the standard prediction loss and potential optimization difficulties. Overall, the approach is methodologically sound and well-grounded in established theory."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and methods. The use of established simulation environments (MuJoCo, Habitat) for generating counterfactual data is practical and appropriate. The model architectures build on existing frameworks (Transformers, SSMs, DreamerV3), making implementation straightforward. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) Generating accurate counterfactual data at scale might be computationally expensive, especially for complex environments; (2) The proposal requires access to simulators that allow precise state setting and intervention, which may limit applicability to certain domains; (3) The computational resources needed for training world models with additional counterfactual objectives could be substantial. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could provide more detailed mitigation strategies. Despite these concerns, the research is implementable with current resources and technology, particularly in the controlled environments specified."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical limitation in current world models - their lack of causal understanding - which has significant implications for their robustness, generalization, and applicability in real-world scenarios. Enhancing world models with causal reasoning capabilities could lead to important advances in several domains highlighted in the workshop scope, including robotics, healthcare, and scientific discovery. The potential impact on safety-critical applications is particularly noteworthy, as improved counterfactual reasoning could lead to more reliable decision-making under uncertainty. The proposal also contributes methodologically to the integration of causal inference with deep learning, which is an important research direction. While the immediate practical impact might be limited to simulated environments, the conceptual advances could influence future work on more complex, real-world applications. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and aligns them well with the workshop's themes."
