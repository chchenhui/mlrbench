    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of integrating multi-modal foundation models with embodied AI agents, which is the core focus of the task. The two-tiered architecture proposed in the research idea is comprehensively developed in the proposal, with detailed explanations of how the frozen MFM processes multimodal inputs and how the hierarchical RL controller translates semantic understanding into actionable commands. The proposal also effectively incorporates insights from the literature review, referencing H2O2, PaLM-E, and HIDIO to support its approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning and multimodal integration. The methodology addresses all five key challenges identified in the literature review: bridging semantics and control, sample efficiency, generalization, multimodal integration, and real-world transferability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with precision, including mathematical formulations for the semantic affordance maps, goal representations, and training objectives. The hierarchical architecture is well-defined, with clear distinctions between the upper tier (semantic encoder) and lower tier (hierarchical RL). The experimental design is comprehensive, with specific evaluation environments, metrics, and baseline comparisons. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as the exact mechanism for generating pseudo-instructions during self-supervised exploration and more details on how the noise-injection modules would work for real-world transfer. Overall, the proposal is highly understandable and well-articulated, with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel integration of frozen multi-modal foundation models with hierarchical reinforcement learning for embodied agents. While individual components like hierarchical RL and multimodal perception have been explored in prior work (as cited in the literature review), the specific combination and implementation approach is innovative. The use of MFMs to generate semantic affordance maps and goal representations that guide hierarchical RL policies represents a fresh perspective on bridging high-level semantics with low-level control. The self-supervised exploration mechanism using MFM-generated pseudo-instructions is particularly innovative. However, the approach builds significantly on existing methods like H2O2 and HIDIO, adapting them rather than introducing entirely new paradigms. The proposal extends rather than revolutionizes current approaches, offering meaningful but incremental innovation in the integration of these technologies."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for the semantic encoder, hierarchical policies, and training objectives are well-defined and theoretically sound. The approach is grounded in established reinforcement learning techniques (PPO, DDPG) and builds upon proven hierarchical frameworks (H2O2, HIDIO). The three-stage training protocol is well-justified, with clear progression from upper tier bootstrapping to end-to-end finetuning. The experimental design includes appropriate evaluation metrics, baseline comparisons, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and challenges, such as MFM misrepresentation of rare affordances and real-time inference latency. However, some aspects could benefit from more detailed justification, such as the specific choice of fusion mechanisms for multimodal integration and the rationale behind the synthetic reward formulation. Overall, the technical approach is robust and well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation requirements. The use of existing simulation environments (ThreeDWorld, Habitat, PyBullet) and foundation models (CLIP, LLaVA) reduces development overhead. The data collection strategy is practical, with reasonable quantities of exploration episodes (10,000) and expert demonstrations (5,000). The three-stage training protocol is implementable with current RL algorithms and computational resources. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The computational requirements for training and inference with large MFMs may be substantial, potentially limiting real-time performance; (2) The real-world transfer experiments require physical robot hardware and domain adaptation techniques that may introduce unforeseen challenges; (3) The generation of high-quality pseudo-instructions from MFMs may be more difficult than anticipated, potentially affecting the bootstrapping phase. While these challenges are acknowledged in the proposal, they represent non-trivial implementation hurdles. Overall, the approach is feasible but with moderate implementation challenges that would require careful management."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in embodied AI: the integration of semantic understanding from foundation models with precise control for physical interaction. This research has significant potential impact across robotics and embodied AI applications. The expected outcomes—improved sample efficiency, enhanced generalization, and real-world viability—would represent meaningful advances in the field. The framework's ability to democratize robotic intelligence by leveraging pre-trained MFMs without extensive fine-tuning could substantially reduce the barriers to deploying intelligent robots in diverse environments. The potential applications span warehouse automation, domestic assistance, and other domains requiring physical interaction guided by semantic understanding. The projected improvements (1.5× reduction in training episodes, 20% improvement in zero-shot transfer) would constitute meaningful progress. The research also addresses fundamental questions about system architecture for MFM-based embodied agents, which aligns directly with the workshop's focus. While not completely transformative, the work has clear significance for advancing the integration of foundation models with embodied AI."
