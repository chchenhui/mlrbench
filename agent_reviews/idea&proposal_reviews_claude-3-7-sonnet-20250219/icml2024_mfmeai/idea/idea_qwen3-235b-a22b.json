        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description of exploring Multi-modal Foundation Models (MFMs) for Embodied AI. It directly addresses several key challenges mentioned in the task: system architecture for MFM-based agents, balancing high-level decision-making with low-level control requirements, and framework design for MFM-powered embodied agents. The proposed hierarchical framework specifically tackles the integration of MFMs with robotic control systems, which is central to the workshop's focus. The idea also touches on evaluation in physical environments, though it could have elaborated more on open-ended training scenarios."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined problem (bridging high-level MFM reasoning with low-level control) and a structured solution approach. The three-component framework (MFMs for high-level understanding, RL agents for translation, and bidirectional feedback) is clearly explained. The concrete example of pouring coffee helps illustrate the concept effectively. The training methodology using hybrid simulation-physical data is also well-specified. However, some minor ambiguities remain about the exact mechanisms of the bidirectional feedback loop and how the system would handle failures or edge cases, preventing a perfect score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to dynamically integrating MFMs with embodied control systems. The dynamic hierarchical framework with bidirectional feedback represents a fresh perspective on combining foundation models with robotics. The adaptive translation layer using RL agents to bridge semantic reasoning and control is particularly innovative. However, hierarchical approaches in robotics and the use of language models for high-level planning are not entirely new concepts. The innovation lies more in the specific integration approach and feedback mechanisms rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. The use of existing MFMs (GPT-4V, LLaVA) and established RL techniques provides a solid foundation. The hybrid simulation-physical training approach is practical for addressing sim-to-real gaps. However, creating effective bidirectional feedback loops between high-level MFMs and low-level controllers presents significant technical challenges, particularly in real-time scenarios. The computational requirements for running MFMs in embodied systems, despite the proposed decoupling, remain substantial. Additionally, training robust RL agents for the translation layer would require extensive data and experimentation, making this a resource-intensive project with moderate implementation hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in embodied AI - the integration of powerful semantic reasoning from MFMs with physical control systems. Successfully bridging this gap would significantly advance the field of robotic manipulation and embodied AI more broadly. The potential applications in assistive robotics and autonomous exploration highlight its real-world impact. The approach could enable more intuitive human-robot interaction through natural language commands and improve generalization to novel objects and tasks. The significance is high because it tackles a fundamental bottleneck in current embodied AI systems, though it focuses primarily on manipulation tasks rather than addressing the full spectrum of embodied AI challenges."
