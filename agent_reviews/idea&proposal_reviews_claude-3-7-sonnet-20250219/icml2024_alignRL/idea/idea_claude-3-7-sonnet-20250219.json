        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea of creating benchmark translations between theoretical and practical RL settings aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses the core problem identified in the task: the gap between RL theory and practice. The proposal specifically targets the communication of existing results between communities and identifies new problem classes of practical interest, which are the two main desiderata mentioned in the task. The idea of creating leaderboards that track both theoretical metrics and practical performance measures perfectly serves the goal of bringing theorists and experimentalists together."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (disconnect between theoretical and practical RL), proposes a specific solution (benchmark translations), and outlines concrete examples of how this would work in both directions (theory-to-practice and practice-to-theory). The concept of a leaderboard with dual metrics is also well-explained. However, the idea could benefit from more specifics on the methodology for creating these translations - what exact principles would guide the translation process to ensure theoretical properties are preserved while adding real-world complexity, and vice versa."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea of systematically bridging theoretical and practical RL through benchmark translations is relatively novel. While there have been individual efforts to create theoretically-grounded benchmarks or to simplify practical problems for analysis, the proposal for a comprehensive framework that works bidirectionally and includes standardized evaluation metrics is innovative. However, the core concept of bridging theory and practice is not entirely new in machine learning research, and some aspects of this work have been attempted in piecemeal fashion before, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. Creating faithful translations between theoretical settings and practical benchmarks that preserve the essential properties is technically difficult. For example, translating a tabular MDP to a complex environment while maintaining its theoretical structure requires careful design. Similarly, simplifying Atari games while preserving core challenges is non-trivial. The leaderboard with dual metrics is feasible but would require significant community buy-in. The project would likely require substantial resources and expertise spanning both theoretical and experimental RL, making it moderately challenging but not impossible to implement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning that has significant implications for the field's progress. Successfully bridging the gap between theory and practice could accelerate advances in both areas by enabling theorists to develop more relevant algorithms and helping experimentalists understand why certain approaches work or fail. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications of RL in various domains. By creating a common vocabulary and shared benchmarks, this work could fundamentally change how RL research is conducted and evaluated, potentially leading to algorithms that combine strong theoretical guarantees with excellent practical performance."
