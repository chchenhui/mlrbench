        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task of bridging the gap between RL theory and practice. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bringing theorists and experimentalists together by creating a common framework (complexity profiling) that can be understood and utilized by both communities. The idea of measuring complexity metrics across environments and matching them to appropriate algorithms addresses the challenge mentioned in the task description about theoretical algorithms being hard to apply to real-world problems. The proposal also aims to identify which complexity classes are most prevalent in practice, which aligns with the desideratum of identifying new problem classes of practical interest. However, it doesn't explicitly address the 'communicate existing results' aspect of the workshop, focusing more on creating new tools rather than synthesizing existing knowledge."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure: develop a toolkit to measure complexity metrics, cluster environments by complexity, and create feedback loops for algorithm selection and theoretical analysis. The key components (complexity metrics, clustering approach, and feedback loops) are identified, though some aspects could benefit from further elaboration. For instance, the exact methodology for measuring metrics like Bellman rank in complex environments isn't specified, nor is the precise clustering approach. The validation strategy is mentioned but lacks specific metrics or benchmarks that would be used. While the overall concept is understandable, these gaps in detail prevent it from receiving a higher clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea presents a highly innovative approach to a fundamental problem in RL. While both theoretical complexity measures and empirical benchmarking exist separately, creating a systematic framework that bridges them through complexity profiling represents a novel contribution. The concept of deriving 'complexity signatures' for environments and using these to guide both algorithm selection and theoretical research priorities is particularly original. The bidirectional feedback loops between theory and practice represent a fresh perspective on how to align these communities. The approach doesn't just apply existing methods in a new domain but proposes a new methodology for understanding and categorizing RL problems that could fundamentally change how researchers approach algorithm development and analysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several significant challenges. Measuring theoretical complexity metrics like Bellman rank in complex environments is non-trivial and may require approximations that could undermine the precision needed for meaningful clustering. Creating a reliable algorithm selection module would require extensive benchmarking across many algorithms and environments, which is computationally expensive. The theoretical analysis pipeline would need buy-in from theorists to focus on the identified complexity classes. While the individual components (measuring metrics, clustering, algorithm selection) are feasible with current technology, integrating them into a cohesive system that delivers statistically significant improvements across diverse environments is ambitious. The idea is implementable but would require considerable resources, expertise across both theoretical and experimental RL, and potentially several iterations to refine."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning that has significant implications for both theoretical advancement and practical applications. If successful, it could transform how RL algorithms are developed, analyzed, and selected for specific problems. By creating a common language around complexity metrics, it could enable more targeted theoretical work on practically relevant problem classes and help practitioners select algorithms with stronger guarantees. This would accelerate progress in applying RL to real-world problems by reducing the trial-and-error approach currently prevalent. The potential impact extends beyond academic research to industrial applications of RL, where algorithm selection and reliability are critical concerns. The significance is heightened by the growing importance of RL in various domains from robotics to healthcare to autonomous systems."
