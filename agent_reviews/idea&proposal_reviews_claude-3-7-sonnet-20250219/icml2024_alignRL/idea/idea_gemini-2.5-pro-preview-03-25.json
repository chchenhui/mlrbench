        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description of bridging the gap between RL theorists and experimentalists. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of understanding why empirically successful heuristics work, which is explicitly mentioned as a key challenge in the task description. The proposal aims to provide theoretical grounding for practical RL techniques, which perfectly matches the workshop's desideratum of 'communicating existing results' across the theory-practice divide. It also addresses the second desideratum by identifying 'problem classes of practical interest' through analyzing empirically successful algorithms that lack theoretical understanding."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured with clear motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The proposal clearly identifies the problem (lack of theoretical understanding of empirical heuristics), the approach (isolating and analyzing specific heuristics in simplified models), and the expected outcome (theoretical results explaining empirical benefits). The methodology involving tools from optimization theory, statistical learning theory, and function approximation is specified. However, it could benefit from more concrete examples of which specific heuristics would be prioritized for analysis and more details on the analytical models or environments to be designed, which would make the implementation path more transparent."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers a fresh perspective by focusing on reverse-engineering the theoretical principles behind empirically successful heuristics, rather than the more common approach of developing theory first and then applications. This reverse direction is relatively uncommon in RL research. However, the general concept of bridging theory and practice in RL is not entirely new, and similar approaches have been applied to specific algorithms or techniques in isolation. The novelty lies more in the systematic and comprehensive approach to analyzing multiple heuristics across popular algorithms, rather than in the fundamental concept itself."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research faces several challenges. Isolating the effects of specific heuristics in complex RL algorithms is difficult, as these components often interact in non-trivial ways. Creating simplified yet representative models that maintain the essential characteristics of the original problem is also challenging. Additionally, theoretical analysis tools may not be readily applicable to all heuristics, especially those that work through complex emergent behaviors. The proposal acknowledges these challenges implicitly by suggesting simplified models, but doesn't fully address how to overcome the fundamental difficulty of analyzing heuristics that may work for reasons not easily captured by current theoretical frameworks. The research is feasible but would likely require significant methodological innovations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a fundamental gap in RL that has significant implications for both theory and practice. Understanding why empirically successful heuristics work would enable more principled algorithm design, better generalization, and potentially more efficient learning. It could transform the current trial-and-error approach to algorithm development into a more systematic process guided by theoretical insights. The impact would extend beyond academic interest to practical applications of RL across domains. By providing theoretical grounding for empirical successes, this research could accelerate progress in the field by allowing researchers to build on each other's work more effectively, rather than reinventing heuristics for each new problem domain."
