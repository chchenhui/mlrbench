        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description of bridging the gap between RL theorists and experimentalists. It directly addresses the core challenge mentioned in the task by proposing to reverse-engineer empirical heuristics that work in practice but lack theoretical justification. The idea specifically targets the disconnect highlighted in the task description where 'theoretical algorithms often focus on simplified settings' while 'specialized algorithms offer empirical success' without theoretical understanding. The proposal to derive theoretical guarantees for empirical heuristics perfectly matches the workshop's goal of identifying 'new problem classes of practical interest' and 'communicating existing results' across the theory-practice divide."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure: analyze heuristics, formalize assumptions, derive theoretical guarantees, and develop hybrid algorithms. The specific example of reward shaping helps illustrate the approach. The methodology is well-defined, involving both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. However, the idea could benefit from more specificity about which particular heuristics will be analyzed first and what metrics will be used to evaluate the success of the theoretical frameworks developed. While the overall direction is clear, some implementation details remain somewhat abstract, preventing a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea presents a fresh approach by reversing the typical direction of RL research. Instead of developing theory first and then applying it, this work proposes to start with empirical successes and work backward to develop theory. This reverse-engineering approach is relatively uncommon in formal RL research. However, the concept of analyzing heuristics to understand their theoretical underpinnings is not entirely new in machine learning broadly. Similar approaches have been used in other ML domains to understand why certain techniques work. The novelty lies more in the systematic application to RL heuristics specifically, rather than in the methodological approach itself."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. Deriving theoretical guarantees for heuristics that were developed without theoretical foundations may prove difficult, as these heuristics often work for complex, non-obvious reasons. The proposal requires expertise in both theoretical RL and practical implementations, which is a demanding combination. Additionally, some heuristics may work due to properties that are hard to formalize mathematically. The experimental validation component is feasible, but connecting experimental results back to theory might be challenging. The idea is implementable but will likely require significant effort and may need to be scoped to specific classes of heuristics rather than attempting to cover all empirical techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning that has significant implications for the field's progress. Successfully bridging the theory-practice gap would enable more reliable, generalizable RL algorithms with stronger theoretical foundations. This could lead to increased trust in RL systems and better performance in real-world applications. The impact extends beyond academic interest to practical deployment of RL in critical domains. By formalizing the implicit knowledge embedded in successful heuristics, the research could also lead to new theoretical insights about what makes RL work in practice. This work directly addresses the core motivation of the described workshop and could significantly influence how RL research is conducted."
