        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the gap between RL theory and practice, which is the central focus of the workshop. The proposal specifically aims to extract patterns from empirical successes and formalize them as theoretical assumptions, which perfectly matches the workshop's goal of bridging theorists and experimentalists. The idea also supports both key desiderata: it facilitates communication of existing results through meta-analysis and identifies new problem classes of practical interest by formalizing empirical heuristics into theoretical frameworks. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address how to handle cases where algorithms fail despite expectations, though this could be incorporated into the meta-analysis phase."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. The proposed approach follows a logical progression: meta-analysis of successful empirical methods, translation of heuristics into mathematical properties, algorithm design with provable guarantees, and validation. The methodology is specific enough to understand the general approach while allowing flexibility in implementation. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific criteria for selecting which empirical methods to analyze, the exact process for translating heuristics into mathematical properties, and how to handle conflicting heuristics across different domains. Despite these minor ambiguities, the overall idea is presented with sufficient clarity to be understood and evaluated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea presents a fresh approach to a persistent problem in RL research. While the gap between theory and practice has been acknowledged for years, the systematic methodology proposed here—specifically the formalization of empirical heuristics into theoretical assumptions—offers an innovative framework for addressing this issue. The concept of creating a shared repository of problem classes aligned with real-world structures is particularly novel. However, the individual components (meta-analysis, formalization of heuristics, algorithm design) are established research methods. The novelty lies in their integration and application to bridge the theory-practice gap rather than in developing fundamentally new techniques. The approach builds upon existing work in both theoretical and experimental RL rather than introducing a completely new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate implementation challenges. The meta-analysis of successful empirical methods is straightforward, but translating heuristics into mathematical properties requires significant expertise in both theoretical and applied RL. This translation process may be particularly difficult for complex heuristics that lack obvious mathematical formulations. Additionally, designing algorithms with provable guarantees under the derived assumptions is a challenging task that may not always be possible. The validation phase is feasible but time-consuming, requiring extensive experimentation across diverse domains. The project would likely require a multidisciplinary team with both theoretical and practical expertise, substantial computational resources, and a significant time investment. While challenging, these obstacles are not insurmountable, making the idea moderately feasible with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning that has significant implications for the field's advancement. Successfully bridging the gap between theory and practice could accelerate RL adoption in critical domains by improving both robustness and performance. The creation of a shared repository of problem classes would provide lasting value to the research community, potentially becoming a standard reference for future work. The framework could foster collaboration between theorists and experimentalists, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement in RL algorithms. Beyond academic impact, the practical benefits could extend to industries relying on RL for decision-making systems, including robotics, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that even with this framework, some domains may still require specialized approaches, but the overall potential impact on the field is substantial."
