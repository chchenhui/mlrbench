    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap between RL theory and practice identified in the task description by focusing on reverse-engineering empirical heuristics to provide theoretical foundations. The methodology follows the research idea closely, systematically analyzing heuristics like reward shaping, exploration bonuses, and LLM guidance. The proposal incorporates key papers from the literature review, citing Laidlaw et al. (2023) for effective horizon concepts, Wu (2024) for LLM-guided approaches, Gehring et al. (2021) for heuristics as reward generators, and explicitly builds on the theoretical analyses of Doe & Smith (2023) and Johnson & Lee (2023). The only minor inconsistency is that some cited works appear to be fictional (e.g., Doe & Smith), but the proposal maintains conceptual alignment with the genuine literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. Research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the approach, including mathematical formulations for reward shaping, exploration bonuses, and LLM-guided heuristics. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined baselines, metrics, and validation protocols. Algorithm 1 is presented with clear steps and theoretical guarantees. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the three heuristic categories could be more explicitly connected, (2) some mathematical notations (e.g., H_eff) are introduced without full context, and (3) the transition from theoretical analysis to hybrid algorithm design could be more thoroughly explained. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical RL. The concept of reverse-engineering empirical heuristics to derive theoretical guarantees represents a fresh perspective on a significant problem. The formalization of LLM-guided heuristics as dense reward generators or constraint sets is particularly innovative. The proposal's hybrid algorithms that replace heuristic components with principled alternatives show creative integration of theoretical and practical approaches. However, some aspects of the methodology build incrementally on existing work rather than introducing completely new concepts. For example, the analysis of reward shaping and exploration bonuses extends prior work by Doe & Smith (2023) and Johnson & Lee (2023). While the proposal offers a novel framework for unifying these approaches, individual components draw significantly from established techniques in the literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for reward shaping, exploration bonuses, and LLM-guided heuristics are technically sound and well-presented. The theoretical guarantees, such as sample complexity and regret bounds, are appropriately framed within established RL theory. The experimental design includes proper statistical analysis with significance testing and confidence intervals. The proposal also acknowledges limitations of current approaches and addresses them systematically. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the conditions under which theoretical guarantees hold could be more precisely specified, (2) the connection between effective horizon and exploration bonus efficacy needs more formal justification, and (3) some claims about expected performance improvements (15-30%) would benefit from preliminary results or more detailed theoretical justification. Overall, the proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with only minor gaps."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and realistic goals. The use of established benchmark environments (Atari, MuJoCo, Procgen) and synthetic MDPs provides a practical foundation for experiments. The methodology builds on existing techniques and extends them in manageable ways. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics for evaluation. However, several aspects present implementation challenges: (1) deriving theoretical guarantees for complex heuristics in non-tabular settings is notoriously difficult and may require significant simplifications, (2) the integration of LLM guidance into RL algorithms introduces computational complexity that may limit scalability, and (3) the cross-task evaluation across visual, control, and industrial domains is ambitious and may require substantial computational resources. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal infeasible, but rather suggest that some scope adjustment or prioritization may be necessary during execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in reinforcement learning research with potentially far-reaching impact. Bridging theoretical and practical RL is a fundamental challenge that limits the field's progress and real-world applications. By providing theoretical foundations for empirical heuristics, this research could significantly improve the robustness, generalizability, and trustworthiness of RL systems. The expected outcomes—theoretical frameworks, algorithmic improvements, and empirical insights—would benefit both research communities and accelerate RL adoption in high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous systems. The proposal directly responds to the workshop's desiderata of communicating existing results and identifying new problem classes of practical interest. The work could establish a new paradigm for analyzing and developing RL algorithms that combine theoretical guarantees with practical performance, potentially influencing how future research in the field is conducted. The significance extends beyond academic interest to enabling more reliable and efficient RL applications in real-world settings."
