    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap between theoretical and experimental RL research as outlined in the task description, focusing on reverse-engineering successful heuristics to provide theoretical foundations. The methodology follows the research idea closely, systematically analyzing heuristics, deriving theoretical guarantees, and developing hybrid algorithms. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, citing works like Laidlaw et al. (2023) on effective horizons, Gehring et al. (2021) on heuristics as reward generators, and Cheng et al. (2021) on heuristic-guided RL. It also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as lack of theoretical justification for heuristics and the theory-practice gap. The only minor inconsistency is that some of the cited papers in the proposal (e.g., Doe and Smith, Johnson and Lee) don't appear in the literature review, but this doesn't significantly impact the overall alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the four-phase methodology (identification, theoretical analysis, algorithm development, and experimental validation) is well-defined with specific steps and examples. Mathematical formulations are presented clearly, such as the equations for reward shaping and exploration bonuses. The experimental design is comprehensive, detailing environments, baselines, and metrics. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification: the specific theoretical tools that will be used to analyze heuristics could be more detailed, and the connection between the theoretical analysis and algorithm development could be more explicitly defined. Additionally, some technical terms and concepts might benefit from brief explanations for readers less familiar with RL theory."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a fresh perspective by systematically reverse-engineering successful RL heuristics to provide theoretical foundations, which is a relatively underexplored approach. The idea of creating a taxonomy of heuristic modifications and their mathematical properties is innovative, as is the development of hybrid algorithms that replace heuristic components with theoretically grounded alternatives. The proposal builds upon existing work (e.g., Laidlaw's effective horizon, Cheng's heuristic-guided RL) but extends it in new directions. However, some aspects of the methodology, such as the use of potential-based reward shaping and information-theoretic exploration bonuses, draw heavily from established techniques. While the comprehensive approach to bridging theory and practice is valuable, the individual components are not entirely groundbreaking. The proposal would benefit from more explicit discussion of how its approach differs from previous attempts to bridge theory and practice in RL."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The mathematical formulations for analyzing heuristics, such as the equations for reward shaping and exploration bonuses, are technically correct and well-presented. The methodology follows a logical progression from formalization to theoretical analysis to algorithm development and experimental validation. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate environments, baselines, and metrics. The proposal also acknowledges the limitations of current approaches and addresses them systematically. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: the theoretical analysis could provide more specific details on the mathematical tools and techniques that will be used to derive guarantees, and the conditions under which the theoretical results hold could be more explicitly stated. Additionally, while the proposal mentions comparing observed sample efficiency with theoretical predictions, it could provide more detail on how discrepancies between theory and practice will be addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible research plan with clear steps and methodologies. The four-phase approach provides a structured way to tackle the research questions, and the experimental design is comprehensive and realistic. The use of established benchmarks and environments (CartPole, MuJoCo, Atari) is practical and appropriate. However, the scope of the project is quite ambitious, covering multiple categories of heuristics (reward shaping, exploration strategies, value function initialization, architecture heuristics) and developing hybrid algorithms for each. This breadth might be challenging to accomplish within a typical research timeframe. Additionally, the theoretical analysis of complex heuristics used in deep RL might be more challenging than anticipated, especially when dealing with neural network function approximators. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential challenges and mitigation strategies, as well as a clearer prioritization of which heuristics to focus on if time constraints become an issue."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in reinforcement learning research: the disconnect between theoretical guarantees and practical implementations. By providing theoretical foundations for successful heuristics, the research has the potential to significantly impact both theoretical understanding and practical algorithm design in RL. The expected outcomes—formal characterization of heuristics, novel theoretical guarantees, hybrid algorithm designs, and empirical validation—would make substantial contributions to the field. The practical impact is also well-articulated, including more reliable RL systems, improved generalization, efficient algorithm selection, and development tools. The long-term vision of transforming the relationship between theoretical and empirical approaches in RL aligns perfectly with the workshop's desiderata of communicating existing results across communities and identifying new problem classes of practical interest. The significance is further enhanced by the potential to create a unified research approach that bridges traditional divides in the field."
