    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap between RL theory and practice identified in the task description by focusing on analyzing and formalizing heuristics that work empirically but lack theoretical justification. The proposal follows the exact research direction outlined in the idea, including the systematic analysis of heuristics, formalization of implicit assumptions, derivation of theoretical guarantees, and development of hybrid algorithms. The methodology incorporates the literature review's insights on various heuristics (reward shaping, exploration bonuses) and addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as lack of theoretical justification, sample efficiency concerns, and generalization issues. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions experimental validation, it could have more explicitly connected to specific empirical successes mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction effectively establishes the context and motivation for the research. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to addressing the research questions, including literature review, formalization of heuristics, theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and experimental validation. The evaluation metrics are clearly defined, and the experimental design is well-thought-out. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The proposal could provide more concrete examples of specific heuristics to be analyzed, (2) The mathematical formalism that will be used for the theoretical analysis could be more explicitly described, and (3) The proposal could more clearly specify how the hybrid algorithms will be designed and implemented. Despite these minor issues, the overall structure and presentation of the proposal are logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its systematic approach to reverse-engineering empirical heuristics in RL. While the general idea of bridging theory and practice in RL is not new, the specific focus on formalizing implicit assumptions behind heuristics and developing hybrid algorithms that replace heuristics with principled components represents a fresh perspective. The proposal builds upon existing literature but offers a novel framework for analyzing and improving RL algorithms. The approach of deriving theoretical guarantees for empirical heuristics and then using these insights to develop hybrid algorithms is innovative. However, the proposal shares similarities with some existing approaches mentioned in the literature review (e.g., papers 5-10), which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature. The novelty lies more in the comprehensive and systematic approach rather than in introducing entirely new concepts or methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in established RL theory and practice. The research methodology follows a logical progression from literature review to theoretical analysis to algorithm design and experimental validation. The evaluation metrics (sample efficiency, regret, generalization, convergence) are appropriate for assessing the performance of RL algorithms. The proposal acknowledges the challenges in bridging theory and practice and proposes reasonable approaches to address them. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The proposal lacks specific mathematical formulations or theoretical frameworks that will be used for the analysis, (2) It does not explicitly address how it will handle the complexity and diversity of heuristics used in practice, and (3) The conditions under which theoretical guarantees will be derived could be more precisely defined. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and based on established principles in RL research."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a somewhat feasible research plan, but there are significant challenges that may affect its implementation. The systematic analysis of heuristics and the development of hybrid algorithms are achievable with current knowledge and technology. The experimental validation on real-world tasks is also feasible given appropriate resources. However, several aspects raise concerns about feasibility: (1) The scope of analyzing 'widely used empirical heuristics' is potentially very broad, and a comprehensive analysis of all such heuristics would require substantial time and resources, (2) Deriving theoretical guarantees for heuristics that have resisted formalization may prove extremely challenging, (3) The proposal does not specify the computational resources required for the experimental validation, which could be substantial for complex RL tasks, and (4) The timeline for completing all five phases of the methodology is not provided, making it difficult to assess temporal feasibility. While the individual components of the research are feasible, the comprehensive nature of the proposal may present implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant gap in RL research and has the potential for substantial impact. By bridging the divide between theoretical and empirical approaches to RL, the research could lead to more robust, generalizable, and trustworthy RL algorithms. The expected outcomes—formalized heuristics, theoretical guarantees, hybrid algorithms, and experimental validation—would make valuable contributions to the field. The impact on enhanced generalizability, improved sample efficiency, and reduced bias in RL algorithms would be particularly valuable for advancing both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of RL. The proposal also aligns well with the workshop's goal of bringing theorists and experimentalists together, potentially fostering collaboration and cross-fertilization of ideas. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the proposal focuses on analyzing existing heuristics rather than developing entirely new approaches, but the systematic formalization and theoretical analysis of these heuristics would still represent a significant advancement in the field."
