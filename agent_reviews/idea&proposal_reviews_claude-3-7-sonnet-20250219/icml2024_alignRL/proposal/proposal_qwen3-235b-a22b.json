    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap between RL theory and practice by reverse-engineering empirical heuristics to provide theoretical foundations. The methodology follows the research idea closely, focusing on formalizing heuristics, deriving theoretical guarantees, and developing hybrid algorithms. The proposal incorporates most of the literature cited, referencing works by Laidlaw et al. (2023), Wu (2024), Gehring et al. (2021), Cheng et al. (2021), and others. It specifically addresses the workshop's desiderata of communicating existing results and identifying new problem classes of practical interest. The only minor inconsistency is that some cited papers (e.g., Doe & Smith, 2023; Johnson & Lee, 2023) appear to be fictional references created for the proposal rather than actual papers from the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical sequence with appropriate headings. The introduction effectively establishes the background, identifies the gap between theory and practice, and outlines specific challenges. The methodology section provides concrete steps with mathematical formulations that illustrate the approach. The expected outcomes section clearly delineates theoretical and practical contributions. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as how the effective horizon will be estimated in practice for the EHGE algorithm, and more details on the experimental design for validating the theoretical guarantees. Additionally, while mathematical formulations are included, some equations (e.g., the bias-variance trade-off equation) would benefit from more context about how they will be derived or estimated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to bridging theory and practice in RL by systematically reverse-engineering empirical heuristics. The concept of analyzing heuristics to uncover their implicit assumptions and translate them into principled algorithmic components is innovative. The proposed hybrid algorithms (ARS, EHGE, LLM-Enhanced Planning) represent fresh combinations of existing concepts with theoretical foundations. However, the core idea of formalizing heuristics has been explored in some prior work (as evidenced by the literature review), and the proposal builds incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing entirely new paradigms. The novelty lies more in the systematic framework for analyzing multiple heuristics and the specific hybrid algorithms proposed, rather than in a fundamentally new theoretical approach or algorithm design."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. It builds upon established concepts in RL theory, such as regret bounds, bias-variance trade-offs, and potential-based reward shaping. The mathematical formulations are generally correct and well-presented. The methodology follows a logical progression from heuristic selection to theoretical analysis to algorithm design and validation. However, there are some areas where the theoretical soundness could be strengthened. For instance, the regret bound analysis assumes a low-rank MDP structure without fully justifying this assumption or discussing its limitations. The bias-variance trade-off equation for reward shaping is presented without a clear derivation or justification. Additionally, while the proposal mentions analyzing heuristics under 'realistic MDP assumptions,' it could more explicitly address how these assumptions relate to the complexity of real-world environments."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible research plan, but with several significant challenges. The scope is ambitious, covering multiple heuristics (reward shaping, exploration bonuses, heuristic-guided planning) and proposing three hybrid algorithms. The experimental validation across three benchmark suites (Classical Planning, Robotics Simulation, Procedurally Generated Games) is extensive. While each component is feasible in isolation, the comprehensive approach may require substantial resources and time. The theoretical analysis of heuristics, particularly deriving regret bounds and bias-variance trade-offs, is mathematically complex and may encounter unforeseen difficulties. The integration of LLMs as approximate solvers with theoretical guarantees is particularly challenging given the black-box nature of these models. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed timeline and prioritization of research objectives to ensure feasibility within a reasonable timeframe. Additionally, the computational resources required for the extensive experimental validation are not addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in reinforcement learning research with potentially high impact. Bridging the divide between theoretical guarantees and empirical heuristics could significantly advance the field by enabling more robust, generalizable, and trustworthy RL algorithms. The work could lead to practical algorithms with theoretical guarantees, addressing key challenges in sample efficiency, generalization, and reliability. The focus on democratizing theoretical insights and making them accessible to practitioners is particularly valuable. The proposal's emphasis on creating a benchmark suite for evaluating theory-practice trade-offs could provide a lasting contribution to the research community. The potential applications span important domains including robotics, planning, and game environments, with implications for safety-critical applications like healthcare and autonomous driving. While the immediate impact depends on the success of the proposed hybrid algorithms, the systematic framework for analyzing heuristics provides value regardless of specific algorithmic outcomes."
