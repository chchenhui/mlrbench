        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the workshop's focus on spurious correlations, invariance, and stability. It directly addresses the need for methods to discover and diagnose spurious correlations, which is explicitly listed as a solicited topic. The proposal specifically targets two of the example domains mentioned in the task description: X-ray scanner marks in medical imaging and lexical overlap in NLP. The adaptive counterfactual stress testing framework also addresses model stability evaluation, another solicited topic. The proposed invariance-regularizer for retraining aligns with the workshop's interest in learning robust models in the presence of spurious correlations. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address the relationship between methods from causal ML, algorithmic fairness, and OOD generalization, though the approach implicitly touches on causal reasoning and OOD generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity. The three-step process is well-articulated: (1) learning a structured perturbation graph, (2) generating counterfactual variants, and (3) measuring prediction drift to score dependencies. The concept of incrementally building a perturbation graph by selecting features that maximize model instability is clearly explained. The application domains (chest X-rays and NLI benchmarks) are specified with concrete examples of the spurious correlations being targeted. The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration - for instance, how exactly the structured perturbation graph is constructed using generative models, what specific invariance-regularizer will be used during retraining, and how the system will distinguish between genuinely important features and spurious ones. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to spurious correlation discovery. The adaptive nature of the counterfactual stress tester, which incrementally builds a perturbation graph focusing on areas of highest model instability, appears to be an innovative approach to efficiently exploring the feature space. The combination of counterfactual generation with structured exploration guided by model sensitivity is a fresh perspective. However, many of the individual components draw from existing work: counterfactual generation, feature importance analysis, and invariance regularization are established techniques in the robustness literature. The integration of these components into a systematic framework for spurious correlation discovery is where the novelty primarily lies, rather than in fundamentally new algorithmic innovations. The approach builds upon rather than revolutionizes existing methods for addressing spurious correlations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but faces some implementation challenges. The proposed approach relies on generative models to create counterfactual variants, which is achievable with current technology, especially in domains like images and text where generative models have made significant progress. The validation domains (chest X-rays and NLI) are well-studied with available datasets. However, several practical challenges exist: (1) generating realistic counterfactuals that only modify the targeted features while preserving other aspects is non-trivial, (2) the computational cost of incrementally building and exploring the perturbation graph could be substantial for high-dimensional inputs, (3) distinguishing between spurious correlations and genuine causal relationships automatically may be difficult in complex domains, and (4) the effectiveness of the invariance-regularizer during retraining depends on how well the spurious features have been identified. These challenges are surmountable but will require careful implementation and possibly domain-specific adaptations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in machine learning: the reliance on spurious correlations that lead to poor generalization. The significance is high because: (1) it tackles a fundamental issue affecting model deployment across domains, (2) it provides a systematic framework for discovering hidden dependencies before deployment, potentially preventing costly failures, (3) it includes not just detection but also mitigation through retraining, and (4) the proposed open-source stress-testing suite would be valuable to practitioners across fields. The impact could be substantial in high-stakes domains like medical imaging where undetected spurious correlations can have serious consequences. The approach is also generalizable across different application areas. However, the ultimate significance depends on how effectively the method can identify subtle or complex spurious correlations compared to existing approaches, and whether the invariance-regularized retraining genuinely improves robustness in practice, which remains to be demonstrated."
