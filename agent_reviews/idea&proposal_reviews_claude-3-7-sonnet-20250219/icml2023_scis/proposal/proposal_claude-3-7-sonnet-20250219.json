        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on spurious correlations in machine learning by proposing the Adversarial Counterfactual Augmentation (ACA) framework. The proposal covers all three example domains mentioned in the task (medical imaging, NLP, and precision medicine) and addresses the solicited topics of discovering spurious correlations and learning robust models. The methodology follows the core idea outlined in the research idea, implementing the three-step process: identifying spurious features, generating counterfactuals, and retraining with consistency loss. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by addressing the key challenges identified, particularly working without group annotations and handling complex spurious features. The experimental design includes relevant datasets mentioned in both the task description and literature review, such as CelebA and medical imaging datasets."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable and implementable. Each component of the ACA framework is thoroughly explained, including spurious feature identification, counterfactual generation, and robust model training. The experimental design clearly outlines datasets, implementation details, and evaluation metrics for each domain. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the adversarial component and the counterfactual generation could be more explicitly connected, (2) some of the mathematical notation could be more consistently defined across sections, and (3) the transition between identifying spurious features and creating masks for the generative model could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of several existing techniques into a cohesive framework for addressing spurious correlations. The combination of influence functions, gradient-based attribution methods, conditional generative modeling, and adversarial training represents a fresh approach to the problem. The use of counterfactual examples specifically targeting identified spurious features is innovative, especially without requiring group annotations. However, many of the individual components (influence functions, integrated gradients, diffusion models, adversarial training) are well-established techniques in the literature. The proposal adapts and combines these methods in a new way rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks. The approach builds incrementally on existing work in counterfactual data augmentation and spurious correlation mitigation, as referenced in the literature review, rather than presenting a revolutionary new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for influence functions, integrated gradients, diffusion models, and training objectives are correctly presented and properly referenced. The three-stage approach (identification, generation, robust training) is logically structured and builds on established theoretical foundations. The loss functions are well-designed to address the specific challenges of spurious correlation mitigation. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The ablation studies are comprehensive and will help validate the contribution of each component. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) the approximation of influence functions may not scale well to very large models, (2) the assumption that spurious features can be cleanly separated from causal features may not always hold in practice, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of the theoretical guarantees or limitations of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a technically ambitious framework that faces several implementation challenges. While each individual component (influence functions, gradient attribution, generative modeling) has been demonstrated in the literature, integrating them into a cohesive system introduces significant complexity. The computational requirements for calculating influence functions on large models and datasets could be prohibitive. Training high-quality conditional generative models, especially for complex domains like medical imaging, is notoriously difficult and may require substantial computational resources and expertise. The proposal acknowledges some challenges but may underestimate the difficulty of generating realistic counterfactuals that modify only spurious features while preserving causal ones, particularly in domains where the distinction is subtle. The evaluation across three diverse domains (images, text, medical) adds another layer of implementation complexity. While the approach is theoretically implementable, practical constraints may necessitate significant simplifications or domain-specific adaptations to make it feasible within a reasonable timeframe and computational budget."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning: the tendency of models to exploit spurious correlations, leading to poor generalization in real-world settings. This issue has significant implications across high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, as highlighted in the introduction. The proposed ACA framework offers a promising approach to improving model robustness without requiring expensive group annotations, which could make robust training more accessible and practical. The expected outcomes include not only improved worst-group performance but also interpretability gains through the explicit identification of spurious features. The broader impacts section convincingly argues for the potential benefits in clinical applications, fairness, deployment reliability, and domain adaptation. The approach could significantly advance the field's ability to build reliable and generalizable models, particularly in domains where collecting comprehensive annotations is impractical. The proposal's significance is further enhanced by its potential to bridge theoretical advances in causal inference and adversarial training with practical applications in critical domains."
