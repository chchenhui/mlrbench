    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on spurious correlations in machine learning by proposing the Adversarial Counterfactual Augmentation (ACA) framework. The proposal covers all the key aspects mentioned in the task description, including examples of spurious correlations in medical imaging, NLP, and precision medicine. It follows the research idea closely, implementing the three-step approach of identifying spurious features, generating counterfactual examples, and retraining with consistency loss. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by addressing the identified challenges, particularly the need for methods that don't require group labels and can handle complex, unknown spurious features. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions several recent approaches (2023-2024), the proposal doesn't explicitly compare or contrast its approach with these specific methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the three-step methodology (spurious feature identification, counterfactual example generation, and model retraining) is logically presented with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, providing a clear roadmap for implementation and assessment. The proposal effectively communicates the problem of spurious correlations and how the ACA framework addresses it. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the specific criteria for determining which features are 'spurious' versus 'causal' could be more precisely defined, (2) the exact implementation details of the conditional generative models could be elaborated, and (3) the proposal could more clearly articulate how the approach differs from or improves upon existing methods mentioned in the literature review."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing techniques (influence functions, gradient-based attribution, generative models, and consistency loss) into a cohesive framework specifically designed to address spurious correlations without requiring group labels. The ACA framework offers a fresh perspective by using counterfactual examples to make models invariant to identified spurious features. While the individual components (influence functions, CycleGANs, diffusion models) are established techniques, their integration and application to the specific problem of spurious correlation robustness is innovative. However, the proposal shares some similarities with existing approaches in counterfactual data augmentation mentioned in the literature review, particularly the work on 'Counterfactual Data Augmentation Under Confounding.' The novelty lies more in the comprehensive framework and specific application rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on well-established theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for influence functions, gradient-based attribution methods, generative models, and consistency loss are correctly presented. The three-step methodology is logically coherent and well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The proposal demonstrates a good understanding of the underlying problem and existing approaches. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the proposal could more thoroughly address potential limitations of influence functions in identifying spurious features, especially in high-dimensional spaces, (2) the consistency loss formulation could be more specific about the type of loss function used (e.g., MSE, KL divergence), and (3) the proposal could provide more detailed theoretical analysis of why the approach is expected to work, perhaps with some formal guarantees or bounds."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The three main components (spurious feature identification, counterfactual generation, and model retraining) all use established techniques that have been demonstrated in the literature. The datasets mentioned (medical imaging, NLP, precision medicine) are available and appropriate for the research. However, there are several practical challenges that may require considerable effort: (1) training conditional generative models that can modify only spurious features while preserving true labels is complex and computationally intensive, especially for high-dimensional data like medical images, (2) accurately identifying spurious features without prior knowledge is challenging and may require domain expertise, and (3) the evaluation of the framework across multiple domains will require significant computational resources and time. While these challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, they do increase the implementation complexity and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning: the reliance on spurious correlations that leads to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. The ACA framework has significant potential impact across multiple domains, including medical imaging, NLP, and precision medicine, where spurious correlations can lead to biased or unreliable predictions. The framework's ability to operate without explicit group labels makes it particularly valuable for practical deployment in diverse and often unannotated datasets. If successful, the approach could significantly improve the robustness and fairness of machine learning models in critical applications. The proposal also contributes to the development of standardized evaluation metrics for assessing robustness against spurious correlations, which would benefit the broader research community. While the impact may not be transformative of the entire field, it addresses an important issue with clear practical implications and could lead to meaningful improvements in model reliability and fairness."
