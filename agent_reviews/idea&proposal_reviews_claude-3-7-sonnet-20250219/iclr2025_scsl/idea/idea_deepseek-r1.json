        "justification": "The AutoSpurious idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on spurious correlations and shortcut learning. It directly addresses one of the key objectives mentioned in the task description: developing automated methods for detecting spurious correlations. The proposal specifically targets the limitation of current benchmarks that rely on human-annotated group labels, which the workshop description explicitly identifies as 'not a scalable solution' that may 'overlook spurious correlations that do not align with human perceptions.' The idea of using model explainability tools to automatically identify and benchmark spurious correlations is highly relevant to the workshop's call for 'comprehensive evaluation benchmarks' and 'automated methods for detecting spurious correlations.' The multimodal aspect of the proposal also aligns with the workshop's interest in 'new datasets to evaluate the robustness of multi-modal models.'"

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated and understandable. It clearly outlines the problem (limitations of human-annotated group labels), the proposed solution (using model explainability tools to automatically detect spurious correlations), and the expected outcomes (scalable benchmarks and insights into model vulnerability). However, there are some ambiguities that could benefit from further elaboration. For instance, the specific explainability tools to be used are only vaguely mentioned ('feature attribution, attention maps'), and the exact methodology for identifying which features are 'disproportionately influencing predictions' is not fully detailed. The process of creating 'stress tests' by perturbing or masking features could also be more precisely defined. While the overall framework is clear, these technical details would need refinement for complete clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong originality by proposing an automated approach to a problem that has traditionally relied on manual human annotation. The concept of leveraging model explainability tools to automatically detect spurious correlations represents a fresh perspective on the problem. The cross-modal feature interaction analysis for multimodal data is particularly innovative, as it addresses subtle spurious links that might be missed by conventional approaches. While some components of the proposal build on existing work in model explainability and robustness testing, the integration of these components into an automated framework for spurious correlation detection and benchmarking appears to be novel. The application to various modalities and model types (LLMs, LMMs, RL agents) further enhances its innovative nature. The approach isn't entirely unprecedented, but it offers a significant advancement over current methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Model explainability tools exist and could be leveraged for this purpose, but automatically distinguishing between spurious correlations and legitimate patterns is a complex task that may require sophisticated algorithms and validation methods. The proposal to perturb or mask features to create stress tests is technically feasible, but ensuring these perturbations target only spurious features without affecting legitimate ones could be challenging. For multimodal data, analyzing cross-modal feature interactions adds another layer of complexity. The scalability claim is promising but would require efficient computational methods to be practical for large datasets. Additionally, validating that the automatically detected spurious correlations are indeed spurious (without human verification) presents a circular challenge. While the core components are implementable with current technology, considerable refinement and validation would be needed to make the framework reliable and effective."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposed research addresses a critical problem in AI robustness and evaluation. If successful, an automated method for detecting and benchmarking spurious correlations would significantly advance the field by enabling more comprehensive and scalable evaluation of model robustness. This is particularly important as AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes real-world applications where reliance on spurious correlations can lead to harmful outcomes. The ability to identify unknown or non-human-aligned biases would be especially valuable, as these are currently difficult to detect and mitigate. The framework's applicability across different modalities and model types (LLMs, LMMs, RL agents) enhances its potential impact. By providing insights into model vulnerability without requiring extensive human annotation, the research could accelerate progress in developing more robust AI systems and contribute to safer, more reliable AI deployment."
