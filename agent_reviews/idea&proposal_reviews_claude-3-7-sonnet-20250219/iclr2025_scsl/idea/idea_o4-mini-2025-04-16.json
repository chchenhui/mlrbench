        "justification": "The AIFS idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on spurious correlations and shortcut learning. It directly addresses the core challenge of models latching onto spurious cues, which is central to the workshop's theme. The proposal specifically targets the scenario where 'group labels or annotator guidance are unavailable,' which matches the workshop's concern about the limitations of current benchmarks that rely on known group labels. The approach is modality-agnostic, making it relevant to the workshop's interest in various data types. The idea also focuses on discovering causal patterns rather than spurious correlations, which aligns with the workshop's objective of developing robust models that understand underlying causal relationships."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure that explains the motivation, approach, and expected outcomes. The technical components are described with sufficient detail - including the pretrained encoder, intervention module, dual-objective loss, and gradient-based attribution for identifying sensitive latent directions. The iterative process of the approach is clearly explained. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific implementation details of the 'style' perturbations and how exactly the sensitivity loss is calculated. The evaluation plan is mentioned but lacks specifics about which benchmarks will be used and how performance will be measured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The AIFS approach offers a fresh perspective by combining several existing concepts in a new way. The idea of using synthetic interventions to discover and neutralize spurious factors without requiring explicit group labels is innovative. The integration of a generative intervention loop with gradient-based attribution to identify sensitive latent directions represents a novel approach to the problem. However, the core components draw from existing work in adversarial training, disentangled representations, and invariant risk minimization. The approach builds upon rather than fundamentally reimagines these techniques. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and application to the spurious correlation problem than in introducing entirely new algorithmic concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach appears technically feasible with current deep learning methods and computational resources. It builds on established techniques like latent space manipulations and adversarial training. The modular design (pretrained encoder + intervention module) is practical and allows for flexible implementation across different architectures. However, there are some implementation challenges that might affect feasibility: (1) effectively learning which latent dimensions correspond to spurious features without supervision could be difficult, (2) balancing the dual objectives of invariance and sensitivity might require careful tuning, and (3) ensuring that the interventions actually simulate realistic distributional shifts rather than creating unrealistic examples could be challenging. These concerns don't make the approach infeasible, but they do suggest that considerable experimentation and refinement would be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is high as it addresses a fundamental challenge in machine learning: building models that focus on causal rather than spurious patterns without requiring explicit supervision about what features are spurious. If successful, this approach could have broad impact across multiple domains and modalities, as claimed. The modality-agnostic nature of the approach increases its potential significance. The method could be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous systems where robustness to distribution shifts is critical. The approach also contributes to the theoretical understanding of how models learn invariant features, which aligns with the workshop's interest in exploring the foundations of spurious correlations. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that similar goals are being pursued by other approaches in the field, but the specific technical approach here offers a valuable contribution."
