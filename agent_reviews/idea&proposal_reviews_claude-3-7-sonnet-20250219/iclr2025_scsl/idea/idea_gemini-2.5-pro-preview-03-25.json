        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on spurious correlations and shortcut learning. It directly addresses the workshop's call for 'finding solutions for robustness to spurious correlation when information regarding spurious feature is completely or partially unknown' and 'proposing new robustification methods.' The idea specifically targets foundation models (LLMs/LMMs), which the workshop explicitly mentions as an area of interest. The proposed probe-and-correct framework addresses the challenge of unknown spurious correlations without requiring predefined spurious labels, which matches the workshop's objective of developing methods that don't rely on human annotation of groups. The only minor limitation in alignment is that it doesn't explicitly address some of the foundational aspects of spurious correlations that the workshop also seeks to explore."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (unknown spurious correlations in foundation models), the proposed solution (a probe-and-correct framework), and the expected outcome (enhanced model robustness). The three-step approach (identify influential features, generate counterfactual inputs, fine-tune with targeted regularization) is well-structured and logical. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific post-hoc explanation methods to be used, how the clustering of influential features would be implemented technically, and details about the regularization term or contrastive loss function. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving the highest clarity score, but overall, the idea is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to handling unknown spurious correlations in foundation models. The combination of post-hoc explanation methods with automatic clustering to hypothesize potential shortcuts, followed by counterfactual generation and targeted fine-tuning, represents a fresh integration of existing techniques for a specific purpose. The proactive approach to robustification without predefined spurious labels is particularly innovative. However, each individual component (explanation methods, counterfactual generation, regularization) builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. The novelty lies more in the integration and application to the specific problem of unknown spurious correlations in foundation models, rather than in developing entirely new algorithmic approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. On the positive side, it leverages existing techniques (explanation methods, counterfactual generation, fine-tuning) that have established implementations. However, several significant challenges exist: (1) Applying influence functions to foundation models is computationally expensive and may not scale well; (2) Automatically clustering influential features to identify potential shortcuts without human guidance is non-trivial and may produce false positives; (3) Generating minimally modified counterfactuals that alter only spurious features while preserving core concepts requires sophisticated understanding of semantics; (4) The effectiveness of the regularization approach depends on correctly identifying the spurious correlations in the first place. These challenges don't make the idea impractical, but they do suggest considerable effort would be needed to implement it successfully, particularly for very large foundation models."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in AI: the robustness of foundation models against unknown spurious correlations. This is highly significant because: (1) Foundation models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications where reliability is crucial; (2) The approach tackles the practical reality that we cannot identify all potential spurious attributes beforehand; (3) If successful, it could significantly improve model generalization to real-world scenarios; (4) The method could enhance trustworthiness of AI systems by reducing unexpected failures due to reliance on spurious features. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the approach may not completely eliminate all forms of spurious correlations, and its effectiveness might vary across different domains and model architectures. Nevertheless, even incremental improvements in this area would represent an important contribution to the field."
