    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on spurious correlations and shortcut learning by proposing AIFS, a framework that discovers and neutralizes hidden spurious factors without requiring group labels. The methodology section thoroughly elaborates on the approach outlined in the research idea, including the generative intervention loop, latent perturbations, and dual-objective loss. The proposal also connects well with the literature review by positioning itself as addressing key challenges identified, particularly 'Identifying Spurious Features Without Supervision' and offering a solution that works across modalities. The experimental design includes relevant benchmarks mentioned in the task description (like Waterbirds and CelebA) and compares against appropriate baselines from the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical formulations are precise and well-defined, with appropriate mathematical notation and pseudocode that enhances understanding. The objectives, methods, and rationales are articulated concisely with minimal ambiguity. The experimental design is comprehensive, detailing datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few minor areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the relationship between the mask matrix M and the sensitivity-based dimension selection could be more explicitly connected, (2) the exact mechanism for updating M based on sensitivity could be more detailed, and (3) some technical parameters like η in the pseudocode are introduced without prior definition. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The core innovation lies in the adaptive intervention mechanism that automatically discovers spurious latent factors via gradient-based attribution and applies synthetic interventions in the latent space. This approach differs from prior work by eliminating the need for explicit group labels or manual annotation of spurious features. The dual-objective training procedure with both invariance and sensitivity losses is also a fresh perspective. However, the proposal shares conceptual similarities with existing approaches in the literature review, such as ElRep's representation regularization and SPUME's meta-learning framework. The gradient-based attribution for identifying important features is also a well-established technique. While AIFS integrates these concepts in a novel way and extends them to the latent space, it represents an evolution rather than a revolutionary approach to addressing spurious correlations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for the intervention module, invariance loss, and sensitivity loss are well-defined and logically consistent. The approach draws from established principles in causal representation learning and invariant risk minimization, as referenced in the literature review. The iterative attribution-intervention loop is well-justified as a mechanism to progressively identify and neutralize spurious correlations. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are thoughtfully designed to validate key components of the approach. There are, however, a few areas that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the theoretical guarantees that the approach will converge to truly causal features rather than simply different spurious ones, (2) the relationship between the sensitivity measure and actual spuriousness of features, and (3) the optimal balance between the loss components. Despite these minor concerns, the overall approach is rigorous and well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The implementation builds on standard deep learning architectures (ResNet-50, MLPs) and optimization techniques (Adam). The computational requirements seem reasonable, with the authors estimating only a 10-20% overhead compared to standard ERM training. The datasets chosen (Colored MNIST, Waterbirds, CelebA) are well-established benchmarks with available implementations. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional effort: (1) the gradient-based attribution and mask updating mechanism may require careful tuning to ensure stability and effectiveness, (2) the hyperparameter space is quite large (α, β, k, m, σ) and finding optimal values could be time-consuming, (3) extending to modalities beyond vision (particularly text via BERT embeddings) may present additional challenges not fully addressed in the methodology. The proposal acknowledges these challenges and includes ablation studies to address them, suggesting the authors have considered implementation difficulties."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning: the reliance on spurious correlations that undermines model robustness and fairness. If successful, AIFS would provide a significant contribution by enabling the discovery and mitigation of spurious correlations without requiring group annotations or manual identification of biases. This would be particularly valuable for real-world applications where such annotations are unavailable or impractical to obtain. The expected outcomes include substantial improvements in worst-group accuracy (5-10 percentage points) and reduced robustness gaps, which would represent meaningful progress in the field. The approach is also modality-agnostic, potentially impacting a wide range of applications from computer vision to natural language processing and tabular data analysis. The societal impact is well-articulated, highlighting applications in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance where fairness and reliability are crucial. The methodological contribution of the attribution-intervention loop could inspire future work in related areas. While not completely transformative of the field, AIFS represents a significant step forward in addressing an important problem with broad implications."
