        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment. It directly addresses the workshop's core challenge of moving beyond static, unidirectional alignment to capture 'dynamic, complicated, and evolving interactions between humans and AI systems.' The proposal incorporates both directions emphasized in the task: aligning AI with humans (through online RL with human feedback) and aligning humans with AI (through interpretable explanations that foster user awareness and control). The idea fits within multiple workshop topics, including methods (RL with human feedback), evaluation (longitudinal user studies), and deployment (customizable alignment). The only minor gap is that it could more explicitly address societal impact considerations beyond the brief mention of applications in health, education, and ethical AI deployment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured with clear sections for motivation, main idea, and implementation approach. The core concept of 'real-time, bidirectional alignment' is defined precisely, and the technical approach combining online RL with interpretable feedback loops is explained concisely. The proposal outlines specific mechanisms (multimodal feedback, explanations of AI decisions) and evaluation methods (longitudinal user studies in specific domains). However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as how the hybrid RL-imitation learning architecture will specifically balance adaptation with retention of prior alignment objectives, and how the system will distinguish between different types of user feedback (corrections vs. preferences vs. behavioral cues). These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong originality by reconceptualizing alignment as a dynamic, bidirectional process rather than a static, one-way training procedure. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an established approach, the proposal innovates by: (1) moving RLHF from offline training to online, real-time adaptation; (2) incorporating multimodal feedback beyond explicit preferences; (3) addressing non-stationarity through a hybrid architecture; and (4) creating a closed-loop system where explanations help users provide better feedback. The combination of these elements represents a novel approach to alignment. However, each individual component (online RL, interpretability, imitation learning) builds upon existing research directions rather than introducing fundamentally new technical paradigms, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces several implementation challenges that affect its feasibility. Real-time adaptation from human feedback introduces significant technical hurdles, including: (1) ensuring sample efficiency with limited real-time feedback; (2) preventing catastrophic forgetting or policy degradation during online updates; (3) developing robust interpretability mechanisms that work across diverse domains; and (4) designing effective user interfaces for multimodal feedback collection without overwhelming users. The proposed longitudinal studies would require substantial resources and time. While the individual components (RL, interpretability, user studies) are established research areas with existing methods, their integration into a cohesive, real-time bidirectional system represents a considerable engineering and research challenge. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but doesn't detail specific solutions, suggesting moderate feasibility that would require significant research effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research addresses a critical gap in current alignment approaches by tackling the dynamic nature of human-AI interaction. If successful, this work could significantly advance the field by: (1) establishing a new paradigm for continuous alignment that better reflects real-world human-AI relationships; (2) providing practical mechanisms for AI systems to adapt to evolving user needs without requiring retraining; (3) empowering users with greater agency in shaping AI behavior through transparent feedback loops; and (4) potentially improving trust and adoption of AI systems across critical domains like healthcare and education. The bidirectional approach directly addresses the workshop's call for more comprehensive alignment frameworks. The impact would extend beyond theoretical contributions to practical applications in multiple domains, potentially influencing how alignment is conceptualized and implemented in future AI systems."
