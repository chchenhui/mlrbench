        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Co-Steer idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment. It directly addresses the workshop's core challenge of moving beyond static, unidirectional alignment to capture 'dynamic, complicated, and evolving interactions between humans and AI systems.' The proposal incorporates both alignment directions: 'AI aligned to Human' (through real-time feedback mechanisms) and 'Human aligned to AI' (through interfaces that help users understand AI capabilities). The idea fits perfectly within multiple workshop topics, including Methods (interaction mechanisms), Deployment (steerability), and Evaluation (user studies measuring alignment). The only minor limitation is that it could more explicitly address societal impact considerations mentioned in the workshop scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The Co-Steer idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation clearly establishes the problem (static alignment failing to capture dynamic needs). The main idea articulates a concrete solution with specific examples of implementation (sliders for competing values, natural language critiques, selection/editing of responses). The evaluation approach is well-defined with specific metrics (task performance, perceived alignment, user control, cognitive load). The only aspects that could benefit from further elaboration are the technical details of how the 'continuous, nuanced feedback dynamically updates the AI's internal alignment model' - the mention of 'online RLHF variants or contextual preference learning' provides direction but remains somewhat general."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The Co-Steer idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to real-time bidirectional alignment. While individual components like preference sliders or feedback mechanisms exist in various systems, the integration into a comprehensive framework specifically for dynamic alignment negotiation represents a fresh perspective. The concept of treating alignment as an ongoing negotiation rather than a fixed property is innovative. However, the idea builds significantly on existing work in interactive AI systems, RLHF, and preference learning rather than introducing fundamentally new technical approaches. The novelty lies more in the framing and integration of these techniques specifically for bidirectional alignment rather than in the underlying mechanisms themselves."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The Co-Steer idea demonstrates strong feasibility. The proposed interface elements (sliders, natural language critiques, selection/editing) are all technically implementable with current technology. The suggested approaches for updating the AI's internal model (online RLHF variants or contextual preference learning) are established techniques that could be adapted to this context. The evaluation methodology through user studies is standard practice. The main implementation challenges would likely involve: (1) ensuring the real-time updates to the AI's internal model are computationally efficient enough for interactive use, (2) designing an interface that balances expressiveness with usability, and (3) developing metrics that accurately capture the quality of alignment. These challenges are substantial but surmountable with current technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The Co-Steer idea addresses a significant problem in AI alignment. Moving beyond static, pre-deployment alignment to dynamic, interactive alignment could substantially improve AI systems' ability to adapt to individual users' needs and changing contexts. This approach could help resolve the tension between general-purpose AI systems and personalized use cases. The potential impact extends to multiple domains where AI assistants interact with humans, potentially improving trust, satisfaction, and effectiveness. The significance is particularly high given the growing deployment of large language models in diverse contexts with varying user needs. The idea also contributes to the theoretical understanding of alignment as a bidirectional, negotiated process rather than a fixed property, which could influence future research directions in the field."
