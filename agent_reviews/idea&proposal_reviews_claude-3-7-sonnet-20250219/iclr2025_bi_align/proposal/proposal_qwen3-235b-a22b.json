    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment by developing a framework that enables real-time co-adaptation between humans and AI systems. The proposal incorporates both directions emphasized in the task: 'Aligning AI with Humans' through online RL and feedback mechanisms, and 'Aligning Humans with AI' through explanation generation and user empowerment. The methodology builds upon the cited literature, particularly leveraging concepts from SHARPIE (Aydın et al., 2025), RL-SaLLM-F (Tu et al., 2024), and strategyproof RLHF (Kleine Buening et al., 2025). The proposal also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as dynamic human preferences, non-stationarity, and the need for interpretability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the framework architecture is well-defined with four interconnected modules. The technical details, including the hybrid RL-imitation learning approach and the mathematical formulations, are presented with precision. The experimental design outlines specific domains, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for balancing the dynamic weighting factor α could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the counterfactual explanations and user trust could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'KTO', 'RLAIF') are used without full explanation, assuming familiarity with the literature."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in its approach to bidirectional human-AI alignment. The integration of online reinforcement learning with interpretable feedback loops for continuous co-adaptation represents a fresh perspective on alignment. The hybrid RL-imitation learning architecture to balance adaptation with retention of prior alignment is innovative, as is the focus on generating context-specific explanations to clarify how feedback influences AI decisions. However, many of the individual components (PPO, counterfactual explanations, multimodal feedback) are established techniques being combined in a new way rather than fundamentally new methods. The proposal builds incrementally on existing work like SHARPIE and RL-SaLLM-F rather than introducing entirely novel algorithms. While the combination and application to bidirectional alignment is innovative, the technical novelty of individual components is moderate."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The hybrid RL-imitation learning approach is well-formulated mathematically, with clear objectives and loss functions. The use of PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) as the base RL algorithm is appropriate given its stability properties. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (Static RLHF, RLAIF, KTO) and a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics covering both technical performance and human factors. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges like reward hacking and includes metrics to detect such issues. The counterfactual explanation approach is theoretically sound for helping users understand policy changes. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions theoretical guarantees on convergence under non-stationary feedback, it doesn't fully elaborate on these guarantees or their conditions. Additionally, more details on how the system handles potentially contradictory feedback from different users would strengthen the technical soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components and implementation steps. The use of established frameworks like SHARPIE and well-understood algorithms like PPO increases practicality. The experimental domains (collaborative robotics, personalized recommendations) are appropriate for testing bidirectional alignment. The evaluation protocol, including simulated environments followed by longitudinal user studies, is well-structured and achievable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) collecting and processing multimodal feedback in real-time could be technically complex, (2) the longitudinal study with 100 participants over 4 weeks represents a substantial resource commitment, (3) generating meaningful counterfactual explanations that non-expert users can understand is challenging, and (4) balancing adaptation speed with policy stability in non-stationary environments remains an open research problem. While these challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, they do increase the implementation complexity and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI alignment - the dynamic, bidirectional nature of human-AI interaction - which has significant implications for the development of trustworthy, adaptable AI systems. The expected contributions (framework architecture, hybrid algorithm, explainability toolkit) would advance the field of bidirectional alignment in meaningful ways. The potential applications in healthcare (adaptive clinical decision-support), education (tutoring systems), and ethical AI deployment address important societal needs. The focus on both technical performance and human factors (trust, usability) ensures a holistic approach to alignment. The proposal directly advances the workshop's goals of broadening understanding of AI alignment and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. While the impact may not be immediately transformative of the entire field, it represents a significant step forward in addressing a fundamental limitation of current alignment approaches and could influence how future AI systems are designed to maintain alignment over time."
