    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment by developing a framework that combines both AI-centered learning (through online RL) and human-centered transparency (through interpretable feedback loops). The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including SHARPIE's modular approach to human-AI interaction, online preference-based RL techniques from Tu et al., and PPO algorithms as documented in the literature. The research objectives clearly target the challenges identified in both the task description and literature review, particularly the inadequacy of unidirectional alignment approaches in dynamic, evolving interactions. The methodology section thoroughly details how the proposed framework will enable continuous co-adaptation through multimodal feedback integration and explanation generation, directly addressing the bidirectional alignment paradigm outlined in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is presented in a logical progression, with detailed explanations of each component (Feedback Integration Module, Hybrid Learning Module, Explanation Generation Module). Mathematical formulations are precisely defined and accompanied by explanatory text. The pseudocode provides a clear implementation guide. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for determining when to add experiences to the IL buffer could be more precisely defined beyond the threshold τ_pos, (2) the explanation generation section could provide more concrete examples of the template-based explanations, and (3) the relationship between the gradient attribution scores and the natural language explanations could be more thoroughly explained. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers significant novelty in several aspects. The hybrid RL-IL architecture for continuous adaptation under non-stationary preferences represents a fresh approach to addressing the dynamic nature of human-AI alignment. While individual components like PPO and imitation learning are established techniques, their integration with multimodal feedback and explanation generation in a unified framework is innovative. The proposal's approach to combining explicit and implicit feedback signals into a unified reward-shaping mechanism extends beyond current methods in the literature. The explanation generation module that quantifies the influence of specific feedback on policy updates is particularly novel, as it creates a transparent feedback loop that empowers users to understand and guide AI behavior. While building on existing work like SHARPIE and online preference-based RL, the proposal introduces original elements that advance the state of the art in bidirectional alignment. The focus on non-stationarity and catastrophic forgetting in the context of human preference alignment is also a distinctive contribution."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The use of PPO as the base RL algorithm is appropriate given its stability and effectiveness in policy optimization tasks. The mathematical formulations for the hybrid learning approach, combining PPO with imitation learning, are technically correct and well-justified. The gradient-based explanation generation approach has a solid theoretical foundation. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical analysis plans. However, there are a few areas where additional rigor could strengthen the proposal: (1) the stability of the hybrid learning approach under extreme preference shifts could be more thoroughly analyzed, (2) the potential biases in the natural language encoding of corrections could be addressed more explicitly, and (3) the hyperparameter sensitivity (particularly for α, β, γ, and λ) could be more comprehensively discussed. Despite these minor limitations, the overall technical approach is sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and implementation steps. The use of established algorithms like PPO and imitation learning increases practical viability. The experimental domains (collaborative robotics and personalized recommendation) are appropriate for evaluating the framework. However, several challenges may affect implementation: (1) The real-time nature of the framework requires efficient computation for timely feedback processing and policy updates, which may be challenging in complex environments. (2) The longitudinal human studies with 60 participants per domain represent a significant recruitment and management effort. (3) Capturing and processing multimodal feedback (especially implicit cues) in real-time introduces technical complexity. (4) The explanation generation module needs to balance informativeness with conciseness, which may require substantial iteration. While these challenges are not insurmountable, they do increase the implementation complexity. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of potential computational requirements and strategies for managing the human studies efficiently. Overall, the research is feasible but with moderate implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment research: the need for dynamic, bidirectional adaptation in human-AI systems. This work has significant potential impact across multiple dimensions. Theoretically, it advances our understanding of non-stationary preference alignment and provides a mathematical framework for integrating multimodal feedback. Practically, the framework could substantially improve human-AI collaboration in domains like healthcare, education, and autonomous systems by enabling AI systems to adapt to evolving user needs while maintaining alignment with core values. The focus on interpretable explanations directly addresses the human-centered perspective of alignment emphasized in the workshop description. The potential to establish standards for dynamic alignment research that bridges ML, HCI, and social sciences aligns perfectly with the workshop's interdisciplinary goals. The proposal's outcomes could influence both academic research directions and industry practices in responsible AI deployment. The longitudinal evaluation approach will provide valuable empirical insights into the dynamics of human-AI co-adaptation that extend beyond the specific technical contributions."
