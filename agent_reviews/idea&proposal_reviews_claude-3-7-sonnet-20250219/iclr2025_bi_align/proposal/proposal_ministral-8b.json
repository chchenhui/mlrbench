        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bidirectional human-AI alignment by proposing a framework that combines online reinforcement learning with interpretable human feedback loops. The proposal acknowledges the limitations of traditional unidirectional alignment approaches and emphasizes the dynamic, evolving nature of human-AI interactions, which is central to the workshop's goals. The methodology incorporates both AI-centered and human-centered perspectives as outlined in the task description. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by addressing challenges like non-stationarity, real-time adaptation, and the need for interpretable explanations. The technical approach involving RL-imitation learning hybrid architecture is well-grounded in the cited literature on RLHF and PPO."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the research design, data collection methods, algorithmic steps, and evaluation metrics. The mathematical formulations for Q-learning, imitation learning, and explanation generation are precisely defined. The experimental design is outlined in a step-by-step manner, making it easy to follow. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as the specific mechanisms for integrating multimodal feedback and how the system will balance adaptation to new data with retention of prior alignment objectives. Additionally, while the proposal mentions longitudinal user studies, it could provide more details on the specific tasks and scenarios that will be used to evaluate the framework."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a fresh perspective on AI alignment by emphasizing real-time, bidirectional adaptation between humans and AI systems. The combination of online reinforcement learning with interpretable human feedback loops for continuous co-adaptation represents a novel approach to addressing the dynamic nature of human-AI interactions. The hybrid RL-imitation learning architecture for balancing adaptation with retention of prior alignment objectives is also innovative. However, many of the individual components (RL, imitation learning, human feedback, explanations) have been explored in prior work, as evidenced by the literature review. The novelty lies primarily in the integration of these components into a cohesive framework for dynamic co-adaptation rather than in the development of fundamentally new algorithms or techniques. The proposal builds incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing a completely new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The algorithmic steps are well-defined, with clear mathematical formulations for the Q-learning update rule, imitation learning component, and explanation generation mechanism. The research design follows a logical progression from system initialization to longitudinal evaluation. The evaluation metrics (alignment persistence, user trust, system adaptability) are appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The proposal also acknowledges the challenge of non-stationarity in human-AI interactions and proposes a hybrid RL-imitation learning architecture to address it. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further theoretical justification, such as the specific choice of causal reasoning approach for explanation generation and how the system will handle potentially conflicting feedback from multiple users. Additionally, while the proposal mentions the use of multimodal feedback, it does not fully elaborate on how different types of feedback will be weighted or integrated."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible approach to dynamic human-AI co-adaptation. The use of established techniques like Q-learning and imitation learning increases the practicality of implementation. The experimental design is reasonable, involving system initialization, user interaction, policy updates, explanation generation, and longitudinal evaluation. The evaluation metrics are measurable and relevant to the research objectives. However, there are several implementation challenges that may affect feasibility. Collecting high-quality multimodal feedback in real-time could be resource-intensive and technically complex. The longitudinal user studies will require significant time and participant commitment. The hybrid RL-imitation learning architecture, while theoretically sound, may face challenges in balancing adaptation with retention of prior alignment objectives in practice. Additionally, generating human-centric explanations that are both accurate and understandable in real-time is a non-trivial task. While these challenges do not render the proposal infeasible, they do increase the implementation complexity and may require additional resources or methodological refinements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment approaches by focusing on the dynamic, bidirectional nature of human-AI interactions. If successful, the research could establish a blueprint for resilient, context-aware bidirectional alignment frameworks with applications in health, education, and ethical AI deployment. The emphasis on empowering users to actively shape AI behavior while enabling AI systems to adapt to evolving human needs has the potential to enhance user trust and engagement with AI systems. The proposed framework could contribute significantly to the broader understanding and development of AI alignment techniques, particularly in dynamic and evolving interaction scenarios. The research also has implications for policy and practice in AI development and deployment, potentially influencing the creation of an inclusive human-AI alignment ecosystem. While the immediate impact may be limited to specific application domains, the long-term significance for advancing bidirectional human-AI alignment is substantial."
