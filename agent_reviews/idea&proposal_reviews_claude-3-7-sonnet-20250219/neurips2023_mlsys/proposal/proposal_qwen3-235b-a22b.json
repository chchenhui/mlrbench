        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'applying ML to compute sustainability' and 'energy/carbon optimization' as mentioned in the task description. The proposal elaborates comprehensively on the initial idea of using DRL for energy-carbon-aware scheduling, maintaining the core concepts while adding technical depth. It also builds upon the literature review by acknowledging and addressing limitations in existing works like CarbonClipper, PCAPS, and CarbonScaler, and proposes solutions that go beyond these approaches. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the state representation, action space, and reward signal, and expands them with mathematical formulations and implementation details."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The problem statement, objectives, and significance are explicitly defined. The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations for the MDP framework, including state space, action space, and reward function. The implementation approach is described with specific technical details about the DRL architecture, training protocol, and deployment strategy. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more details on how the system handles the trade-offs between energy cost, carbon emissions, and SLA compliance in practice, and how the weights in the reward function (α=1.0, β=0.8, γ=0.2) were determined beyond mentioning 'sensitivity analysis'."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining multiple control levers (job scheduling, power capping, and VM migration) into a unified DRL framework for energy-carbon-aware scheduling. This multi-action approach distinguishes it from existing solutions like CarbonClipper and PCAPS, which use online optimization but lack adaptability, and CarbonScaler, which focuses on resource allocation but ignores other control levers. The integration of spatiotemporal carbon awareness with hardware-level controls is innovative. However, the core techniques used (PPO algorithm, reward shaping, curriculum learning) are established methods in reinforcement learning rather than novel algorithmic contributions. The proposal builds incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts, which limits its novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The MDP formulation is mathematically sound, with well-defined state and action spaces, and a reasonable reward function that balances multiple objectives. The DRL implementation details are comprehensive, including network architecture, training protocol, and hyperparameters. The evaluation methodology is robust, with clearly defined metrics and baselines for comparison. The simulator design incorporates real-world datasets for workloads, energy prices, and carbon intensity, enhancing the validity of the results. The proposal also includes validation against Kubernetes cluster benchmarks. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened, such as more detailed justification for the chosen DRL algorithm (PPO) over alternatives, and more rigorous analysis of the potential limitations or failure modes of the approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible implementation plan with a clear phased approach. The use of existing tools like CloudSim and Kubernetes for the simulator and deployment environment increases practicality. The data requirements (workload traces, energy prices, carbon intensity) are reasonable and based on publicly available datasets. The computational resources needed for training (512 distributed actors) are substantial but within reach for academic or industry research. The integration with Kubernetes through a scheduler extender API is a practical approach for real-world deployment. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) the complexity of coordinating multiple control actions (scheduling, power capping, migration) in real-time, (2) potential overhead of the DRL inference in production environments, and (3) the challenge of accurately modeling power consumption and carbon emissions in heterogeneous hardware environments. These challenges are acknowledged but could require significant engineering effort to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem with substantial environmental and economic impact. Cloud datacenters consume approximately 2% of global electricity and contribute 1% of total CO₂ emissions, making energy-carbon-aware scheduling an important area for improvement. The potential outcomes are significant: 20-30% lower energy costs, 35-45% reduced carbon emissions, with minimal latency overhead. For large-scale deployments, this could translate to thousands of metric tons of CO₂ reduction and millions in cost savings annually. The proposal also contributes to the scientific community through the release of an open-source framework and datasets, promoting reproducibility and further research. The work aligns well with the ML for Systems workshop's focus on sustainability and benchmarks. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on a specific application domain (cloud scheduling) rather than addressing broader systems challenges or establishing generalizable principles for ML in systems."
