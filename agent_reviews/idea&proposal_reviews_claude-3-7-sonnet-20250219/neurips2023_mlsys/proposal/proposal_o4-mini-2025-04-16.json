    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on ML for systems, particularly in the area of 'applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization' through energy-aware job scheduling. The proposal builds upon the literature review by acknowledging and extending existing carbon-aware scheduling approaches (CarbonClipper, PCAPS, CarbonScaler) while leveraging deep reinforcement learning to overcome their limitations. The methodology section clearly demonstrates how the proposal addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as balancing performance and sustainability, adapting to dynamic energy markets, and handling workload dependencies. The proposal maintains consistency with the original research idea while elaborating it into a comprehensive research plan."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The problem formulation is precisely defined using mathematical notation for the MDP framework, with clear definitions of state space, action space, transition function, and reward function. The DRL architecture is well-explained with specific details about network architecture, training approach (PPO), and loss functions. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying baselines, metrics, and scenarios. The only minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more details on how the simulator will be validated against real-world conditions, and (2) further elaboration on the off-policy correction mechanism for fine-tuning. Overall, the proposal is highly understandable with logical flow and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by applying deep reinforcement learning to carbon-aware scheduling, which differentiates it from existing approaches that rely on convex optimization or heuristics. The integration of multiple objectives (energy cost, carbon emissions, and SLA violations) into a unified DRL framework is innovative. The proposal also introduces novel elements such as power-cap adjustments and VM migrations as part of the action space, which extends beyond simple job placement decisions. However, the core concept of carbon-aware scheduling itself is not entirely new, as evidenced by the cited works (CarbonClipper, PCAPS, CarbonScaler). The novelty lies more in the approach (DRL) and comprehensive integration of multiple factors rather than in the fundamental problem being addressed. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more groundbreaking conceptual innovations beyond the application of DRL to this domain."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor in its formulation and methodology. The MDP formulation is mathematically precise and appropriate for the problem domain. The choice of PPO as the reinforcement learning algorithm is well-justified given its stability and effectiveness in similar control problems. The reward function design thoughtfully balances multiple objectives with tunable parameters. The simulator design incorporates real-world data sources (Google cluster trace, Microsoft Azure logs, ERCOT/CAISO market data), enhancing the validity of the approach. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics for evaluation. The proposal also acknowledges practical considerations like decision latency and scalability. The only minor limitations in soundness are: (1) limited discussion of potential failure modes or edge cases in the DRL approach, and (2) the absence of theoretical guarantees on performance or convergence, which are provided in some of the baseline approaches like CarbonClipper."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with a clear path to implementation. The use of a simulator before deployment to a real Kubernetes testbed is a practical approach that reduces risks. The data sources for workload traces, electricity prices, and carbon intensity are readily available. The computational requirements for training the DRL model appear reasonable. The proposal includes concrete metrics and baselines for evaluation. However, there are some implementation challenges that affect the feasibility score: (1) the complexity of building a high-fidelity simulator that accurately captures all relevant dynamics, (2) the challenge of fine-tuning policies trained in simulation to work effectively in real environments, (3) the potential scalability issues when deploying to large clusters with thousands of nodes as mentioned in the objectives, and (4) the integration challenges with existing Kubernetes schedulers. While these challenges are acknowledged to some extent, they represent non-trivial engineering efforts that could impact the timeline and success of the project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem with substantial real-world impact. Reducing energy costs and carbon emissions in cloud datacenters directly contributes to sustainability goals while potentially saving operational costs. The expected outcomes of 15-30% reduction in energy expenditure and 20-40% lower COâ‚‚ emissions represent meaningful improvements over existing approaches. The commitment to release an open-source framework enhances the significance by enabling reproducibility and further research. The proposal also has broader impacts for cloud providers, grid operators, and policymakers. The significance is particularly high given the growing energy demands of AI workloads and increasing focus on sustainable computing. The proposal could have scored higher if it had more explicitly quantified the global impact (e.g., total potential carbon reduction if widely adopted) or demonstrated more transformative potential beyond the incremental improvements over existing methods."
