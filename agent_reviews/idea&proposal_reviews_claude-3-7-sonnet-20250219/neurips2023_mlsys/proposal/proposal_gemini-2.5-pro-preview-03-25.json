    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'applying ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization' and specifically targets 'energy-aware job scheduling' as mentioned in the task description. The proposal elaborates comprehensively on the brief idea of GreenSched, maintaining the core concept of using DRL for energy-carbon-aware scheduling while providing detailed specifications for the state representation, action space, and reward signal as outlined in the idea. The proposal also thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, including balancing performance with sustainability (through its multi-objective reward function), adapting to dynamic energy markets (by incorporating real-time pricing and carbon intensity data), handling workload dependencies (in its state representation), scaling RL solutions (through simulation-based pre-training), and integration with existing infrastructure (via Kubernetes testbed validation)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The MDP formulation is particularly well-defined, with precise mathematical descriptions of the state space, action space, transition probability, and reward function. The experimental design is thoroughly explained with specific baselines, scenarios, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating with Kubernetes could be more detailed, (2) the specific neural network architectures for the actor and critic could be more precisely defined, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly address how it will handle the sim-to-real gap when transferring the trained policy to the real system. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. It extends beyond existing work by integrating multiple factors (energy pricing, carbon intensity, workload characteristics, and power management) into a unified DRL framework, which is more comprehensive than most approaches in the literature review. The inclusion of power management actions (CPU/GPU power capping) alongside traditional scheduling decisions is innovative. However, the core concept of using RL for carbon-aware scheduling has been explored in prior work like the cited 'Sustainable AIGC Workload Scheduling' paper, and some elements like delaying jobs to periods of lower carbon intensity appear in CarbonClipper and CarbonScaler. The proposal acknowledges these similarities while emphasizing its more holistic approach and focus on continuous online adaptation. While not groundbreaking, GreenSched offers fresh perspectives and novel combinations of existing concepts that distinguish it from prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The MDP formulation is mathematically sound, with well-defined state and action spaces, transition dynamics, and reward function. The choice of PPO or SAC algorithms is appropriate given the complex, continuous state space and hybrid action space. The experimental methodology is comprehensive, including both simulation-based evaluation and real-world validation on a Kubernetes testbed. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, such as the sim-to-real gap. The data collection plan using real workload traces, energy price data, and carbon intensity data enhances the validity of the approach. One minor weakness is that the power models for components could be more precisely defined, and the proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of how the DRL agent will handle the potentially large state space efficiently. Overall, the technical approach is well-justified and rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation steps. The two-phase approach (simulation followed by testbed validation) is practical and reduces risks. The use of existing DRL libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch, Stable Baselines3/RLlib) and containerization (Docker) enhances implementability. The data requirements (workload traces, energy pricing, carbon intensity) can be met using publicly available sources. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) developing an accurate power model for heterogeneous hardware might be complex, (2) integrating with Kubernetes for real-time control requires significant engineering effort, (3) the potentially large state space might lead to training difficulties, and (4) the sim-to-real gap could be substantial. The timeline is not explicitly provided, which makes it difficult to assess temporal feasibility. While ambitious, the project appears manageable with appropriate resources and expertise, though some scope reduction might be necessary depending on constraints."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem with substantial potential impact. Reducing datacenter energy consumption and carbon emissions is highly relevant given their growing environmental footprint, especially with the rise of energy-intensive AI workloads. The expected outcomes (15-30% energy cost reduction, 20-40% carbon emission reduction) would represent meaningful contributions to sustainability efforts. The economic benefits from reduced operational costs provide strong incentives for adoption. The open-source release of GreenSched as a framework for sustainable computing research could accelerate progress in this field. The proposal also contributes methodological insights for applying DRL to systems problems. The work directly addresses the workshop's focus on compute sustainability and systems issues emerging from large-scale AI training/serving. While the impact might initially be limited to research environments, the potential for broader adoption in production systems is significant, especially given the validation on Kubernetes which increases practical relevance."
