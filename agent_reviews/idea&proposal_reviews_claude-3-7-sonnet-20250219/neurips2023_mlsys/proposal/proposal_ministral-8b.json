    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The GreenSched proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'ML for compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization' and specifically targets 'energy-aware job scheduling' as mentioned in the task description. The proposal faithfully expands on the initial idea, maintaining the core concept of a DRL-based scheduler that considers workload features, node utilization, electricity pricing, and carbon intensity. The literature review is well-integrated, with the proposal addressing the key challenges identified, such as balancing performance with sustainability and handling dynamic energy markets. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal could have more explicitly referenced some of the specific techniques or findings from the cited papers to demonstrate how GreenSched builds upon or differs from existing approaches like CarbonClipper or CarbonScaler."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described in detail, including the mathematical formulation of the DRL problem. The state representation, action space, and reward function are all clearly defined. The training and validation methodology is logically presented, with a clear progression from simulation to real-world testing. The evaluation metrics are also well-specified. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact weighting mechanism for the reward function components (α, β, γ) could be more precisely defined, (2) the specific techniques for forecasting renewable generation and carbon intensity could be elaborated, and (3) more details on how SLA violations are quantified would strengthen the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "GreenSched demonstrates good novelty in its comprehensive approach to energy and carbon-aware scheduling. While the literature review shows that carbon-aware scheduling is an active research area (with systems like CarbonClipper and CarbonScaler), GreenSched introduces several novel elements: (1) the integration of both energy costs and carbon emissions in a unified DRL framework, (2) the inclusion of power capping and VM migration in the action space, which extends beyond simple job placement, and (3) the end-to-end approach from training in simulation to deployment in Kubernetes. However, the core concept of using RL for sustainable scheduling is not entirely new, as evidenced by the 'Sustainable AIGC Workload Scheduling' paper mentioned in the literature review. The proposal could have more explicitly differentiated its approach from existing work or highlighted more groundbreaking aspects to achieve a higher novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness in its approach. The DRL formulation is mathematically rigorous, properly defining the MDP components (states, actions, transition function, reward function, and policy). The use of PPO for training is appropriate given its stability and performance in similar control tasks. The two-phase approach (simulation followed by real-world testing) is methodologically sound and reduces deployment risks. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive, covering both environmental impact and performance considerations. The proposal also acknowledges the need for hyperparameter tuning, which is crucial for DRL success. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) more details on how the transition function P(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t) is modeled or learned would enhance rigor, (2) the proposal could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential exploration strategies during training, and (3) a more thorough analysis of how the scheduler handles the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in a production environment would improve soundness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with a clear implementation path. The use of existing technologies (Kubernetes, PPO algorithms) increases feasibility, and the two-phase validation strategy (simulation followed by testbed) is practical. The required data inputs (resource demands, server utilization, carbon intensity) are generally available in modern data centers. However, several challenges affect the feasibility score: (1) obtaining accurate real-time carbon intensity and renewable generation forecasts may be difficult in some regions, (2) the complexity of the action space (including VM migrations and power capping) may lead to long training times and potential convergence issues, (3) integrating with existing job scheduling systems in production environments could be challenging, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the potential instability of RL policies in production environments. While these challenges don't make the project infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that would need to be overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "GreenSched addresses a critical and timely problem with substantial potential impact. The significance is high for several reasons: (1) Data centers are major energy consumers and carbon emitters, making improvements in this area environmentally important, (2) The proposal targets both economic benefits (reduced energy costs) and environmental benefits (lower carbon emissions), increasing its appeal to industry, (3) The commitment to release GreenSched as an open-source framework enhances its potential impact by enabling wider adoption and further research, (4) The approach is applicable to a wide range of cloud computing environments, not just specialized systems, and (5) The work directly aligns with growing regulatory and market pressures for sustainable computing. The anticipated 15-30% reduction in energy expenditure and 20-40% lower CO₂ footprint (if achieved) would represent a significant advancement in sustainable computing. The proposal also contributes methodologically to the ML for Systems field by demonstrating how DRL can be applied to complex multi-objective optimization problems in computing infrastructure."
