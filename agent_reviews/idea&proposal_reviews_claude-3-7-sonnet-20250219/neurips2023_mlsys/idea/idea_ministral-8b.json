    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the application of ML (specifically reinforcement learning) to computer systems problems, which is the core focus of the ML for Systems workshop. The proposal specifically targets LLM training scheduling, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as an area of interest ('systems issues that emerge from large-scale training'). The idea also touches on sustainability aspects through its focus on energy consumption reduction, which aligns with the workshop's interest in 'compute sustainability, including power/energy/carbon optimization.' The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address carbon footprint, though energy consumption is closely related."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (inefficient LLM training scheduling), the proposed solution (RL-based scheduling framework), and the expected outcomes (reduced training time and energy consumption). The components of the RL framework are well-defined, including environment design, agent design, reward function, and evaluation methodology. The only minor ambiguities are in the specifics of how the multi-agent system would coordinate decisions across GPUs/TPUs and how exactly the reward function would balance competing objectives like speed and energy efficiency. These details would need further elaboration in a full proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in applying RL to LLM training scheduling. While RL has been applied to various scheduling problems before, the specific application to LLM training at scale with a multi-agent approach represents a fresh perspective. The idea combines existing concepts (DQN, multi-agent systems) in a new domain context. However, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new RL algorithms or techniques, instead applying established methods to an important problem. The novelty lies more in the application domain and system design rather than in methodological innovation in reinforcement learning itself."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea is satisfactory but faces some implementation challenges. The core components (DQN, multi-agent systems) are well-established in RL literature, making the technical approach feasible. However, several practical challenges exist: (1) Creating an accurate simulation environment for LLM training that captures all relevant dynamics would be complex; (2) The multi-agent coordination across potentially thousands of GPUs/TPUs introduces scalability concerns; (3) Training the RL system itself would require significant computational resources; (4) Evaluating against real LLM training workloads would be expensive. These challenges don't make the idea infeasible, but they do represent considerable hurdles that would require substantial resources and expertise to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is high given the growing importance of LLMs and their computational demands. If successful, this approach could substantially reduce the resource requirements for training large models, which currently represent a major bottleneck in AI research and development. The potential impact extends beyond just academic interest - it could enable more organizations to train advanced models, reduce the environmental impact of AI, and accelerate the pace of AI research. The standardized methodology for scheduling could also have broader applications to other large-scale distributed computing tasks. The significance is particularly high given the workshop's explicit interest in systems issues related to large-scale training."
