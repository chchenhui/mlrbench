    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on multimodal time series models and leveraging pretrained models from other modalities. The MAFFT architecture implements the core concept from the research idea of using modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention and adaptive weighting. The proposal builds upon the cited literature, particularly extending approaches from Emami et al. (2023), Time-VLM (Zhong et al., 2025), and Hybrid-MMF (Kim et al., 2024). The methodology section thoroughly details how pretrained transformers for text and vision are integrated with time series data, addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions interpretability, it could have elaborated more on specific techniques to address this challenge highlighted in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the MAFFT architecture, including mathematical formulations for each component. The cross-modal attention mechanism and adaptive weighting approach are precisely defined with equations. The experimental design, including baselines, metrics, and ablation studies, is comprehensively outlined. The data preprocessing steps and implementation details are also well-specified. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the cross-modal attention module and the adaptive modality weighting could be more explicitly explained, (2) The exact procedure for fine-tuning the pretrained models could be more detailed, and (3) The proposal could better explain how the model handles potential misalignment between different modalities in real-world scenarios."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to multimodal time series forecasting. The adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of each modality based on context and data quality is a fresh contribution. The cross-modal attention fusion module that computes pairwise attention between all modalities also offers a novel perspective compared to existing approaches. However, the core architecture builds upon established concepts from the literature, particularly from Emami et al. (2023) and Zhong et al. (2025). While the proposal combines these elements in a new way and adds the adaptive weighting component, it represents an incremental rather than revolutionary advancement. The creation of the NewsTime dataset linking economic indicators to financial news and stock charts is a valuable contribution, but similar datasets have been explored in prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods. The mathematical formulations for the modality-specific encoders, cross-modal attention, and adaptive weighting are correctly presented and follow standard practices in deep learning. The training methodology, including loss functions, optimization techniques, and hyperparameters, is well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The proposal also addresses potential challenges in implementation and reproducibility. However, there are a few areas where the technical foundations could be strengthened: (1) The justification for the specific architecture choices (e.g., number of layers, hidden dimensions) could be more thoroughly explained, (2) The statistical properties of the proposed adaptive weighting mechanism could be analyzed more rigorously, and (3) The proposal could better address potential issues with overfitting when combining multiple modalities with limited training data."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and resources, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of pretrained models from HuggingFace makes the approach practical, and the detailed specification of hyperparameters and training procedures enhances implementability. The proposed datasets (M4, electricity consumption, traffic flow, TimeText Corpus, and the custom NewsTime dataset) are either publicly available or can be reasonably constructed. However, several aspects may present challenges: (1) The computational requirements for training with multiple pretrained models could be substantial, especially for large-scale datasets, (2) Creating the aligned multimodal NewsTime dataset with proper time alignment between numeric data, text, and images will require significant effort, (3) The fine-tuning of pretrained models while training the cross-modal attention mechanism may require careful optimization to prevent catastrophic forgetting or underfitting, and (4) The real-time inference latency with multiple modality encoders could be a practical limitation for some applications."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in time series forecasting with significant potential impact. By effectively integrating contextual information from multiple modalities, MAFFT could substantially improve forecasting accuracy during regime shifts and anomalous events, which are critical periods for decision-making in domains like finance, energy, and healthcare. The expected 5-15% improvement in standard metrics and up to 20% reduction in errors during anomalous periods would represent a meaningful advancement. The interpretability aspect, allowing domain experts to understand the contribution of different modalities, adds practical value. The introduction of a new benchmark dataset (NewsTime) could benefit the broader research community. The approach aligns well with the workshop's focus on leveraging large models for time series tasks and could inspire further research on multimodal foundation models for time series. However, the impact might be somewhat limited by the computational requirements and the need for aligned multimodal data, which may not be available in all application domains."
