    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's call for 'Multimodal Time Series Models' by developing a framework that integrates numerical time series with textual, visual, and categorical information. The DynamicFusion framework builds upon the core idea of using specialized attention mechanisms to dynamically weight different modalities, as outlined in the research idea. The proposal thoroughly acknowledges and extends the approaches mentioned in the literature review, specifically addressing limitations in existing works like the Modality-aware Transformer (limited to financial applications), Time-VLM (insufficient handling of dynamic modality importance), MST-GAT (focus on anomaly detection rather than forecasting), and Multi-Modal Forecaster (performance issues). The proposal maintains consistency throughout, with the methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes all clearly aligned with the initial problem statement and research objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding rather than obscuring it. The hierarchical cross-modal attention module and adaptive modality importance mechanism are explained in detail with clear equations. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined evaluation metrics and protocols. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the 'Data Quality Assessor' component could be more specific about how completeness, recency, and reliability metrics are calculated; (2) the relationship between the feature-level cross-attention and modality-level attention could be more explicitly defined; and (3) some of the mathematical notation could be more consistently applied throughout the document. Despite these minor issues, the overall clarity of the proposal is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The adaptive modality importance mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of each modality based on forecasting context is a novel contribution that addresses a gap in existing approaches. The hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture that operates at both feature and modality levels is also innovative. The context-aware importance estimator and data quality assessor components represent fresh approaches to the problem of multimodal fusion. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing work in multimodal attention mechanisms and time series forecasting, rather than introducing entirely new paradigms. Many of the individual components (transformer architectures, cross-attention mechanisms, multi-task learning) are adaptations of established techniques, albeit combined in novel ways. The proposal acknowledges its relationship to prior work like the Modality-aware Transformer and Time-VLM, positioning itself as an extension and improvement rather than a revolutionary approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for the various components (encoders, attention mechanisms, fusion techniques) are correctly presented and follow established principles in deep learning. The multi-task learning approach with a carefully designed loss function that balances forecasting accuracy, reconstruction quality, and regularization is theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical validation procedures. The hierarchical approach to cross-modal attention is well-motivated by the need to capture both fine-grained feature interactions and high-level modality relationships. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes mechanisms to address them, such as the data quality assessor to handle varying reliability across modalities. One minor limitation is that while the adaptive modality importance mechanism is intuitively appealing, the proposal could provide stronger theoretical justification for why this approach would outperform simpler attention mechanisms. Overall, the technical foundations are solid and the methodology is rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components, though it does involve significant implementation challenges. On the positive side, the approach builds on established deep learning architectures and techniques, many of which have open-source implementations available. The data collection plan spans three domains (finance, energy, healthcare) which are all reasonable choices with available datasets. The evaluation metrics and experimental protocol are well-defined and standard in the field. However, several aspects present feasibility challenges: (1) The integration of multiple pre-trained models (for text, vision, etc.) will require substantial computational resources for both training and inference; (2) The requirement for temporally aligned multimodal data across three domains may be difficult to satisfy, particularly for healthcare where data access is often restricted; (3) The complex architecture with multiple attention mechanisms and adaptive components may require extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance; (4) The implementation of the data quality assessor component requires domain-specific knowledge to define appropriate quality metrics. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the proposal infeasible, but rather indicate that successful execution will require careful planning, sufficient resources, and potentially some scope adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem with significant potential impact across multiple domains. Enhancing time series forecasting by incorporating multimodal information has direct applications in critical areas such as finance (predicting market movements during volatile periods), energy (forecasting consumption during extreme weather events), and healthcare (monitoring patient conditions with contextual information). The adaptive nature of the proposed framework is particularly significant as it addresses a key limitation in current approaches: the varying relevance of different modalities across different forecasting scenarios. The expected improvements in forecasting accuracy during anomalous periods (30-40% reduction in error) would represent a substantial advance over current methods. Beyond the immediate applications, the methodological contributions around dynamic multimodal fusion could influence research in other areas requiring adaptive information integration. The proposal also contributes to the broader trend of leveraging foundation models for specialized tasks, aligning with the workshop's focus on time series in the age of large models. While the impact is potentially high, it is somewhat constrained by the specific focus on forecasting rather than addressing the full range of time series tasks (classification, anomaly detection, etc.), though the authors do note potential extensions to these areas."
