    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on multimodal time series models and leveraging pretrained models from other modalities. The proposed MAFT architecture implements the core concept from the research idea of using cross-modal attention to fuse numerical time series with contextual information from text and images. The proposal cites and builds upon the literature review papers, particularly extending the work of Emami et al. (2023) and Zhong et al. (2025) on multimodal approaches. The methodology section thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, including modality integration complexity, attention mechanism design, and interpretability. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions using the TimeText Corpus from Kim et al. (2024), it doesn't explicitly discuss the joint forecasting of text and time series as explored in that paper."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The MAFT architecture components are well-defined, including modality-specific encoders, cross-modal attention fusion, adaptive modality weighting, and the forecasting head. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for temporal alignment between different modalities could be more precisely defined, (2) The proposal could better explain how the model handles missing modalities during inference, and (3) The relationship between the cross-modal attention and the adaptive weighting module could be more explicitly differentiated to avoid potential confusion about their distinct roles."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a novel architecture that combines several innovative elements. The hierarchical attention mechanism with both intra-modal and cross-modal components offers a fresh approach to multimodal fusion. The adaptive weighting module that dynamically adjusts modality influence based on data quality and relevance is particularly innovative. However, many of the individual components build upon existing techniques: the use of pretrained BERT and ViT models is standard practice, and cross-modal attention has been explored in papers like Emami et al. (2023) and Zhong et al. (2025). The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches. The main novelty lies in the specific combination of techniques and the application to time series forecasting during anomalous events, rather than in developing entirely new foundational methods. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly articulating how its approach differs from existing multimodal fusion techniques in the literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for the various components of the MAFT architecture are correctly presented and follow established practices in deep learning. The use of TCNs for time series encoding is appropriate given their effectiveness in capturing long-term dependencies. The cross-modal attention mechanism is well-formulated and builds on proven transformer architectures. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal could provide more theoretical justification for why the specific attention mechanism design would be optimal for multimodal fusion, (2) There is limited discussion of potential failure modes or edge cases where the approach might not perform well, and (3) While the adaptive weighting mechanism is promising, more rigorous analysis of its convergence properties or potential instabilities during training would enhance the soundness of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The use of existing pretrained models (BERT, ViT) reduces the computational burden of training from scratch. The datasets mentioned (TimeText Corpus, M5 Competition Data, Financial Datasets) are available and appropriate for the task. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is well-defined and achievable. However, there are several feasibility concerns: (1) The computational resources required for training the full MAFT architecture with multiple pretrained components could be substantial, especially for large-scale datasets, (2) The temporal alignment of multimodal data in real-world settings is often challenging and may require significant preprocessing effort, (3) The proposal mentions a 10-15% improvement over baselines during anomalous events, which may be optimistic given the complexity of the problem, and (4) The implementation of the hierarchical attention mechanism and adaptive weighting module would require careful engineering to ensure stable training. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present significant implementation hurdles that would need to be addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem with significant potential impact. Improving time series forecasting during anomalous events or regime changes has substantial practical value across multiple domains including healthcare, energy, and finance. The integration of multimodal data to provide contextual information during unusual events could lead to more robust and accurate forecasting systems. The proposed approach aligns well with the workshop's focus on advancing time series analysis in the age of large models. The expected outcomes include not just improved forecasting accuracy but also interpretability insights into how different modalities contribute to predictions. The open-sourcing of code and pretrained models would benefit the scientific community. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the proposal focuses primarily on forecasting accuracy rather than addressing some of the deeper theoretical questions about foundation models for time series. Additionally, while the proposal mentions real-world applications, it could more thoroughly explore the potential societal impacts and ethical considerations of deploying such systems in critical domains like healthcare."
