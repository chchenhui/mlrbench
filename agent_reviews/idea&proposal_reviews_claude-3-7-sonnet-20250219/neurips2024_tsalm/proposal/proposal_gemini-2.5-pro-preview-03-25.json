    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on multimodal time series models and leveraging pretrained models from other modalities. The proposed Adaptive Multimodal Attention Fusion (AMAF) framework precisely implements the core idea of fusing numerical time series with contextual information using specialized attention mechanisms. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, building upon concepts like modality-specific encoders, cross-modal attention, and adaptive weighting mechanisms. It acknowledges and addresses key challenges identified in the literature, such as modality integration complexity, attention mechanism design, and model interpretability. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions potential use of visual data, it primarily focuses on text and numerical data fusion, slightly narrowing the full multimodal scope suggested in the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical details of the AMAF architecture are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach concrete and implementable. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined baselines, datasets, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for temporal alignment between modalities could be more precisely defined, as this is crucial for the model's success; (2) Some technical details about the adaptive weighting mechanism could be further elaborated, particularly how the model handles potential overfitting to one modality; and (3) The proposal could more clearly specify the exact datasets to be used rather than providing candidate options. Despite these minor issues, the overall clarity is strong, with logical flow and sufficient technical detail."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in several aspects. The core innovation lies in the adaptive multimodal attention fusion mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of different modalities based on their relevance to the current forecasting context. This goes beyond the static fusion or simpler attention schemes mentioned in the literature review. The bidirectional cross-modal attention allowing information flow between modalities is also a valuable contribution. However, many of the individual components build upon existing techniques in multimodal learning and attention mechanisms. The modality-specific encoders leverage established architectures, and cross-attention is a known concept in multimodal learning. The proposal acknowledges related work like the Modality-aware Transformer [1] and Time-VLM [2], and while it extends these approaches with the adaptive weighting scheme, the core architectural elements share similarities with existing methods. The novelty is therefore good but not groundbreaking, representing an important incremental advancement rather than a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for the cross-modal attention and adaptive weighting mechanisms are technically correct and build upon established transformer architectures. The training procedure, including loss functions, optimization strategies, and regularization techniques, follows best practices in deep learning. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the contribution of each component. The proposal is grounded in the literature, building upon proven approaches while addressing identified limitations. The adaptive weighting mechanism is theoretically well-motivated to handle the varying relevance of different modalities. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) The proposal could more explicitly address potential issues with modality dominance or conflicting signals between modalities; (2) The statistical properties of the adaptive weighting mechanism could be more thoroughly analyzed; and (3) The computational complexity analysis could be more detailed. Overall, the approach is technically sound with minor areas for improvement."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components and implementation strategies. The use of existing pre-trained models for modality-specific encoders reduces the computational burden of training from scratch. The proposed architecture, while sophisticated, builds upon established transformer components that have well-documented implementations. The training procedure includes practical considerations like parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to manage computational costs. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) The availability of high-quality, time-aligned multimodal datasets is acknowledged as a potential issue, with the proposal suggesting semi-synthetic data generation as a fallback, which introduces additional complexity; (2) The computational requirements for training multiple transformer-based encoders plus the fusion mechanism could be substantial, potentially limiting experimentation scope; (3) The proposal mentions but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of proper temporal alignment between modalities, which is crucial for real-world implementation; and (4) The comprehensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses proposed will require significant additional experimentation time. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present meaningful implementation hurdles that could affect the scope or timeline of the research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in time series forecasting - the inability of traditional models to incorporate rich contextual information from other modalities, particularly during periods of high volatility or regime shifts. This limitation has real-world implications across domains like finance, energy, healthcare, and retail. The proposed AMAF framework has the potential to substantially improve forecasting accuracy during critical events, which is particularly valuable in practical applications. The research directly contributes to multiple workshop topics, including multimodal time series models, leveraging pretrained models from other modalities, and real-world applications. The interpretability aspects of the research, analyzing how different modalities contribute to predictions, address the important challenge of understanding black-box models. The planned open-source contribution would benefit the broader research community. While the significance is high, it's not transformative in the sense of creating an entirely new paradigm - rather, it represents an important advancement in multimodal time series forecasting that builds upon and extends existing approaches in a meaningful way. The practical impact would be substantial if the approach demonstrates the expected improvements in robustness during anomalous events."
