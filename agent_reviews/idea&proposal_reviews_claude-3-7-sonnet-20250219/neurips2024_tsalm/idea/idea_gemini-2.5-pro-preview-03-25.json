        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on time series in the age of large models. It specifically addresses the 'Multimodal Time Series Models' topic by proposing a framework that integrates numerical time series data with textual event data. The idea also touches on 'Leveraging Pretrained Models of Other Modalities for Time Series' by utilizing LLMs for encoding textual context. The proposal is highly relevant to real-world applications in finance and energy, which are explicitly mentioned in the workshop scope. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly discuss evaluation metrics or benchmarking, which are also part of the workshop's interests."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, motivation, and proposed solution. The framework's components (core time series model, event detection module, LLM for text encoding, and fusion mechanism) are logically presented. The expected benefits and target domains are explicitly stated. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific design of the gating/attention mechanism, how the event detection module would work in practice, and what metrics would be used to evaluate the model's performance, particularly in capturing event-driven shifts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel approach by dynamically integrating textual event data with numerical time series, particularly through the adaptive fusion mechanism that responds to detected anomalies or uncertainty. While multimodal approaches combining text and time series exist, the dynamic and context-aware fusion aspect adds originality. The use of foundation models for both modalities is timely and innovative. However, the core components (transformer-based time series models, LLMs for text, attention mechanisms) are established techniques being combined in a new way rather than representing fundamentally new methods. The novelty lies in the integration approach and application context rather than in developing entirely new algorithms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed research is feasible with current technology and methods. Transformer-based time series models and LLMs are well-established, and mechanisms for multimodal fusion have precedents in the literature. However, several implementation challenges exist: (1) obtaining aligned datasets of time series and relevant textual events with proper timestamps, (2) designing an effective event detection module that can identify truly impactful events, (3) developing a fusion mechanism that appropriately weights textual information based on relevance and uncertainty, and (4) computational requirements for running both time series and language models concurrently. These challenges are surmountable but would require significant engineering effort and careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important limitation in current time series forecasting: the inability to anticipate shifts caused by external events. The potential impact is substantial, particularly in domains like finance, energy, and policy analysis where external events frequently drive significant changes. Improving forecasting accuracy during volatile periods would provide tangible value to decision-makers. The approach also advances the broader field of multimodal learning by exploring dynamic fusion techniques. The significance is enhanced by the practical applicability of the research and its alignment with current trends toward foundation models. However, the impact might be somewhat limited by domain-specificity and the need for high-quality textual data sources."
