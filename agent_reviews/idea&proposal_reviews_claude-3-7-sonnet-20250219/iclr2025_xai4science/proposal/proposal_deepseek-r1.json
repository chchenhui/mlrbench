    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on a-priori interpretability and self-explainable models for healthcare applications. The proposal incorporates the core concept from the research idea of knowledge-guided self-explainable models that integrate biomedical ontologies into GNNs and additive models. It builds upon the literature review by addressing the identified challenges, particularly balancing predictive performance with interpretability and integrating complex biomedical knowledge. The methodology section clearly draws inspiration from papers like IA-GCN and Factor Graph Neural Network mentioned in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the task description mentions three scientific application areas (weather/climate, healthcare, and material science), the proposal focuses exclusively on healthcare/biomedicine."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail, including mathematical formulations for the knowledge-guided GNN module and additive model module. The figures referenced (e.g., Figure 1) enhance understanding, though they aren't visible in the provided text. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are comprehensively outlined. There are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the GNN and additive model outputs isn't fully specified, (2) the hyperparameters λ1 and λ2 in the joint training loss function could use more guidance on how they'll be determined, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'shape-constrained spline functions') might benefit from brief explanations for non-specialists."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements. The integration of biomedical ontologies directly into model architectures (rather than as post-hoc explanations) represents a fresh approach. The hybrid architecture combining GNNs for graph-structured knowledge with additive models for tabular clinical data is innovative, as is the joint training with a hybrid loss function balancing prediction and interpretability. The prior-enhanced graph attention layer that incorporates edge semantics from ontologies is a novel technical contribution. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing work cited in the literature review (particularly IA-GCN and Factor Graph Neural Network), and many of the individual components (GNNs, attention mechanisms, additive models) are established techniques. The novelty lies more in their combination and application to biomedical discovery rather than in fundamentally new algorithmic approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for the knowledge-guided GNN module and additive model are correctly presented and well-justified. The approach to incorporate domain knowledge through ontologies is theoretically sound and aligns with established practices in the field. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics covering both predictive performance and explainability. The validation pipeline, including in silico and in vitro/in vivo validation, strengthens the scientific rigor. The proposal also acknowledges the need for expert evaluation of explanations, which is crucial for biomedical applications. The only minor weaknesses are: (1) the interpretability regularization term (Lint) could be more precisely defined, and (2) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential limitations or failure modes of the approach, such as cases where domain knowledge might be incomplete or contradictory."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents several implementation challenges. The data sources (TCGA, GTEx, MIMIC-III, UK Biobank) are well-established and accessible, though some may require significant effort to obtain permissions. The technical approach builds on existing methods (GNNs, additive models) that have proven implementations. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The integration of complex biomedical ontologies into model architectures is technically challenging and computationally intensive; (2) The in vitro/in vivo validation through collaborations with biologists to test therapeutic hypotheses (e.g., CRISPR knockout) is ambitious and resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise and facilities; (3) The expert evaluation component requires significant time commitment from domain experts; (4) The proposal doesn't address computational requirements or potential scalability issues when working with large biomedical datasets and complex graph structures. While the individual components are feasible, the integration of all aspects into a cohesive framework and the validation pipeline would require substantial resources and interdisciplinary collaboration."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in healthcare AI: the need for models that are both highly predictive and interpretable by design. This work has the potential for substantial impact in several ways: (1) It could bridge the gap between ML and mechanistic understanding in biomedicine, enabling AI to serve as a tool for scientific discovery rather than just prediction; (2) The discovery of novel biomarkers and disease subtypes could directly advance precision medicine and improve patient outcomes; (3) By enhancing trust in ML systems among clinicians, it could accelerate the adoption of AI in healthcare settings; (4) The proposed framework could serve as a blueprint for developing self-explainable models in other scientific domains. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's focus on validation through expert evaluation and experimental assays, ensuring that model-derived insights have real scientific utility. The work directly addresses the workshop's goal of using interpretable AI to discover new human knowledge, particularly in healthcare applications."
