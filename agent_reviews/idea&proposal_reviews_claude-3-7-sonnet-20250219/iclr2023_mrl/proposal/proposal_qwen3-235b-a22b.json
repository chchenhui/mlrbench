    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on multimodal representation learning, particularly the question about how geometry affects representation quality. The proposed geometric alignment framework using Optimal Transport and Riemannian geometry perfectly matches the initial research idea. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with references to GRAM (Cicchetti et al., 2024), misalignment studies (Yichao et al., 2025), and latent modality structures (Qian et al., 2023). The proposal also addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as modality misalignment, scalability to multiple modalities, and balancing redundant and unique information."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, problem statement, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical formulations are precise and well-presented, with appropriate mathematical notation for the loss functions and algorithms. The experimental design is thoroughly described with specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact implementation details of the Riemannian loss could be more explicit, (2) the tensor decomposition approach for scaling to M-modal scenarios is mentioned but not fully elaborated, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'Stochastic Modality Masking') are introduced without complete explanation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of Optimal Transport and Riemannian geometry for multimodal alignment represents a fresh approach compared to traditional contrastive methods. The hybrid loss function combining instance-level alignment with manifold-level regularization is innovative and addresses limitations in current approaches. The proposal also introduces novel evaluation methods through synthetic benchmarks with controlled alignment strengths. While some individual components (OT, Riemannian metrics) have been used in related contexts, their combination and application to multimodal representation alignment, especially with the focus on geometric consistency, represents a novel contribution to the field. The proposal builds upon existing work like GRAM but extends it in meaningful new directions."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in established theoretical frameworks. The mathematical formulations for the contrastive, OT, and Riemannian losses are technically correct and grounded in relevant literature. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the connection between the proposed Riemannian loss and actual Riemannian geometry concepts could be more rigorously established, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the hybrid loss are not fully addressed, and (3) the claim that geometric alignment degrades exponentially with modality count would benefit from more formal analysis. While the overall approach is sound, these theoretical gaps slightly reduce the score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The use of established datasets (MS-COCO, HowTo100M, Flickr8k) and pre-trained encoders (ResNet-50, ViT, RoBERTa) makes the implementation practical. The computational complexity is acknowledged and mitigated through entropic regularization in OT. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the Riemannian loss computation for large batches could be computationally intensive, (2) the Bayesian optimization for adaptive weighting of loss components adds another layer of complexity, and (3) the creation of synthetic benchmarks with controlled alignment strengths may require significant effort. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present implementation hurdles that need to be carefully managed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in multimodal representation learning with potentially far-reaching implications. By focusing on geometric alignment, it tackles a core issue that affects numerous downstream applications. The expected improvements in cross-modal retrieval, generation, and robustness to missing modalities would benefit multiple domains including healthcare, robotics, and creative content generation. The theoretical contributions regarding the alignment vs. specificity trade-off and the curse of modality count could advance our understanding of multimodal learning principles. The proposal also includes open-sourcing code and datasets, which would benefit the broader research community. The work directly addresses the workshop's key questions about representation geometry, training objectives, and modality interactions, making it highly significant to the field."
