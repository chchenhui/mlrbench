    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on multimodal representation learning, particularly the question of 'How does the geometry of the representation space affect the quality of the learned representations?' The proposal's core focus on geometric alignment between modalities is consistent with the original research idea, implementing both Optimal Transport and Riemannian manifold alignment as suggested. The literature review is well-integrated, with explicit references to works by Cicchetti et al. (2024), Jiang et al. (2023), and Tjandrasuwita et al. (2025). The proposal also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as modality misalignment and balancing redundant and unique information. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions scalability to multiple modalities as a challenge, the proposal primarily focuses on pairs of modalities in its formulation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with well-defined stages: Unimodal Encoding, Geometric Alignment, and Downstream Task Optimization. The mathematical formulations for the Optimal Transport and Riemannian Manifold Alignment objectives are precisely defined. The experimental design outlines specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact implementation details of the Riemannian Manifold Alignment could be more thoroughly explained, particularly how the k-nearest neighbors are determined across modalities; (2) The hyperparameters α, β, and γ in the total loss function lack guidance on how they would be determined; and (3) While Figure 1 is referenced, it's not actually included in the proposal, which would have enhanced understanding of the framework's architecture."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining Optimal Transport and Riemannian Manifold Alignment approaches for geometric alignment in multimodal representation learning. This combination offers a fresh perspective on addressing the challenge of geometric misalignment between modalities. The approach extends beyond traditional instance-level alignment methods (like contrastive learning) to focus on structural properties of the embedding spaces. However, the individual components (OT and manifold alignment) have been explored in prior work, as evidenced by the literature review mentioning GRAM, Brownian-bridge alignment, and geometric consistency loss. The proposal's novelty lies more in the specific combination and application of these techniques rather than introducing entirely new concepts. The multi-stage framework that separates unimodal encoding from geometric alignment is a thoughtful design, but not revolutionary. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly articulating how its approach differs from or improves upon the GRAM method mentioned in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for both the Optimal Transport and Riemannian Manifold Alignment objectives are correctly presented and well-justified. The multi-task learning approach that combines different loss functions is a well-established methodology. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate datasets, relevant baselines, and a variety of evaluation metrics that address both task performance and geometric properties. The ablation study to isolate contributions of different components demonstrates methodological rigor. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential limitations of the approach, such as computational complexity of OT calculations for large datasets; (2) While the RMA objective aims to preserve k-nearest neighbors, the justification for why this particular approach to manifold alignment was chosen over alternatives is not thoroughly explained; and (3) The proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential failure modes or edge cases where the geometric alignment might not be beneficial."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The datasets mentioned (HowTo100M, COCO, Audioset) are publicly available and commonly used in multimodal research. The baseline methods are well-established, and the evaluation metrics are standard in the field. The mathematical formulations, while complex, are implementable using current deep learning frameworks and optimization techniques. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) Optimal Transport calculations can be computationally expensive for large datasets, potentially requiring approximation methods like Sinkhorn iterations; (2) The Riemannian Manifold Alignment requires efficient nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces, which can be challenging at scale; (3) The multi-task optimization with three different loss components may require careful tuning of the weighting parameters (α, β, γ) to achieve stable training. The proposal would benefit from addressing these computational considerations and providing more details on how to efficiently implement the geometric alignment objectives at scale."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in multimodal representation learning with potentially broad impact. Understanding and improving geometric alignment between modalities could advance both theoretical understanding and practical applications of multimodal systems. The expected outcomes include improved cross-modal task performance, enhanced representation robustness, and quantifiable geometric insights, all of which would be valuable contributions to the field. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications in healthcare, robotics, and accessibility, demonstrating the proposal's significance beyond academic interest. The standardization of evaluation protocols for geometric properties in multimodal learning would benefit the research community by fostering reproducibility and benchmarking. However, while the significance is clear, the proposal could more explicitly quantify the expected improvements over existing methods and provide more concrete examples of how the improved geometric alignment would translate to real-world benefits in the application domains mentioned."
