        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns very well with the task description, addressing the challenge of interpretability in foundation models, which is a central focus of the workshop. The proposed multi-level knowledge distillation framework directly tackles the question of 'What interpretability approaches are best suited for large-scale models and foundation models?' mentioned in the task. The idea of creating 'interpretability islands' within complex models addresses the spectrum between classical interpretable methods and modern approaches for large-scale models. The proposal also touches on several other workshop topics, including assessment of interpretable models, applications across domains, and the future landscape of interpretability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity, outlining a structured approach with three well-defined components: concept-based distillation, decision path extraction, and neural-symbolic integration. The motivation is clearly articulated, highlighting the gap between model sophistication and human understanding. The expected outcomes are also well-specified, describing different levels of interpretability for different stakeholders. However, some technical details about how the distillation process would work in practice, particularly for the neural-symbolic integration component, could benefit from further elaboration. The idea of 'interpretability islands' is intriguing but would need more concrete explanation of implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to interpretability for foundation models. While knowledge distillation itself is not new, the multi-level framework that specifically targets interpretability rather than just model compression is relatively fresh. The concept of selectively creating 'interpretability islands' based on decision impact is an innovative perspective. The integration of concept-based distillation with decision path extraction and neural-symbolic methods creates a novel combination. However, each individual component builds upon existing techniques in interpretability research, and similar approaches have been explored in smaller models, which somewhat limits the overall originality."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. Knowledge distillation from foundation models while preserving performance is technically difficult, especially when targeting interpretability rather than just compression. The neural-symbolic integration component may be particularly challenging given the scale and complexity of foundation models. The proposal to identify which parts require interpretability based on decision impact is sensible but may require significant computational resources and methodological innovation. While the overall approach is theoretically implementable with current technology, it would likely require substantial engineering effort and may face trade-offs between interpretability and performance that are not fully addressed in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in AI development: making increasingly complex foundation models more transparent and trustworthy. The significance is high because interpretability is essential for regulatory compliance, ethical deployment, and user trust in high-stakes domains. The multi-level approach that caters to different stakeholders' needs (from end-users to auditors) is particularly valuable. If successful, this framework could bridge the gap between the power of foundation models and the need for transparency, potentially influencing how large models are developed and deployed across industries. The work directly addresses a pressing need identified in the task description regarding interpretability approaches for large-scale models."
