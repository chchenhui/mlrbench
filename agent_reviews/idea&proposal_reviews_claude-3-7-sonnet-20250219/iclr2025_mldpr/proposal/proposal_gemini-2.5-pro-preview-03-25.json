        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on holistic benchmarking, comprehensive documentation, and the need for culture shift in ML data practices. The proposal builds upon the concept of Model Cards (Mitchell et al., 2018) to create Benchmark Cards, which is perfectly consistent with the original idea. It incorporates the holistic evaluation approaches from HELM (Liang et al., 2022) and HEM (Li et al., 2024) as mentioned in the literature review. The proposal thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, including the overemphasis on single metrics, lack of standardized documentation, insufficient consideration of contextual factors, and inadequate evaluation of model limitations. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions integration with repositories like Hugging Face, OpenML, and UCI ML Repository (as highlighted in the workshop description), it could have elaborated more on specific integration strategies with these platforms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The problem statement is precisely defined, and the proposed solution (Benchmark Cards) is explained in detail. The methodology is laid out in four distinct phases with specific activities and deliverables for each. The technical aspects, including the proposed sections of the Benchmark Card template and evaluation metrics, are well-defined. The proposal includes mathematical formulations (e.g., for fairness metrics) that enhance precision. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact process for validating the effectiveness of Benchmark Cards could be more detailed, particularly regarding metrics for measuring success beyond expert feedback; (2) The proposal mentions a potential user study but doesn't fully commit to it or detail its design; (3) While the proposal outlines integration with repositories as an objective, the specific technical approach for this integration could be more concrete."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by adapting the concept of Model Cards to create Benchmark Cards, which addresses a gap in the current documentation landscape. While Model Cards focus on models and Datasheets focus on datasets, the proposal correctly identifies that there is no standardized documentation framework specifically for benchmarks (the combination of datasets, tasks, metrics, and protocols). The inclusion of a 'Recommended Holistic Metrics Suite' that goes beyond primary metrics is an innovative aspect that directly addresses the problem of single-metric optimization. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that the proposal heavily builds upon existing frameworks (Model Cards, HELM, HEM) rather than introducing entirely new concepts. The approach to holistic evaluation metrics draws significantly from existing work like HELM and HEM, though applying these concepts specifically to benchmark documentation is a novel contribution. The proposal acknowledges this derivative nature while highlighting its unique contribution to the benchmarking ecosystem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. It is built on solid theoretical foundations from established literature on model documentation, holistic evaluation, and responsible AI. The methodology is well-structured with a logical progression from framework definition to validation and dissemination. The proposed sections for Benchmark Cards are comprehensive and address the key aspects needed for proper benchmark contextualization. The inclusion of mathematical formulations for metrics like Demographic Parity Difference shows technical precision. The research draws appropriately from prior work (Mitchell et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2024) while extending it to a new domain. The phased approach to development and validation is methodologically sound. However, there are some minor gaps: (1) The proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential challenges in standardizing metrics across diverse benchmark types; (2) While fairness metrics are well-defined, some other proposed metrics (e.g., robustness, efficiency) could be more precisely formulated; (3) The validation methodology relies heavily on expert feedback, which may introduce subjectivity - more objective validation measures could strengthen the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly feasible research plan with realistic scope and clear implementation steps. The four-phase methodology breaks down the work into manageable components with specific activities and deliverables. The proposal targets creating Benchmark Cards for 3-5 benchmarks, which is a reasonable scope for demonstrating the concept without overextending resources. The technical requirements are modest, primarily involving documentation work rather than complex system development or extensive data collection. The research leverages existing frameworks and literature, making implementation more straightforward. The template design and population phases have clear criteria and processes. The proposal acknowledges potential resource constraints (e.g., making the user study optional depending on resources) and provides contingency plans. The dissemination strategy through open-source repositories and academic publications is practical and aligned with community norms. The only minor concern is that securing expert feedback and potential engagement from repository maintainers may be challenging, but this is acknowledged implicitly in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the ML benchmarking ecosystem that has significant implications for research integrity, model selection, and responsible AI deployment. By promoting holistic evaluation beyond single metrics, the Benchmark Cards framework directly tackles a fundamental problem in current ML practices that leads to models optimized for leaderboards rather than real-world utility. The potential impact spans multiple dimensions: (1) Scientific impact through improved benchmark documentation and evaluation practices; (2) Practical impact by helping practitioners select more appropriate models for specific applications; (3) Educational impact by providing clearer context for benchmarks used in teaching and learning; (4) Ethical impact by encouraging consideration of fairness, robustness, and other responsible AI dimensions. The proposal aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of catalyzing positive changes in the ML data ecosystem. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's focus on integration with major repositories like Hugging Face, OpenML, and UCI ML Repository, which could lead to widespread adoption. The only limitation is that actual impact depends on community adoption, which is acknowledged but not fully addressed in the implementation strategy."
