        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on holistic benchmarking, dataset documentation, and alternative benchmarking paradigms. The proposal builds upon the literature review's key works, particularly extending the concept of Model Cards to benchmarks and incorporating holistic evaluation approaches similar to HELM. The methodology section thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as overemphasis on single metrics and lack of standardized documentation. The proposal maintains consistency throughout, from the problem statement to the expected outcomes, all while staying true to the original research idea of creating Benchmark Cards."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections that flow logically. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are well-defined and easy to understand. The framework design for Benchmark Cards is presented with specific components and implementation details. The experimental validation plan is particularly well-articulated with three distinct phases and clear metrics. The mathematical formulation for the composite scoring is precise and understandable. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more details on how the adversarial weight-rebalancing process would be implemented in practice and how the longitudinal evaluation would be conducted across different publication venues. Overall, the proposal maintains a high level of clarity throughout."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel extension of the Model Cards concept to benchmarks, which fills a significant gap in the current ML ecosystem. While it builds upon existing documentation frameworks like Model Cards and evaluation approaches like HELM, the application to benchmarks and the specific framework design represent innovative contributions. The adversarial weight-rebalancing process for operationalizing composite scoring is particularly original. The proposal also introduces novel experimental validation approaches, especially the controlled experiment comparing model selection with and without Benchmark Cards. However, some elements, such as the multi-metric evaluation approach, draw heavily from existing work like HELM and HEM, which slightly reduces the overall novelty score. Nevertheless, the comprehensive framework and its application to standardizing benchmark documentation represent a significant innovation in the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-founded and builds upon established research in ML evaluation and documentation. The framework design is logically structured and addresses key aspects of benchmark documentation. The experimental validation plan includes appropriate metrics and methodologies for assessing the effectiveness of Benchmark Cards. The mathematical formulation for composite scoring is technically sound. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved. For instance, the adversarial weight-rebalancing process could benefit from more formal mathematical definition and analysis of its properties. Additionally, while the proposal mentions collecting importance weights from experts, it doesn't fully address potential issues of subjectivity and bias in this process. The longitudinal evaluation metrics could also be more precisely defined to ensure reliable measurement of impact. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible implementation plan with clear phases and deliverables. The selection of 5-7 benchmarks across different modalities is reasonable and achievable. The methodology for developing Benchmark Cards through literature surveys and expert interviews is practical. The experimental validation plan, particularly the template fidelity and adoption impact phases, is implementable with the resources typically available in academic research. However, there are some feasibility concerns. The longitudinal evaluation over 24 months may be challenging within typical research timeframes. The goal of achieving institutional adoption by major repositories like OpenML, HuggingFace, and NeurIPS is ambitious and depends on factors beyond the researchers' control. The proposal also requires coordination with numerous stakeholders, including benchmark creators and ML researchers, which adds complexity. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present significant hurdles that would need to be carefully managed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the ML ecosystem and has the potential for substantial impact. By standardizing benchmark documentation and promoting holistic evaluation, it directly tackles key challenges identified in the workshop description and literature review. The potential benefits are far-reaching: improved model selection for real-world applications, reduced risks in deploying ML systems, and a cultural shift away from single-metric optimization toward comprehensive evaluation. The proposal could significantly influence research practices, as evidenced by the measurable impact targets for 2027. The framework also has implications beyond academia, potentially affecting how ML models are evaluated and deployed in industry settings. The connection to safety-critical applications like healthcare diagnostics further underscores its significance. By creating a standardized approach to benchmark documentation and evaluation, the proposal could fundamentally reshape how the ML community approaches benchmarking and model assessment."
