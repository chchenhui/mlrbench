        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of improving large language models' robustness by leveraging causal principles to mitigate spurious correlations, which is a key focus area mentioned in the task description under 'Causality for large models.' The three-stage methodology (identifying spurious correlations, generating counterfactual pairs, and counterfactually guided fine-tuning) precisely implements the main idea outlined in the research idea. The proposal also builds upon and cites relevant literature from the review, including Jin et al. (2023), Kıcıman et al. (2023), and Doe & Smith (2023), demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research in this area. The only minor inconsistency is that some papers cited in the proposal (e.g., Kuangkan et al., 2024) are not explicitly mentioned in the literature review."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the three-stage methodology is explained in detail with concrete examples (e.g., the rural clinic example). The mathematical formulations of the causal relationships and loss function are precise and well-defined. The experimental design section comprehensively outlines datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, and implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact process for automated causal discovery in Stage 1 could be more detailed, (2) the validation process for ensuring counterfactual examples maintain the spurious correlate S while changing the causal feature X could be more explicitly described, and (3) the relationship between the counterfactual consistency term in the loss function and the goal of ignoring spurious correlations could be more thoroughly explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining counterfactual reasoning with LLM fine-tuning in a structured way. While counterfactual data augmentation has been explored before (as mentioned in the literature review with Doe & Smith, 2023), this proposal innovates by integrating counterfactual consistency directly into the loss function during fine-tuning, rather than merely expanding the dataset. The three-stage approach that systematically identifies spurious correlations, generates counterfactual pairs, and then guides fine-tuning with these pairs represents a fresh perspective on improving LLM robustness. However, the proposal shares some similarities with existing approaches in causal fine-tuning (e.g., Brown & Green, 2024, from the literature review), and the basic concept of using counterfactuals to improve model fairness has precedents (e.g., Johnson & Lee, 2023). While not entirely groundbreaking, the proposal offers a well-integrated and thoughtful approach to an important problem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations from causal inference. The causal graph formulation (Y ← X → S → Y_spurious) provides a clear framework for understanding the problem of spurious correlations. The loss function combining standard cross-entropy with a KL divergence term for counterfactual consistency is mathematically appropriate for the stated goal. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets (synthetic and real-world), relevant baselines, and meaningful evaluation metrics that directly measure the objectives of improved robustness, fairness, and causal reasoning. The implementation details are specific and realistic. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the proposal assumes that spurious correlations can be reliably identified, which may be challenging in practice, (2) the automated generation of counterfactual examples might introduce biases or inconsistencies that aren't fully addressed, and (3) the proposal could more thoroughly discuss potential limitations of the approach, such as cases where the simplified causal graph might not accurately represent the true data-generating process."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of LLaMA-2-7B with LoRA for fine-tuning is a practical choice that balances computational efficiency with model capability. The datasets mentioned (BiasBios, CivilComments, Medical Notes) are accessible, and the evaluation metrics are well-established. The three-stage methodology is clearly defined with concrete steps that could be implemented by researchers with expertise in NLP and causal inference. However, several aspects may present challenges: (1) accurately identifying spurious correlations in complex, high-dimensional text data is non-trivial and may require significant domain expertise, (2) generating high-quality counterfactual examples that maintain semantic coherence while precisely manipulating causal and spurious features is challenging and may require substantial manual verification, (3) the computational resources required for fine-tuning large models with the proposed loss function could be substantial, and (4) the approach assumes access to causal graphs or domain knowledge about spurious correlations, which may not always be available in real-world scenarios."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI: the tendency of large language models to learn spurious correlations that lead to brittleness under distribution shifts. This issue is particularly important in high-stakes domains like healthcare and policy-making, as mentioned in both the proposal and the task description. If successful, the approach could significantly improve the robustness, fairness, and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications. The expected outcomes are substantial and quantified (10-15% improvement in OOD accuracy, 20% decrease in Demographic Parity Difference, 25% improvement on Corr2Cause), indicating meaningful progress on important metrics. The proposal also has broader implications for integrating causal principles into large-scale machine learning, potentially influencing future research directions. While the impact would be significant, it may be somewhat limited by the challenges in scaling the approach to very large models and datasets, and by the difficulty of accurately identifying causal relationships in complex domains without ground truth."
