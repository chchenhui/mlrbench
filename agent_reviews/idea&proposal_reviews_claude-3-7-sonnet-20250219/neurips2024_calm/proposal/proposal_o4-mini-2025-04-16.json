    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of improving large model robustness through causal reasoning, which is central to the task's focus on the synergy between causality and large models. The proposal specifically targets the 'Causality for large models' direction mentioned in the task by applying causal ideas to improve LLMs. The methodology follows the research idea closely by implementing counterfactually guided fine-tuning to steer models away from spurious correlations. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with explicit references to works like Jin et al. (2023), Kıcıman et al. (2023), and others mentioned in the literature review. The proposal's focus on counterfactual consistency and out-of-distribution robustness is well-aligned with the concerns about trustworthiness raised in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with detailed explanations of each component. The causal framework is formally defined with mathematical notation that clarifies the underlying structural causal model. The fine-tuning objective is precisely formulated with appropriate mathematical expressions. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is comprehensively outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact procedure for identifying spurious correlates could be more detailed, (2) the validation process for counterfactual examples could include more specific criteria, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'Corr2Cause benchmark') are mentioned without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with the literature."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel integration of several existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking approach. Its innovation lies in creating a unified pipeline that combines: (1) formal specification of an SCM with both true and spurious paths, (2) automatic generation of textual counterfactuals, and (3) fine-tuning with a counterfactual consistency loss. This combination addresses a gap explicitly identified in the literature review. The counterfactual consistency loss formulation is particularly innovative in how it encourages the model to base predictions on causal rather than spurious features. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing work cited in the literature review, such as counterfactual data augmentation (Doe & Smith, 2023) and fairness fine-tuning (Johnson & Lee, 2023). The proposal acknowledges this by positioning itself as bridging existing approaches rather than creating an entirely new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with a well-founded causal framework. The structural causal model is properly formalized with clear definitions of variables and causal relationships. The counterfactual generation process is methodically described with appropriate validation steps. The fine-tuning objective combines standard cross-entropy with a well-motivated KL divergence term to enforce counterfactual consistency. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical analysis procedures. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the effects of different components. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) the assumption that spurious correlates can be reliably identified may not always hold in complex real-world scenarios, (2) the simplified SCM may not capture all relevant causal relationships in certain domains, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach. Overall, the methodology is rigorous and well-justified, with only minor gaps in theoretical completeness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation requirements. The authors provide concrete algorithmic steps and specify compute resource estimates (fine-tuning a 770M-parameter model for 10 epochs on 4 GPUs over 48 hours), which demonstrates practical consideration of implementation constraints. The datasets mentioned (IMDB+Demo, Biosbias, CivilComments, Corr2Cause) are established benchmarks, making data acquisition straightforward. The counterfactual generation process leverages existing LLM capabilities for text rewriting, which is a practical approach. However, several challenges may affect feasibility: (1) generating high-quality counterfactuals at scale might be difficult and require significant manual validation, (2) identifying true causal variables versus spurious correlates in complex text data could be subjective and error-prone, (3) the computational requirements might be prohibitive for researchers with limited resources, especially when scaling to larger models, and (4) the validation of counterfactual quality using classifiers C_φ and D_ψ assumes these classifiers are reliable, which may not always be the case. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they do introduce implementation complexities that could affect the results."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI: improving the robustness and trustworthiness of large language models by steering them toward causal rather than spurious relationships. This has significant implications for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal systems, and hiring, as mentioned in both the proposal and task description. The expected outcomes include substantial improvements in out-of-distribution accuracy (5-10%) and reductions in fairness gaps, which would represent meaningful progress in the field. The proposed methodology could generalize beyond the specific tasks mentioned to a broader range of NLP applications and potentially extend to multimodal models. The public release of datasets, code, and evaluation benchmarks would provide valuable resources to the research community. The work bridges theoretical causal inference with practical large-scale model training, addressing a key challenge identified in the task description. While the approach is significant, it focuses on fine-tuning rather than pre-training or architectural innovations, which may limit its transformative potential compared to more fundamental redesigns of how LLMs learn."
