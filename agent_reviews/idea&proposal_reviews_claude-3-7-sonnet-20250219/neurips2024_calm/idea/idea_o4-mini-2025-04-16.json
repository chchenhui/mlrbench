        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, particularly with the 'Causality for large models' direction. It directly addresses the challenge of improving large language models' robustness by incorporating causal inductive biases through self-interventional distillation. The proposal tackles the question of 'Under what circumstances can we trust these large models and how can this be improved?' by focusing on reducing spurious correlations and enhancing out-of-distribution generalization. The idea also touches on making models more trustworthy for safety-critical applications, which is explicitly mentioned in the task. However, it doesn't fully address all aspects of the task, such as the interpretability component or the broader question of why large models work so well."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear two-stage framework: intervention generation and distillation with consistency loss. The motivation and expected outcomes are explicitly stated. However, there are some ambiguities that could benefit from further elaboration. For instance, the exact mechanism of 'prompt-based causal probing' to identify latent cause variables is not fully explained. Similarly, the details of the 'contrastive consistency objective' and how the lightweight discriminator works to filter implausible examples could be more precisely defined. These technical details would strengthen the clarity of the implementation approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel approach by combining self-intervention with distillation for improving model robustness. While both interventional approaches and knowledge distillation exist separately in the literature, the self-interventional aspect where the model generates its own counterfactuals for training is innovative. The use of a contrastive consistency objective specifically designed to enforce invariance to non-causal features while maintaining sensitivity to causal changes represents a fresh perspective. The approach is particularly novel in that it creates a scalable pipeline for infusing causal robustness without requiring additional external annotations or data collection, addressing a significant practical challenge in the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate implementation challenges. While the overall framework is conceptually sound, several practical hurdles exist. First, the effectiveness of prompt-based causal probing to accurately identify latent cause variables is uncertain, especially across diverse domains. Second, ensuring the quality of self-generated counterfactuals is challenging - the proposed lightweight discriminator might not be sufficient to filter all implausible examples. Third, designing an effective contrastive consistency objective that properly distinguishes causal from non-causal features requires careful engineering. Additionally, the computational resources needed for distillation of large language models could be substantial. These challenges don't make the idea infeasible, but they do require significant technical expertise and resources to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI trustworthiness - the tendency of large language models to rely on spurious correlations rather than causal relationships. If successful, the approach could significantly improve model robustness under distribution shifts, which is essential for deploying these models in real-world applications, especially in safety-critical domains mentioned in the task description. The scalability of the approach (not requiring additional annotations) makes it particularly impactful for practical applications. Furthermore, the method could provide insights into how causal understanding emerges in large language models, contributing to the broader scientific question of how these models work. The significance is slightly limited by the focus on specific types of robustness rather than a comprehensive solution to all trustworthiness challenges."
