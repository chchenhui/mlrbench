    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea of Causal Mediation Layers aligns excellently with the task description, particularly with the 'Causality for large models' direction. It directly addresses the question of 'how can we trust these large models and how can this be improved?' by proposing a method to identify and rectify spurious correlations in large models. The idea focuses on enhancing robustness under distribution shifts, which is explicitly mentioned as a critical challenge in the task description. The proposal also touches on interpretability aspects, which relates to the 'Causality of large models' direction. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address how large models capture causal knowledge, though it does focus on rewiring non-causal pathways."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly defines the problem (spurious correlations in large models), proposes a specific solution (Causal Mediation Layers), and outlines the implementation approach (identifying problematic sub-networks and introducing intervention-aware layers). The evaluation strategy is also well-articulated, mentioning specific benchmarks. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how exactly the causal mediation analysis would be performed on model sub-networks and how the intervention-aware layers would be implemented in practice. These aspects could benefit from further elaboration, but the overall concept is well-articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to integrating causal reasoning into pre-trained models. While causal inference for improving model robustness isn't entirely new, the specific mechanism of Causal Mediation Layers that identify and rewire non-causal pathways during fine-tuning represents a fresh approach. The combination of counterfactual regularization with pruned causal graphs derived from domain knowledge is particularly innovative. The idea bridges interpretable causality with the scalability needs of large models, which is a relatively unexplored area. It's not completely revolutionary as it builds upon existing concepts in causal inference and model fine-tuning, but it combines these in a novel way that addresses an important gap in current approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. While the high-level approach is sound, implementing causal mediation analysis on complex neural networks is non-trivial. Identifying causal pathways in black-box models remains an open research problem, and the proposal doesn't fully address how to overcome this fundamental challenge. The idea requires domain knowledge for creating pruned causal graphs, which may not be available or complete in all domains. Additionally, the computational resources needed for analyzing and modifying large models could be substantial. That said, the proposal to work with fine-tuning rather than retraining from scratch increases feasibility, and the evaluation on existing benchmarks is practical. The approach could be implemented incrementally, starting with simpler models and controlled environments before scaling to larger models."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in machine learning: the reliance of large models on spurious correlations and their consequent failure under distribution shifts. This is particularly significant for high-stakes domains like healthcare, as mentioned in both the idea and task description. If successful, this approach could substantially improve the trustworthiness and robustness of large models in real-world applications. The potential impact extends beyond performance metrics to include better interpretability through causal pathways, addressing a key concern with black-box models. The approach also offers a middle ground between purely statistical and purely causal methods, potentially creating a new paradigm for model development that balances performance with robustness. The significance is further enhanced by the fact that it doesn't require retraining models from scratch, making it more accessible and practical for widespread adoption."
