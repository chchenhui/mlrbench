        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, specifically addressing point (B) about improving trust in large models. It directly tackles the challenge of distribution shifts mentioned in the task and focuses on enhancing robustness and generalization capabilities through causal mechanisms. The proposal fits squarely within the 'Causality for large models' direction identified in the task description. The idea addresses safety-critical applications like healthcare, which is explicitly mentioned in the task. However, it doesn't engage with all aspects of the task, such as the question of why large models work so well (point A) or the other three directions mentioned (causality in, with, and of large models)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure: motivation, main idea, and expected impact. The proposal outlines a two-step approach (causal discovery followed by regularization) and provides concrete examples like enforcing attention to causal keywords in medical contexts. The validation strategy is also specified. However, some technical details remain ambiguous - the exact causal discovery methods to be used are only vaguely described as 'invariant prediction frameworks,' and the specific regularization techniques to align model attention with causal features could be more precisely defined. The proposal would benefit from more explicit formalization of how the causal structure learning would be integrated with the training process of large language models."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel integration of causal inference with large language model training through regularization. While both causal discovery and regularization techniques exist separately, their combination specifically for improving LLM robustness represents an innovative approach. The concept of using causally-informed regularization to guide model attention toward stable causal relationships rather than spurious correlations is particularly fresh. The field has seen work on causal inference in machine learning and some work on robustness in LLMs, but the specific mechanism proposed here - using causal structure to inform regularization during fine-tuning - appears to be a novel contribution that could open new research directions. It's not entirely revolutionary as it builds on existing methods, but it combines them in a new and potentially impactful way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. First, causal discovery in high-dimensional, unstructured text data is notoriously difficult and often requires strong assumptions. The proposal mentions using invariant prediction frameworks, but applying these to large language models with billions of parameters presents significant computational and methodological hurdles. Second, translating discovered causal relationships into effective regularization terms requires careful design to avoid degrading model performance. The validation approach using synthetic benchmarks with known causal graphs is reasonable, but creating realistic synthetic data with controlled causal structures for language tasks is non-trivial. The idea is implementable in principle, but would require substantial methodological innovations and computational resources to execute effectively. It's a challenging but not impossible research direction."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in AI: ensuring reliable performance under distribution shifts. The significance is particularly high because: 1) It targets a fundamental limitation of current deep learning approaches - their reliance on spurious correlations; 2) It has direct implications for high-stakes applications like healthcare where robustness is essential; 3) If successful, it would provide a principled approach to improving generalization beyond empirical techniques like data augmentation; 4) The approach could enhance interpretability by highlighting causal features, addressing another major concern with large models; 5) The work bridges the gap between theoretical causal inference and practical deep learning, potentially influencing both fields. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical deployment considerations for large language models in critical domains."
