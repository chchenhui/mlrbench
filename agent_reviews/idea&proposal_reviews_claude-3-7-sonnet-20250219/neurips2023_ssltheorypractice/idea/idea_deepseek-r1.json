        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the theoretical foundations of SSL by developing sample complexity bounds, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest in the task description. The proposal aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing guidelines for selecting SSL methods based on data availability, which is the central theme of the workshop. The idea also covers comparative analysis between contrastive and non-contrastive approaches, which aligns with the workshop's interest in comparative analyses of different SSL approaches. The validation across multiple modalities (vision, language, time-series) also matches the workshop's broad scope across data types."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (understanding sample complexity of SSL methods), the approach (developing theoretical bounds for contrastive vs. non-contrastive methods), and the expected outcomes (guidelines for method selection). The methodology involving statistical learning theory and experimental validation is outlined concisely. However, the specific theoretical tools and mathematical frameworks to be employed could be more precisely defined. While the general direction is clear, some technical details about how the bounds will be derived and what specific metrics will be used to measure convergence rates could benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong originality by focusing on a critical but understudied aspect of SSL: sample complexity bounds that differentiate between contrastive and non-contrastive paradigms. While sample complexity analysis exists in machine learning broadly, its application to compare these specific SSL paradigms appears novel. The proposal innovatively connects theoretical bounds with practical guidelines across multiple modalities, which is a fresh approach. The research doesn't merely analyze existing methods but aims to develop a theoretical framework that could inspire new algorithms optimized for sample efficiency. The comparative aspect between the two dominant SSL paradigms adds another layer of novelty, as most theoretical works focus on a single approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate challenges. The theoretical component requires expertise in statistical learning theory and a deep understanding of SSL methods, which is demanding but achievable. The experimental validation across multiple modalities (vision, language, time-series) is ambitious and resource-intensive but can be scoped appropriately. The connection between theoretical bounds and empirical performance may be challenging to establish conclusively, as real-world factors often complicate theoretical predictions. The proposal would benefit from more details on how to handle the complexity of modern SSL architectures in theoretical analysis. Overall, the idea is implementable with sufficient expertise and computational resources, though it may require careful scoping to ensure completion."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical gap in SSL understanding that has significant practical implications. Sample complexity bounds would provide practitioners with concrete guidance on data requirements, potentially saving substantial computational resources and enabling SSL in data-scarce domains. The theoretical insights could lead to more efficient algorithm design, particularly important as SSL expands to new domains and applications. By comparing contrastive and non-contrastive methods, the research could resolve ongoing debates in the field about method selection. The multi-modal validation enhances the impact by making the findings applicable across different data types. This work could fundamentally change how researchers and practitioners approach SSL method selection and implementation, making it highly significant to the field."
