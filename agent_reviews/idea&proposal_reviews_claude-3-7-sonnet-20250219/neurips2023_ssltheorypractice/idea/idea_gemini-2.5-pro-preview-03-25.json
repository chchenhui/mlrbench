        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the comparative analysis of SSL and supervised approaches, which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest. The proposal aims to characterize the practical advantages of SSL in challenging scenarios (data scarcity and domain shift), which addresses the question posed in the task description: 'practically, where do self-supervised models shine compared to traditional supervised models?' The idea focuses on empirical evaluation rather than theoretical foundations, but this is still within the scope of the workshop which invites both theoretical and empirical works."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (understanding SSL's practical advantages), the approach (systematic empirical comparison varying labeled data quantity and domain shift), and the expected outcome (a quantitative map of conditions where SSL excels). The methodology is described concisely but comprehensively. The only minor ambiguity is in the specifics of how domain shift will be quantified and varied, and what exact metrics will be used to measure 'significant robustness and generalization advantages.' These details would need further elaboration in a full proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers a fresh perspective by systematically mapping the performance landscape of SSL versus supervised learning across two critical dimensions (data scarcity and domain shift). While comparative analyses between SSL and supervised learning exist, the comprehensive nature of this study and its focus on creating a 'quantitative map' of conditions where SSL excels appears novel. The approach doesn't introduce fundamentally new SSL methods or theoretical frameworks, but rather provides a novel empirical characterization that could significantly impact how researchers and practitioners choose between SSL and supervised approaches in real-world scenarios."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current resources and technology. It relies on established SSL and supervised learning methods, and the experimental setup (varying labeled data quantity and introducing domain shifts) is straightforward to implement. The necessary datasets for image classification and NLP tasks are readily available, and techniques for creating controlled domain shifts are well-documented in the literature. The computational requirements, while potentially substantial for comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks and conditions, are within the capabilities of standard research computing infrastructure. The methodology is clear and doesn't require the development of new theoretical frameworks or algorithms."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important gap in our understanding of SSL's practical utility. While SSL has shown impressive benchmark performance, the conditions under which it provides meaningful advantages over supervised learning remain unclear. By systematically mapping these conditions, the research could provide valuable guidance to practitioners on when to invest in SSL pre-training versus purely supervised approaches. This has significant implications for resource allocation in real-world ML deployments, especially in domains with limited labeled data or potential distribution shifts. The work could also inform future SSL research by highlighting scenarios where current methods fall short, potentially inspiring targeted improvements."
