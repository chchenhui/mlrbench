        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the theoretical foundations of SSL, which is a primary focus of the task. The proposal specifically tackles the question of 'why certain auxiliary tasks in SSL perform better than others' - a question explicitly mentioned in the task description. The idea also incorporates information theory and SSL, comparative analysis of different auxiliary tasks, and proposes a theoretical framework that could inform practical applications across multiple domains (vision, language, graphs), all of which are topics listed in the task description. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address sample complexity, though it does mention 'theoretical bounds on representation learning efficiency' which is related."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation is well-articulated, identifying a clear knowledge gap in SSL research. The main idea introduces specific concepts like the 'task alignment spectrum' and explains how the framework will quantify relationships between auxiliary tasks and downstream tasks using mutual information metrics. The proposal outlines a logical progression from theoretical development to empirical validation across multiple domains. While the overall direction is clear, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, how exactly the 'task alignment spectrum' will be mathematically formulated, or what specific metrics will be used to measure representation quality. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to SSL theory. While information-theoretic approaches to understanding SSL exist, the proposed 'task alignment spectrum' appears to be a novel conceptual framework for systematically analyzing auxiliary tasks. The focus on developing theoretical bounds specifically for auxiliary task performance is relatively unexplored territory. The integration of theoretical analysis with practical guidelines for task design across multiple domains represents a fresh perspective. However, information-theoretic analyses of representation learning are not entirely new, and some aspects of the proposal build upon existing theoretical frameworks, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents some challenges. The theoretical component of developing an information-theoretic framework is achievable with existing mathematical tools. The empirical validation across multiple domains (vision, language, graphs) is ambitious but doable with sufficient computational resources. However, deriving theoretical bounds that are both mathematically rigorous and practically useful is notoriously difficult in deep learning. The connection between theoretical bounds and practical guidelines may require significant refinement to be truly actionable. Additionally, validating the framework across diverse domains will require substantial expertise and resources. These challenges are significant but not insurmountable, justifying a good but not excellent feasibility score."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental gap in SSL understanding that has significant implications. If successful, it would transform auxiliary task design from an art based on intuition to a science based on theoretical principles. This could dramatically accelerate progress in SSL across domains by reducing trial-and-error experimentation. The potential to reduce computational resources needed for effective SSL has important practical implications for democratizing access to advanced ML techniques. The framework could also provide insights into representation learning more broadly. The work directly addresses the theory-practice gap highlighted in the task description and could influence both theoretical understanding and practical applications of SSL, making it highly significant to the field."
