    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the theoretical foundations of SSL by developing sample complexity bounds for contrastive and non-contrastive methods, which is a core topic mentioned in the task description. The proposal follows through on the main idea of comparing these two SSL paradigms and investigating how factors like augmentation strength, network architecture, and latent space geometry affect data requirements. The literature review is well-integrated, with the proposal building upon Hieu et al.'s (2024) generalization bounds, Garrido et al.'s (2022) duality framework, Balestriero & LeCun's (2022) spectral embedding perspective, and Chen et al.'s (2020) empirical analysis. The proposal addresses all key challenges identified in the literature review and extends across multiple modalities as suggested in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are precisely defined with mathematical formulations of the contrastive and non-contrastive losses, along with the expected sample complexity bounds. The methodology section provides a comprehensive two-pronged approach combining theoretical derivations with empirical validation. The algorithmic implementation is detailed with pseudocode and specific architectural choices for different modalities. The experimental design is thoroughly explained with datasets, evaluation metrics, and control experiments. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact relationship between the theoretical bounds and the empirical validation could be more explicitly connected, (2) some mathematical notations (e.g., covering numbers of augmentation sets) are introduced without full explanation, and (3) the transition between theoretical derivations and practical implementations could be smoother."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by developing a unified theoretical framework for comparing sample complexity bounds between contrastive and non-contrastive SSL methods, which hasn't been comprehensively addressed in prior work. The integration of Rademacher complexity arguments with augmentation complexity and network architecture parameters is innovative. The cross-modal validation approach spanning vision, language, and time-series data is also relatively novel. However, the core techniques build upon existing statistical learning theory and the individual components (contrastive/non-contrastive losses, evaluation metrics) are well-established in the literature. The proposal extends and combines existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. While the unified framework and cross-modal validation are fresh contributions, the theoretical tools and empirical methods largely follow established practices in the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical approaches. The use of Rademacher complexity for deriving generalization bounds is mathematically rigorous and appropriate for the task. The formulation of contrastive and non-contrastive losses is technically correct, and the derivation of sample complexity bounds follows established statistical learning theory principles. The experimental methodology is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, metrics, and control experiments. The proposal includes statistical validation with multiple seeds and significance testing. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the assumptions about spectral gaps in the target operator for non-contrastive learning could be more thoroughly justified, (2) the connection between the theoretical bounds and the empirical slopes could be more rigorously established, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential limitations or edge cases where the theoretical framework might not apply."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined theoretical and empirical components. The theoretical framework builds on established techniques in statistical learning theory, and the proposed experiments use standard datasets and architectures. The unified codebase approach ensures comparability between methods. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) the computational resources required for training across multiple modalities and data size regimes could be substantial, especially for the larger datasets like ImageNet and WikiText-103; (2) deriving tight bounds that accurately predict empirical behavior is notoriously difficult in deep learning; (3) the proposal aims to cover three different modalities with different architectures, which increases implementation complexity; and (4) the control experiments that vary architecture depth/width and augmentation strength will multiply the computational requirements. While ambitious, the proposal is generally realistic with appropriate resources, though the timeline and resource requirements could have been more explicitly addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in SSL research by providing theoretical foundations for empirical observations and practical guidelines for method selection. Understanding sample complexity is particularly valuable for resource-constrained applications in healthcare, robotics, and remote sensing. The cross-modal approach ensures broad applicability across domains. The expected outcomes include precise theoretical bounds, empirical validation, practical guidelines, and an open-source library, all of which would make substantial contributions to the field. The work bridges theory and practice, which directly addresses a core challenge identified in the task description. The potential impact extends beyond academic understanding to practical deployment considerations, resource allocation, and algorithm design. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on existing SSL paradigms rather than proposing fundamentally new approaches, and the practical guidelines might need to be adapted for specific domain applications."
