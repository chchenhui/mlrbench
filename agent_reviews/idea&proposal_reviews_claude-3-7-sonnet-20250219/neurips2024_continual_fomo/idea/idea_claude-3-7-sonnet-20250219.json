    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the workshop's focus on scalable continual learning for foundation models. It directly addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in FMs when fine-tuned on smaller datasets, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposed adaptive knowledge pruning framework specifically targets efficient updating of foundation models without complete retraining, which is a central concern of the workshop. The idea also considers computational efficiency and practical deployment, which aligns with the workshop's emphasis on scalability. The only minor limitation in consistency is that while the proposal mentions experiments across language and vision domains, it doesn't explicitly address some other workshop topics like multi-modal learning systems or integration with structured knowledge sources."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (catastrophic forgetting in FMs), the limitations of current approaches (memory-intensive storage or limited adaptation), and proposes a specific three-part solution (importance scoring, adaptive pruning, and sparse fine-tuning). The framework's mechanism for creating a hierarchical knowledge structure is well-explained. The evaluation approach is also outlined, comparing against traditional methods across domains. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, the specific metrics for importance scoring, the exact pruning criteria, and how the sparse fine-tuning would be implemented. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. While pruning, importance scoring, and sparse fine-tuning are established techniques in machine learning, their integration into a dynamic framework specifically for continual learning in foundation models represents an innovative approach. The concept of creating a hierarchical knowledge structure that differentiates between fundamental and task-specific knowledge is particularly novel. However, the approach builds significantly on existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods, and similar concepts of selective parameter updating have been explored in parameter-efficient fine-tuning literature. The novelty lies more in the application context and integration than in completely new algorithmic innovations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. The components of the approach (importance scoring, pruning, and sparse fine-tuning) all have established implementations in the literature that could be adapted. The evaluation methodology comparing against traditional fine-tuning is straightforward and implementable. The computational efficiency focus actually makes this more feasible than approaches requiring extensive resources. The main implementation challenges would likely be in developing effective importance metrics that truly distinguish fundamental from task-specific knowledge, and in ensuring that the pruning doesn't inadvertently remove critical pathways. These challenges are substantial but surmountable with careful experimentation, making this a highly feasible research direction."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in the deployment and maintenance of foundation models. If successful, it could dramatically reduce the computational and environmental costs of keeping large models up-to-date with new knowledge. The significance is particularly high given the increasing size of foundation models and the growing need to adapt them to specific domains without losing their general capabilities. The approach could potentially bridge the gap between parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and full model retraining, offering a middle ground that preserves critical knowledge while allowing meaningful updates. The impact would extend across multiple domains where foundation models are deployed, including NLP, computer vision, and potentially multimodal systems, making this a highly significant contribution to the field."
