        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on scalable continual learning for foundation models. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the task description: avoiding retraining large models (via knowledge graph updates), addressing catastrophic forgetting (through external knowledge structures), handling domain shifts and long-tailed distributions (explicitly mentioned in the evaluation plan), and combining FMs with structured knowledge sources (the core of the proposal). The idea specifically targets the workshop's central concern of enabling foundation models to efficiently update without complete retraining, which is a primary focus of the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined approach called Knowledge-Guided Continual Learning (KG-CL). The proposal clearly explains the mechanism (dynamic knowledge graph interface), the training process (alternating between graph updates and GNN finetuning), and expected outcomes. The technical components are well-specified, including the use of GNNs, contrastive learning, and lightweight adapters. While the overall concept is clear, some implementation details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific architecture of the GNN layers and how exactly the knowledge graph would be initialized and structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining knowledge graphs with continual learning for foundation models in a structured way. While both knowledge graphs and continual learning are established research areas, their integration specifically for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in foundation models represents a fresh approach. The concept of using external knowledge structures as persistent memory to decouple knowledge acquisition from model parameters is innovative. However, retrieval-augmented learning and knowledge graph integration with neural networks have been explored in other contexts, so the novelty lies more in the specific application and implementation for continual learning rather than introducing entirely new technical concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. The core components (knowledge graphs, GNNs, foundation models) are well-established technologies, making the basic approach implementable. However, efficiently integrating large-scale knowledge graphs with foundation models presents significant engineering challenges. The proposal mentions lightweight adapters and selective parameter updates, which are practical approaches to reduce computational costs. Questions remain about scaling the knowledge graph to accommodate the vast knowledge in foundation models, maintaining graph quality over time, and ensuring efficient retrieval from the graph during inference. The alternating training procedure may also require careful tuning to prevent instability."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in AI: enabling foundation models to efficiently update without complete retraining. If successful, this approach could significantly reduce the computational resources and carbon footprint associated with keeping foundation models current, which is a major concern in the field. The potential for 'prompt-free' updates via graph edits could transform how foundation models are maintained and deployed in production environments. The approach could be particularly impactful for domains requiring frequent updates with specialized knowledge (healthcare, legal, scientific research), where current foundation models struggle. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's focus on practical metrics like computational efficiency and backward transfer."
