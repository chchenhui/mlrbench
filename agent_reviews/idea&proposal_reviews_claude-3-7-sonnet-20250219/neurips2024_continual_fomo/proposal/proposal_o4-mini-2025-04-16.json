    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable continual learning for foundation models, particularly the questions about avoiding retraining, addressing catastrophic forgetting, handling domain shifts, and combining FMs with structured knowledge sources. The proposal builds upon the literature review by extending concepts from K-Adapter, Linked Adapters, and incremental LoRA KG embeddings into a comprehensive framework. The methodology section thoroughly details how the dynamic KG-infused adapters work, with clear connections to the cited literature while introducing novel components like sparse subgraph retrieval and periodic graph consolidation. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines from the literature review and addresses the evaluation protocol concerns mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical flow with appropriate technical detail. The system overview provides a clear high-level understanding, followed by detailed explanations of each component. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly in sections 2.2-2.5 where the KG construction, adapter architecture, and learning objectives are described. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-specified datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for how the KG embeddings are updated during training could be more explicit, (2) the interaction between the adapter regularization and KG loss could be further elaborated, and (3) some implementation details regarding the KG extraction pipelines could be more specific."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. While individual components like knowledge graph embeddings, adapter-based fine-tuning, and continual learning have been explored separately, the integration of these elements into a cohesive framework is innovative. Specifically, the dynamic maintenance of a knowledge graph that evolves alongside adapter parameters, the cross-attention mechanism between adapter layers and KG embeddings, and the sparse subgraph retrieval for computational efficiency represent novel contributions. The proposal extends beyond existing work like K-Adapter (which uses static knowledge) and incremental LoRA KG embeddings (which focuses on KG learning rather than foundation model adaptation) by creating a bidirectional interaction between the evolving KG and the adapter modules. The periodic consolidation mechanism to control KG growth is also a novel approach to maintaining efficiency in a continual learning setting. While building on established techniques, the proposal recombines them in a way that addresses unique challenges in scalable continual learning."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The adapter architecture with KG cross-attention is well-formulated mathematically, and the learning objectives incorporate appropriate regularization terms to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The KG embedding approach using TransE or ComplEx is grounded in proven techniques. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the relationship between KG consolidation frequency and forgetting is not theoretically analyzed, (2) the choice of similarity threshold for node merging seems somewhat ad hoc without clear justification, and (3) the interaction between the adapter regularization and the KG embedding loss could be more rigorously formulated. Additionally, while the sparse subgraph retrieval is practical, the theoretical guarantees on retrieval quality and its impact on learning are not fully developed. The experimental design is comprehensive, but some of the anticipated results (e.g., \"â‰¥90% of cumulative accuracy\") would benefit from preliminary evidence or stronger theoretical backing."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with careful consideration of computational efficiency. The use of adapter modules (updating <5% of parameters) and sparse subgraph retrieval demonstrates awareness of resource constraints when working with foundation models. The implementation details section specifies reasonable model choices, adapter ranks, and optimization strategies. However, several practical challenges may affect feasibility: (1) The quality of entity and relation extraction from diverse data types (text, images, multimodal) varies significantly and may introduce noise into the KG, (2) The computational overhead of maintaining and querying the KG during training, even with sparse retrieval, could be substantial for very large datasets, (3) The periodic graph consolidation process might introduce instabilities if not carefully implemented, and (4) The approach requires significant engineering effort to integrate across different modalities. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they do introduce implementation complexity that could affect the timeline and resources needed for successful execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in foundation model development: enabling efficient continual learning without catastrophic forgetting or prohibitive computational costs. If successful, this work could significantly impact both research and practical applications of foundation models. The scientific contributions are substantial: (1) a novel framework combining structured knowledge with neural adaptation, (2) techniques for dynamic knowledge maintenance in continual learning settings, and (3) insights into the interplay between symbolic and subsymbolic representations. The practical significance is equally compelling, potentially enabling real-time update pipelines for deployed models that can adapt to new information while preserving core capabilities. The approach is generalizable across modalities (language, vision, multimodal) and applicable to various domains where knowledge evolves over time (e.g., medical, legal, news). The anticipated reduction in computational resources (50% fewer GPU hours) would also have significant environmental and economic benefits. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and provides a convincing case for the work's significance."
