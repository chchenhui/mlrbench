    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable continual learning for foundation models, particularly the challenges of catastrophic forgetting, domain shifts, and efficient adaptation without full retraining. The proposal incorporates knowledge graphs as structured knowledge sources (explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics) and presents a parameter-efficient approach using adapters. The methodology builds upon the literature review, specifically extending concepts from K-Adapter, I2I, and incremental LoRA papers. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets that test domain shifts and long-tailed distributions as mentioned in the workshop topics. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions multimodal applications, it could have more explicitly addressed the workshop's interest in 'seamless integration of CL and multi-modal learning systems'."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical components are explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The adapter architecture with cross-attention is well-defined, as are the dynamic knowledge graph construction, sparse retrieval mechanism, and graph consolidation strategy. The training protocol and experimental design are comprehensively outlined. Figures are referenced (though not visible in the provided text) to aid understanding. The only areas that could benefit from further clarification are: (1) more details on how the domain-specific ontology for triplet extraction works in practice, (2) clearer explanation of how the periodic graph consolidation is triggered and executed during training, and (3) more specific details on the implementation of the sparse retrieval mechanism."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty by combining several existing concepts in a unique way. While adapters and knowledge graphs have been explored separately in the literature, the integration of dynamic knowledge graphs with cross-attention adapters for continual learning represents a novel approach. The sparse retrieval mechanism and graph consolidation strategy are innovative solutions to the scalability challenges in continual learning. The proposal builds upon existing work (K-Adapter, I2I, incremental LoRA) but extends them in meaningful ways, particularly through the dynamic updating of the knowledge graph and the cross-attention mechanism for selective knowledge infusion. The approach to handling domain shifts and long-tailed distributions through knowledge graph reasoning is also innovative. However, some individual components (like adapters and knowledge graph embeddings) are established techniques, which slightly reduces the overall novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with clear theoretical underpinnings and rigorous mathematical formulations. The adapter architecture with cross-attention is technically correct, and the dynamic knowledge graph construction follows established principles. The training protocol is logical and comprehensive. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential issues with knowledge graph quality and coverage - what happens if the extracted triplets are noisy or incomplete? (2) The graph consolidation strategy relies on similarity thresholds without clear justification for how these thresholds should be set. (3) While the sparse retrieval mechanism is described, its theoretical guarantees for maintaining performance are not fully established. (4) The proposal mentions but doesn't fully elaborate on how the approach handles conflicting information in the knowledge graph. These gaps, while not critical, somewhat reduce the overall soundness of the proposal."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally feasible with current technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The adapter-based approach is practical and has been demonstrated in prior work, making the parameter-efficient aspect highly feasible. The knowledge graph construction and embedding techniques build on established methods. The experimental design uses existing datasets and metrics, which is realistic. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The dynamic extraction of high-quality triplets from diverse inputs may be challenging in practice, especially for domain-specific knowledge. (2) The computational overhead of maintaining and querying a growing knowledge graph, even with sparse retrieval, could become significant over time. (3) The graph consolidation strategy might be difficult to optimize without introducing new forms of forgetting. (4) The proposal doesn't fully address the potential scalability issues when the number of tasks grows very large. These challenges don't render the approach infeasible, but they do suggest that additional engineering work would be needed for a robust implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning: enabling foundation models to continually learn without catastrophic forgetting or prohibitive computational costs. If successful, this approach could significantly impact how large models are updated and maintained in production environments. The expected outcomes include substantial improvements in backward transfer, parameter efficiency, and generalization to domain-shifted and long-tailed data - all crucial challenges in real-world applications. The proposal bridges important research gaps between continual learning, knowledge infusion, and efficient adaptation. The practical applications in healthcare, legal NLP, and potentially other domains are compelling and address real needs. The interdisciplinary connections to neuroscience and AutoML add further significance. The main limitation to the significance is that the approach is primarily focused on supervised learning scenarios, and may not fully address other important continual learning settings like reinforcement learning or self-supervised learning, which somewhat narrows its potential impact."
