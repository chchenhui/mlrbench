    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's key questions about developing general defense methods against diverse backdoor attacks across domains (CV, NLP, FL) and potentially extending to unseen domains like RL. The proposed MetaShield framework faithfully implements the core idea of a meta-learning approach for domain-agnostic backdoor detection with few-shot adaptation capabilities. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, referencing specific papers to justify design choices and positioning the work within the current research landscape. For example, it acknowledges TextGuard's domain-specific limitations [Ref 1], builds on insights about backdoor-critical layers [Ref 2], and addresses the challenge of detecting stealthy attacks like those in BELT [Ref 4]. The only minor inconsistency is that while the research idea mentions 'synthetic triggers,' the proposal could have elaborated more specifically on the synthetic trigger generation process."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. It follows a logical progression from background and motivation through methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and well-defined. The technical approach is presented with appropriate mathematical formalism that makes the meta-learning process understandable. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are comprehensively outlined. Diagrams or visual representations of the framework would have enhanced clarity further, but the textual explanation is strong. There are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for extracting and processing activations from different model architectures could be more detailed, (2) the proposal could more explicitly address how the meta-learning approach handles the potentially different dimensionality and characteristics of features across domains, and (3) the adaptation process for completely novel domains could be elaborated further. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is high, making the research approach readily comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly novel approach to backdoor detection through several innovative aspects. First, the cross-modal meta-learning framework for backdoor detection represents a significant departure from traditional domain-specific defenses. While meta-learning has been explored for backdoor detection (Ref [6], Ref [10]), the proposal's emphasis on cross-domain generalization and few-shot adaptation with only clean samples is particularly innovative. The approach of learning a domain-agnostic representation of backdoor signatures in activation spaces is conceptually novel and addresses a critical gap in current defenses. The proposal also innovates by requiring only clean samples for adaptation, unlike many existing methods that need triggered examples or extensive clean datasets. While building on established meta-learning techniques (MAML), the application to backdoor detection across modalities and the specific design of the anomaly detector represent meaningful innovations. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more novel technical components beyond the application of MAML to this problem domain."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall. The meta-learning approach is well-grounded in established techniques (MAML), and the mathematical formulation of the learning process is correct. The hypothesis that backdoors induce anomalous patterns in model activations across domains is reasonable and supported by prior work. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering multiple domains, attack types, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where the technical foundations could be strengthened: (1) The proposal assumes that backdoor signatures manifest similarly in activation spaces across different domains, which may not always hold true - this assumption needs more theoretical justification; (2) The method for calibrating detection thresholds using only clean samples might be challenging in practice, especially for completely novel domains; (3) The proposal doesn't fully address how the approach would handle adversarial adaptations where attackers specifically design triggers to evade the meta-learned detector. While these concerns don't invalidate the approach, they represent areas where the technical soundness could be improved with additional analysis or mitigation strategies."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The meta-learning framework builds on established techniques (MAML) and uses standard datasets and model architectures that are readily available. The computational requirements, while substantial for meta-training across multiple domains, are within the capabilities of modern research infrastructure. The experimental design is practical and well-structured. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) Creating a diverse and representative set of backdoor attacks across multiple domains for meta-training is labor-intensive and may require significant expertise; (2) The effectiveness of the approach relies on the assumption that backdoor signatures share common characteristics across domains, which may not hold universally; (3) The few-shot adaptation process might face challenges with completely novel domains or highly sophisticated backdoor attacks; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address the potential computational overhead of activation extraction and analysis at deployment time, which could be significant for large models. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent practical hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in machine learning security with potentially far-reaching impact. As noted in the task description, backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to deployed ML systems, especially as pre-trained models become increasingly prevalent. The proposed MetaShield framework offers a solution to several key challenges: (1) It provides a domain-agnostic approach that could generalize across CV, NLP, FL, and potentially to emerging domains like RL; (2) It requires minimal clean data for adaptation, making it practical for real-world deployment scenarios where clean data may be scarce; (3) It potentially addresses unseen attack types through meta-generalization, offering proactive rather than reactive defense. The significance is further enhanced by the growing importance of securing large pre-trained models that are increasingly deployed in critical applications. If successful, this research could substantially advance the state of backdoor defense, enabling more trustworthy deployment of ML systems across domains. The proposal directly addresses multiple key questions from the workshop call, particularly around developing general defense methods and understanding cross-domain connections between attacks and defenses."
