    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the key challenge of developing 'a general defense method against a variety of backdoor attacks and even unseen attacks' mentioned in the task description. The proposal's focus on cross-modal detection that works across CV, NLP, and FL domains perfectly matches the research idea of creating a 'meta-learning framework that acquires a domain-agnostic backdoor signature detector.' The methodology incorporates concepts from the literature review, including addressing stealthy attacks like ReVeil and BELT, and builds upon meta-learning approaches for backdoor detection. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges of data efficiency and adaptability to unseen attacks identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The meta-training and testing phases are well-defined, with clear explanations of how the system works. The evaluation protocol is comprehensive, specifying datasets, baselines, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for extracting and normalizing features across different modalities could be more detailed, (2) the proposal could better explain how the meta-learned detector handles the dimensional differences between CV, NLP, and FL feature spaces, and (3) some technical details about the anomaly detector's architecture could be more specific."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach to backdoor detection through its cross-modal meta-learning framework. While meta-learning has been applied to backdoor detection before (as mentioned in the literature review), MetaShield's domain-agnostic approach that generalizes across CV, NLP, and FL is novel and addresses a significant gap in current research. The few-shot calibration mechanism that requires minimal clean data is particularly innovative. The proposal also introduces a novel way to extract universal backdoor signatures from diverse domains. However, some individual components (like using activation patterns for detection) build upon existing techniques, though they are combined in a new way. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by highlighting its cross-domain capabilities, which most existing methods lack."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-founded and builds on established techniques in meta-learning (MAML) and anomaly detection. The mathematical formulations are correct and the methodology is logically structured. The approach of using penultimate layer activations as backdoor signatures is supported by prior work. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the assumption that backdoor signatures share common patterns across domains needs more theoretical support, (2) the proposal doesn't fully address how the detector handles the dimensional differences between different model architectures, and (3) the calibration process using only clean samples (without triggered examples) could be more rigorously justified. While the overall approach is sound, these theoretical gaps slightly reduce the score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The meta-learning approach using MAML is well-established, and the lightweight detector design ensures computational efficiency. The datasets and benchmarks mentioned are accessible, and the evaluation protocol is realistic. The few-shot calibration requirement (≤50 clean samples) is reasonable and practical for real-world scenarios. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) generating diverse synthetic backdoor attacks across multiple domains will require significant engineering effort, (2) ensuring consistent feature extraction across vastly different model architectures may be challenging, and (3) the performance targets (TPR ≥90% across domains) are ambitious given the diversity of backdoor types. While these challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that will require careful implementation and possibly some adjustments to the approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning security that has substantial real-world implications. A domain-agnostic backdoor detector would be a major advancement in the field, addressing the limitations of current domain-specific approaches highlighted in the literature review. The potential impact is significant across multiple dimensions: (1) technical impact through cross-modal detection capabilities, (2) practical impact through lightweight design suitable for edge devices, and (3) societal impact by enhancing trust in AI systems and potentially influencing regulatory frameworks. The proposal's focus on few-shot adaptation makes it particularly valuable for organizations using pre-trained models with limited data access. If successful, MetaShield could become a standard tool for backdoor detection across diverse ML applications, representing a substantial contribution to the field."
