    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's question of developing 'a general defense method against a variety of backdoor attacks and even unseen attacks' by creating a domain-agnostic backdoor detection system. The Cross-Modal MetaShield framework follows the main idea outlined in the research idea, implementing a meta-learning approach that works across CV, NLP, and FL domains. The proposal acknowledges the limitations of current domain-specific defenses highlighted in the literature review and addresses key challenges like adaptability to unseen attacks and data efficiency. The methodology section thoroughly explains how the framework will extract universal backdoor signatures from model activations, which is consistent with the meta-learning approach mentioned in the idea. The proposal also incorporates relevant concepts from the literature review, such as few-shot learning for backdoor detection and cross-domain transferability concerns."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem formulation to methodology and expected outcomes. The introduction effectively establishes the context and motivation for the research. The methodology section is particularly strong, providing detailed explanations of the meta-learning procedure, feature extraction approach, and experimental design. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented, making the technical aspects accessible. The problem is formally defined with appropriate notation, and the cross-modal approach is explained thoroughly. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for generating synthetic triggers across different domains could be more detailed, (2) the transformation function Ïˆ for creating unified representations could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some technical details about the anomaly detection module's implementation are somewhat vague. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The Cross-Modal MetaShield framework presents significant novelty in several aspects. First, it introduces a genuinely domain-agnostic approach to backdoor detection, which addresses a critical gap in current research where defenses are typically domain-specific. Second, the application of meta-learning to extract universal backdoor signatures across different domains (CV, NLP, FL) is innovative and not well-explored in existing literature. Third, the dimension-agnostic feature transformation to create unified representations across different model architectures is a novel technical contribution. The proposal also introduces the concept of few-shot adaptation for backdoor detection, requiring minimal clean data for deployment. While meta-learning itself is not new, and some papers in the literature review mention meta-learning for backdoor detection, this proposal's comprehensive cross-domain approach and specific technical implementations represent a substantial advancement over existing methods. The integration of these components into a unified framework that can generalize across domains and adapt to unseen attack patterns distinguishes this work from prior research."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall. The meta-learning approach is well-grounded in established MAML methodology, and the mathematical formulations for the inner and outer loop updates are technically correct. The feature extraction process from model activations has theoretical justification, as activation patterns have been shown to reveal backdoor signatures in prior work. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering multiple domains, attack types, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical foundations for why backdoor signatures should be consistent across domains need more rigorous development; (2) the proposal assumes that penultimate layer activations will contain universal backdoor signatures, but this assumption requires stronger justification; (3) while the dimension-agnostic feature transformation is innovative, its effectiveness across dramatically different architectures (e.g., transformers vs. CNNs) needs more theoretical support. The evaluation protocol is thorough, but more details on statistical significance testing would enhance rigor. Overall, while the approach is technically sound, some theoretical aspects could be more deeply developed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The Cross-Modal MetaShield framework presents a feasible research direction with reasonable implementation requirements. The meta-learning approach builds on established techniques like MAML, and the feature extraction from model activations is practically implementable. The proposal's strength lies in its practical considerations: the detector is designed to be lightweight, requiring minimal computational resources for adaptation, and the few-shot learning approach addresses real-world constraints of limited clean data availability. The experimental design uses standard benchmarks and models that are readily available. However, several challenges may affect feasibility: (1) creating a truly unified representation across dramatically different architectures (CV vs. NLP models) may be more difficult than anticipated; (2) generating diverse and representative backdoor scenarios for meta-training is labor-intensive and may not cover all possible attack variations; (3) the effectiveness of the approach on very large models (e.g., foundation models) is uncertain and may face computational constraints. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the project infeasible, but rather represent important research questions to be addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is exceptionally high, addressing a critical security vulnerability in machine learning systems. As the proposal correctly identifies, backdoor attacks represent a persistent threat to deployed ML models, and current defenses remain largely domain-specific and limited in their generalizability. The development of a domain-agnostic backdoor detection system would have immediate practical impact across multiple industries and applications. The few-shot adaptation capability is particularly significant, as it addresses the real-world constraint of limited clean data availability. The cross-domain nature of the approach could unify currently disparate research streams on backdoor defenses, potentially establishing new theoretical foundations for understanding backdoor vulnerabilities. The proposal's focus on practical deployment considerations enhances its significance, as it could be readily integrated into existing ML pipelines and model verification workflows. If successful, this research would substantially advance the state of ML security, contributing to more trustworthy AI systems in critical applications like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and financial services."
