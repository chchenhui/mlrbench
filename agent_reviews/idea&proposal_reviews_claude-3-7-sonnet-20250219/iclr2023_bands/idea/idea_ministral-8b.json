    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns very well with the task description. It directly addresses the cross-domain analysis of backdoor attacks and defenses across CV, NLP, and FL, which is explicitly mentioned as a gap in the task description. The proposal aims to identify common patterns, develop cross-domain defenses, evaluate stealthiness, and create a general defense framework - all of which are key questions highlighted in the task description. The only minor limitation is that while the task mentions exploring backdoors in other domains like binary analysis tools and reinforcement learning, the proposal primarily focuses on CV, NLP, and FL without explicitly mentioning these additional domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented in a clear and structured manner. The motivation is well-articulated, and the methodology is broken down into four concrete steps with specific objectives. The expected outcomes and potential impact are also clearly stated. However, there could be more specificity about the technical approaches that will be used to identify common patterns across domains and how exactly the general defense framework will be constructed. While the overall direction is clear, some implementation details remain somewhat abstract."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea of conducting a cross-domain analysis of backdoor attacks is relatively novel. As noted in both the research idea and task description, while extensive research has been conducted in individual domains (CV, NLP, FL), the connections between these domains remain largely unexplored. The proposal to develop a general defense framework that can be applied across domains and to unseen attacks is innovative. However, the individual components (analyzing backdoor attacks, developing defenses, evaluating stealthiness) are extensions of existing research directions rather than completely new concepts. The novelty lies primarily in the cross-domain integration rather than in fundamentally new techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. Analyzing backdoor attacks across different domains is certainly achievable, as is evaluating existing defense techniques. However, developing a general defense framework that works across domains and against unseen attacks is ambitious and technically challenging. Different domains have distinct data structures, model architectures, and attack vectors, making unified defenses difficult to achieve. The proposal doesn't specify how it will overcome these domain-specific challenges or what technical approaches will be used to create cross-domain defenses. While not impossible, this would require significant expertise across multiple domains and potentially novel theoretical insights to be fully successful."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is high. As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in critical applications, backdoor attacks pose a serious security threat. The task description explicitly highlights the concerns with publicly available pre-trained models and the limitations of existing defense techniques. A successful cross-domain analysis could substantially advance our understanding of backdoor vulnerabilities and lead to more robust defense mechanisms. The potential impact on enhancing security and trustworthiness of AI systems is considerable. The research addresses a pressing need in the field and could influence how models are secured across multiple domains, though its immediate practical implementation might face challenges."
