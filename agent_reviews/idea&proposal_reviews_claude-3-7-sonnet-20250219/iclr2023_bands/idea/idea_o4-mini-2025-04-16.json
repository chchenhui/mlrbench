        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The MetaShield idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing the core challenge of developing a general defense method against various backdoor attacks across different domains. It specifically targets the question 'How can we develop a general defense method against a variety of backdoor attacks and even unseen attacks?' The proposal spans multiple domains (CV, NLP, FL) as highlighted in the task description and aims to create a unified detector that can generalize to unseen tasks and trigger types. The cross-modal approach directly addresses the need for defense techniques that can be adapted across domains, which is a key topic in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The meta-learning approach is explained concisely, detailing how it extracts latent activations from target models and trains anomaly detectors. The deployment process is also clearly described, explaining how the system fine-tunes on clean samples to calibrate detection thresholds. While the overall concept is clear, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific meta-learning algorithm to be used, how the anomaly detection works across different modalities, and what metrics will be used to evaluate performance across domains. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The MetaShield approach is highly innovative in several ways. First, it introduces a meta-learning framework specifically for backdoor detection, which is a novel application in this security domain. Second, the cross-modal nature of the detector is groundbreaking, as most existing backdoor defenses are domain-specific (as noted in both the proposal and task description). Third, the ability to adapt to unseen trigger patterns with minimal clean data represents a significant advancement over current approaches that often require extensive data or knowledge of trigger patterns. The meta-learning approach to capture 'universal backdoor irregularities' across modalities is particularly innovative and addresses a critical gap in current defense mechanisms. The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that it builds upon existing meta-learning and anomaly detection techniques, though it combines them in a novel way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents several implementation challenges. Meta-learning frameworks exist and have been applied to various domains, and extracting latent activations from models is a standard practice. However, creating a truly domain-agnostic detector that works across CV, NLP, and FL presents significant challenges due to the fundamental differences in data representations and model architectures across these domains. The proposal doesn't fully address how these differences will be reconciled in the meta-learning framework. Additionally, the few-shot adaptation claim requires empirical validation, as backdoor patterns can be extremely diverse. The requirement of only clean samples for fine-tuning is practical but may limit detection performance for sophisticated backdoors. Overall, while implementable, the approach would require considerable engineering effort and may face challenges in achieving the claimed generalization capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is substantial. As noted in the task description, 'with the wide adoption of large pre-trained models in real-world applications, any injected malicious behaviors, such as backdoors in those models, are particularly concerning.' MetaShield directly addresses this critical security concern by proposing a unified defense mechanism. If successful, it would provide a practical, plug-and-play defense applicable to multiple domains, significantly enhancing the security of machine learning systems. The ability to detect backdoors with minimal clean data would be particularly valuable for real-world deployment scenarios where obtaining large clean datasets is challenging. The cross-modal nature of the approach also advances the theoretical understanding of backdoor attacks by identifying common signatures across domains, which aligns with the workshop's goal of exploring 'the similarities and differences of backdoor attacks in various tasks.'"
