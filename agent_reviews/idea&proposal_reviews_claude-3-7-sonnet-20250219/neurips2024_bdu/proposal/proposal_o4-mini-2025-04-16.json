    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on Bayesian decision-making and uncertainty quantification by proposing a framework that leverages LLMs to elicit informative priors for Bayesian Optimization. The proposal builds upon the cited literature (AutoElicit, LLAMBO, LLANA) and addresses the key challenge of prior specification in BO, which is highlighted in both the task description and research idea. The methodology section clearly outlines how LLMs will be used to translate natural language descriptions into GP priors, which is precisely what was suggested in the research idea. The experimental design includes synthetic benchmarks, hyperparameter tuning, and scientific discovery applications, which align with the workshop's mentioned application areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The problem formulation is precise, with well-defined mathematical notation for the BO framework. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the LLM-based prior elicitation process, including prompt engineering, structured output parsing, and hyperprior construction. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying benchmarks, baselines, evaluation metrics, and implementation details. The expected outcomes are clearly stated. The only minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more specific details on how the LLM outputs will be validated before being used as priors, and (2) clearer explanation of how the approach will handle potential inconsistencies or errors in LLM-generated priors."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to using LLMs for prior elicitation in Bayesian Optimization. While the literature review indicates that similar ideas have been explored (e.g., AutoElicit, LLAMBO, LLANA), this proposal offers several innovative aspects: (1) a structured pipeline for translating natural language into specific GP kernel choices and hyperparameter ranges, (2) a systematic framework for constructing hyperpriors from LLM outputs, and (3) comprehensive evaluation across diverse domains. However, the core concept of using LLMs to enhance BO is not entirely new, as evidenced by the cited works. The proposal incrementally advances existing approaches rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The Bayesian Optimization framework is correctly formulated with appropriate mathematical notation. The GP prior specification and posterior updates follow standard practices in the field. The ElicitPrior function and the LLM-BO-Prior algorithm are well-defined and theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical analysis procedures. The approach for converting LLM outputs into hyperpriors (using log-normal distributions calibrated to match suggested ranges) is mathematically justified. The only minor limitation is the lack of theoretical guarantees or analysis of how LLM-elicited priors might affect the convergence properties of BO, which would strengthen the theoretical soundness of the approach."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current technology and resources. All components of the methodology rely on existing tools and frameworks: GPT-4 for LLM inference, GPyTorch and BoTorch for GP and BO implementation. The experimental design is realistic and well-scoped, with clearly defined benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The implementation details specify the required computational resources (GPU-accelerated API servers for LLM inference, CPU cluster for BO experiments). The approach of using structured JSON-like outputs from LLMs makes parsing and integration straightforward. The evaluation on synthetic benchmarks, hyperparameter tuning, and scientific discovery tasks is practical and achievable within a reasonable timeframe. The 20 independent seeds for statistical significance is a reasonable number that balances rigor with computational constraints."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important challenge in Bayesian Optimization: the specification of informative priors, which is critical for sample efficiency in expensive black-box optimization problems. By democratizing BO for non-experts and potentially reducing the number of function evaluations by 10-50%, the approach could have substantial impact in scientific discovery domains where each evaluation is costly (e.g., materials screening, drug discovery). The broader impact section convincingly argues for the proposal's significance in democratizing Bayesian methods, accelerating scientific discovery, and advancing trustworthy AI. The integration of LLMs with Bayesian decision-making represents an important direction at the intersection of two powerful paradigms. However, while the impact could be substantial in specific domains, it may not be transformative across the entire field of AI or machine learning, which is why it doesn't receive the highest significance score."
