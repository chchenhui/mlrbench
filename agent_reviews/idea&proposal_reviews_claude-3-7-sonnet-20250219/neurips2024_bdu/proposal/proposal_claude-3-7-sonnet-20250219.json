    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on Bayesian decision-making and uncertainty quantification by proposing a novel approach to enhance Bayesian Optimization through improved prior elicitation. The proposal thoroughly elaborates on the core idea of using LLMs to generate informative priors from natural language problem descriptions, which matches perfectly with the initial research idea. The methodology section comprehensively covers all aspects mentioned in the idea, including the process of eliciting structural and parametric priors, and evaluating the approach on benchmark and real-world problems. The proposal also acknowledges and builds upon the existing literature, particularly referencing similar approaches like LLAMBO while extending beyond them with a more comprehensive framework for prior elicitation. The only minor inconsistency is that some of the cited papers in the literature review appear to be fictional (with future dates and placeholder authors), but the proposal itself addresses the key themes and challenges identified in the genuine literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and motivation, while the methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the LLM-PEBO framework with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design is thoroughly described, including benchmark functions, real-world applications, baseline methods, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly delineated. The use of subsections, mathematical notation, and clear definitions of components enhances readability. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact prompting strategy for the LLM could be more explicitly defined with examples, (2) The feedback integration mechanism could be explained in more detail with specific algorithms, and (3) Some technical details about the implementation of the GP surrogate model and hyperparameter adaptation are somewhat abstract. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a comprehensive framework for LLM-guided prior elicitation in Bayesian Optimization. While the core idea of using LLMs to enhance BO is not entirely new (as evidenced by papers like LLAMBO in the literature review), LLM-PEBO offers several novel contributions: (1) The systematic approach to both structural and parametric prior elicitation, (2) The feedback integration mechanism that refines priors based on initial optimization results, (3) The comprehensive experimental design across diverse domains, and (4) The focus on interpretability of the elicited priors. The proposal distinguishes itself from prior work by emphasizing the translation of qualitative domain knowledge into quantitative priors, rather than just using LLMs for candidate suggestion or surrogate modeling. However, it builds upon existing concepts in both BO and LLM application areas rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The methodology is built on well-established principles of Gaussian Process regression and Bayesian Optimization, with clear mathematical formulations for the prior elicitation process. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate benchmark functions, real-world applications, baseline comparisons, and evaluation metrics that align with standard practices in the field. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and includes ablation studies to assess the contribution of different components. The feedback integration mechanism provides a safeguard against potential inaccuracies in LLM-elicited priors. The technical formulations for GP surrogate modeling and acquisition function optimization are correct and clearly presented. However, there are a few areas where additional rigor could be beneficial: (1) More detailed discussion of the theoretical guarantees for the proposed approach, (2) More specific methods for validating the quality of LLM-generated priors, and (3) More rigorous treatment of the potential biases in LLM outputs and how they might affect optimization performance."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach that can be implemented with current technologies and methods. Both Bayesian Optimization and Large Language Models are mature technologies with established libraries and frameworks. The experimental design is realistic and includes appropriate benchmark functions and real-world applications. The evaluation metrics are standard and measurable. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect the feasibility score: (1) The computational resources required for running large language models alongside Bayesian Optimization could be substantial, especially for real-time applications, (2) The quality of LLM-generated priors depends heavily on the quality and relevance of the LLM's training data, which may be limited for highly specialized scientific domains, (3) The feedback integration mechanism requires careful design to avoid overfitting to early observations, and (4) The interpretability of LLM outputs and their translation into mathematical priors may require significant engineering effort. Despite these challenges, the proposal outlines a reasonable implementation plan with appropriate ablation studies and baseline comparisons, making it largely feasible with existing technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in Bayesian Optimization - the challenge of specifying informative priors, especially for non-experts or in complex domains. By leveraging LLMs to translate natural language problem descriptions into quantitative priors, the research has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and accessibility of BO across various domains. The expected impact is substantial: (1) Improved sample efficiency could lead to significant cost savings in domains with expensive function evaluations, such as drug discovery or materials science, (2) The democratization of advanced optimization techniques by lowering the barrier to entry for domain experts without statistical expertise, (3) Enhanced automation of scientific workflows through more efficient experimental design, and (4) Contributions to both Bayesian Optimization methodology and applications of LLMs in scientific computing. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and provides a convincing case for the significance of the research. While the approach may not be transformative for all applications (particularly those where function evaluations are cheap or where domain knowledge is limited), it addresses a critical bottleneck in many high-value scientific and engineering optimization tasks."
