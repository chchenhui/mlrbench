    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on integrating eye-gaze data with machine learning. It directly addresses the workshop's call for 'unsupervised ML using eye gaze information for feature importance/selection' and 'annotation and ML supervision with eye-gaze.' The proposal leverages eye-gaze as a cost-efficient supervision signal to reduce reliance on labeled data, which is a core theme of the workshop. The neuro-symbolic approach also connects to the workshop's interest in bridging human cognition and AI. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions validation on tasks like image classification, it could have more explicitly addressed some of the application domains mentioned in the workshop description (e.g., AR/VR, autonomous driving)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a structured framework with clear components: gaze metrics collection, symbolic reasoning modules, neural attention training, and reinforcement learning for dynamic feature selection. The workflow and expected outcomes (40-50% label reduction) are well articulated. The motivation and potential impact are clearly communicated. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific mechanisms for translating gaze patterns into feature importance scores, the exact formulation of the reinforcement learning objective, and how the symbolic reasoning modules will be designed for different domains. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The neuro-symbolic approach to feature selection using eye-gaze data represents a fresh integration of cognitive science with machine learning. While eye-tracking has been used in ML before, the combination of symbolic reasoning to encode domain-specific rules with neural attention and reinforcement learning creates a novel framework. The dynamic adjustment of feature selection during training based on gaze alignment is particularly innovative. The approach isn't entirely unprecedented—researchers have explored eye-tracking for feature importance—but the comprehensive framework that bridges neuroscience principles with ML techniques in this specific manner appears to be original. The score reflects strong innovation while acknowledging that individual components build upon existing research directions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally feasible but faces some implementation challenges. Eye-tracking technology is mature and accessible, and the machine learning components (neural attention, reinforcement learning) are well-established. However, several practical hurdles exist: (1) collecting quality eye-tracking data at scale requires specialized equipment and controlled environments; (2) translating gaze patterns into reliable feature importance signals involves addressing noise and individual variations in viewing patterns; (3) designing effective symbolic reasoning modules for different domains requires domain expertise; and (4) the reinforcement learning component may face training stability issues when balancing multiple objectives. These challenges are surmountable with appropriate resources and expertise, but they represent non-trivial implementation considerations that prevent a higher feasibility score."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant problem in machine learning—reducing reliance on labeled data while improving model interpretability. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) practical utility in reducing annotation costs by 40-50%; (2) scientific value in connecting human cognitive processes with machine learning; (3) methodological contribution through the neuro-symbolic framework; and (4) applications in critical domains like medical imaging. The approach could influence how we think about human-in-the-loop machine learning and weak supervision. The significance is somewhat limited by the need for eye-tracking equipment, which may restrict widespread adoption, and by the fact that the improvements might be incremental rather than transformative in some application domains. Nevertheless, the idea addresses core challenges in modern ML with a thoughtful, interdisciplinary approach."
