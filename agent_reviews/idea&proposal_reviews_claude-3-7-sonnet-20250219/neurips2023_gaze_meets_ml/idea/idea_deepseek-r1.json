        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on integrating eye gaze data with machine learning. It specifically addresses the topic of 'Unsupervised ML using eye gaze information for feature importance/selection' mentioned in the workshop description. The proposal also touches on applications in radiology, which is explicitly listed as a domain of interest. The idea further connects to other workshop themes including annotation with eye-gaze, attention mechanisms, and explainable AI. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some of the broader topics like ethics or human-AI interaction, though these could be natural extensions of the work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (lack of prioritization of clinically relevant regions in unsupervised learning), the proposed solution (using eye-tracking data to guide feature importance), and the expected outcomes (improved anomaly detection and interpretable attention maps). The methodology involving contrastive learning between gaze-attended and non-attended regions is well-defined. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific implementation details - for example, exactly how the contrastive losses would be formulated, or how the approach would handle temporal aspects of gaze data. These are reasonable omissions for a research proposal but prevent it from receiving the highest clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining eye-tracking data with self-supervised learning in the medical imaging domain. While both eye-tracking in radiology and self-supervised learning exist separately, their integration for feature prioritization represents a fresh approach. The use of gaze patterns as a form of weak supervision without requiring explicit annotations is particularly innovative. However, similar concepts have been explored in adjacent domains (e.g., using gaze for saliency prediction or attention guidance in computer vision), which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score. The application to medical imaging specifically, with its unique challenges and high-stakes outcomes, does provide a novel angle to this research direction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is moderately feasible but faces some implementation challenges. The primary concern is the availability and quality of large-scale eye-tracking datasets in radiology. While the proposal mentions these datasets, collecting high-quality eye-tracking data from radiologists at scale would require significant resources and coordination with medical institutions. Technical challenges also exist in aligning the temporal nature of gaze data with static image features and designing effective contrastive learning objectives. The computational requirements for processing both high-resolution medical images and gaze data could be substantial. These challenges are surmountable with appropriate resources and expertise, but they do represent meaningful hurdles to implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant problem in medical AI - the need for models that focus on clinically relevant features without extensive manual annotation. If successful, this approach could substantially improve the performance and trustworthiness of AI systems in radiology by aligning them with expert attention patterns. The potential impact extends beyond performance metrics to clinical adoption, as models that demonstrably focus on the same regions as radiologists may inspire greater trust. The approach could also generalize to other medical imaging domains and potentially to other fields where expert visual attention carries meaningful information. The significance is slightly limited by the specialized nature of the application, but within medical AI, this represents an important contribution."
