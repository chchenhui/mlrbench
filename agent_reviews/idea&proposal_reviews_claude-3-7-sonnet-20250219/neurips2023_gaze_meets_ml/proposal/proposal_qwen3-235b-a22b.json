    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on gaze-assisted machine learning in the medical domain, particularly leveraging eye gaze for unsupervised feature learning. The proposal builds upon the cited literature (McGIP, FocusContrast, GazeGNN) while identifying their limitations (reliance on predefined thresholds or auxiliary networks). It maintains consistency with the original research idea of using radiologists' gaze patterns for self-supervised learning in medical imaging, and expands on it with detailed methodology. The proposal also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as variability in gaze patterns and integration complexity, through its adaptive attention module and modular architecture design."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with logical progression from background to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and numbered for easy reference. The technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance precision. The methodology section provides detailed algorithmic steps, including loss functions and architectural components. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the dual-branch Siamese network and the attention mechanism could be more explicitly explained; (2) Figure 1 is referenced but not provided in the proposal; and (3) Some technical terms (e.g., DBSCAN) are used without brief explanations, which might be challenging for readers unfamiliar with these techniques."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a novel framework that directly incorporates radiologists' gaze patterns into the feature learning process. While it builds upon existing gaze-guided contrastive learning approaches like McGIP and FocusContrast, it offers several innovative elements: (1) The attention-guided feature modulation technique that explicitly contrasts attended vs. non-attended regions; (2) The integration of gaze data without preprocessing into binary masks; (3) The dual-branch architecture with a dedicated gaze-guided attention module; and (4) The application to both CNN and transformer backbones. However, the core concept of using gaze data for contrastive learning in medical imaging has been explored in the cited literature, particularly in McGIP and FocusContrast. The proposal refines and extends these approaches rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and sound methodological foundations. The mathematical formulations for gaze preprocessing, attention-guided feature modulation, and contrastive loss functions are well-defined and theoretically grounded. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (both gaze-agnostic and gaze-guided), comprehensive evaluation metrics, and thoughtful ablation studies to isolate the contribution of different components. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and includes ethical considerations. The technical approach builds logically on established contrastive learning frameworks while adapting them to incorporate gaze data. However, there are some minor concerns: (1) The proposal could benefit from more detailed justification for the choice of loss function weights (λ1, λ2); (2) The mechanism for sampling negative examples from non-attended regions could be more precisely defined; and (3) The statistical validation approach (bootstrapping with p < 0.05) is mentioned but not fully elaborated."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it requires specialized resources. The datasets mentioned (OpenI, MIMIC-CXR, NIH ChestX-ray14) are publicly available, and eye-tracking technology is mature enough to collect the necessary gaze data. The computational requirements, while substantial, are within the capabilities of modern research infrastructure. The modular architecture design allows for incremental development and testing. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) Collecting comprehensive eye-tracking data from radiologists across multiple institutions may be logistically complex; (2) The private retinal imaging dataset mentioned would require IRB approval and data sharing agreements; (3) The proposed performance improvements (≥5% increase in AUC-ROC, >85% accuracy in few-shot learning) are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve consistently across different imaging modalities; and (4) The integration of gaze data into both CNN and transformer architectures may require significant engineering effort to optimize."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in medical AI: the scarcity of labeled data and the high cost of expert annotations. By leveraging radiologists' natural gaze patterns as a form of weak supervision, the approach could substantially reduce annotation burden while improving model performance and interpretability. The potential impacts are well-articulated and compelling: (1) Cost reduction in AI development for radiology; (2) Enhanced generalization in low-data regimes; (3) Improved model interpretability through alignment with expert visual reasoning; and (4) Potential applications across diverse imaging modalities. The proposal also has broader implications for global health equity by enabling accurate diagnostics in resource-limited settings. The cross-disciplinary nature of the work, bridging cognitive science and machine learning, adds to its significance. While the immediate impact may be focused on the medical imaging domain, the principles could extend to other areas where expert visual attention is valuable."
