    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on integrating eye gaze into machine learning, particularly in the medical domain. The proposal builds upon the cited literature (McGIP, FocusContrast, GazeGNN) while extending these approaches with novel gaze-guided attention mechanisms and contrastive learning techniques. The methodology section thoroughly details how radiologists' gaze patterns will be leveraged as a form of weak supervision for self-supervised learning, which is precisely what was outlined in the research idea. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges mentioned in the literature review, such as limited gaze datasets and inter-reader variability, and proposes solutions to address these issues."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, with precise mathematical formulations for the Gaze-Guided Attention Module (GGAM) and Gaze-Weighted Contrastive Loss (GWCL). The preprocessing steps, training protocol, and evaluation metrics are all explicitly defined. The figures referenced (though not visible in the provided text) would likely enhance understanding. There are a few minor areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more details on how the gaze data collection will be standardized across different radiologists to account for inter-reader variability, and how the approach would generalize to other imaging modalities beyond chest X-rays. Overall, however, the proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing two key innovations: (1) the Gaze-Guided Attention Module that injects continuous gaze priors into feature extraction, and (2) the Gaze-Weighted Contrastive Loss that enforces embedding similarity for gaze-attended regions. While it builds upon existing work in gaze-guided contrastive learning (McGIP, FocusContrast), it advances beyond these approaches by treating gaze not merely as a pair-selection signal but as a continuous attention prior that dynamically steers feature learning. The integration of gaze weights directly into the network architecture is a fresh perspective. However, the core concept of using gaze data to guide self-supervised learning in medical imaging has been explored in the cited literature, which somewhat limits the groundbreaking nature of the proposal. The novelty lies more in the specific implementation and integration techniques rather than in an entirely new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for the GGAM and GWCL are well-defined and appear correct. The approach logically extends established contrastive learning frameworks by incorporating gaze information in a principled manner. The training protocol, including optimizer choice, learning rate schedule, and hyperparameters, is well-justified and follows best practices in self-supervised learning. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, covering classification performance, anomaly detection, and interpretability metrics. The ablation studies are thoughtfully designed to isolate the contributions of different components. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, such as inter-reader variability in gaze patterns. One minor concern is that the effectiveness of the gaze gating mechanism might depend on the quality and consistency of the eye-tracking data, which could introduce variability in model performance. Overall, however, the approach is methodologically sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it does present some implementation challenges. The use of established datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert) and eye-tracking technology (Tobii Pro Glasses 3) is practical. The computational requirements, while substantial, are within the capabilities of modern GPU clusters. The timeline is reasonable, allocating sufficient time for data collection, implementation, evaluation, and publication. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) collecting additional eye-tracking data from 5 board-certified radiologists reading 5,000 images each is ambitious and may face recruitment and scheduling challenges; (2) the quality and consistency of gaze data across different radiologists may vary significantly, potentially affecting model performance; (3) the integration of gaze information into transformer architectures might require architectural modifications beyond what is described. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with current resources and technology, particularly given the 12-month timeline."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in medical AI: the need for models that align with clinical reasoning without extensive manual annotations. By leveraging radiologists' gaze patterns as a form of weak supervision, the approach could significantly reduce the annotation burden while improving model performance and interpretability. The expected outcomes—improved classification accuracy, enhanced anomaly detection, and interpretable attention maps—would have meaningful clinical impact if achieved. The potential to generalize the methodology to other imaging modalities and medical specialties further enhances its significance. The proposal also contributes to the broader field of human-AI interaction by demonstrating how physiological signals can guide machine learning. The emphasis on interpretability and trust is particularly valuable in the medical domain, where model transparency is crucial for clinical adoption. While not completely transformative of the field, the proposal has the potential to make a substantial contribution to medical AI research and practice."
