    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on integrating eye gaze into machine learning, particularly in the medical imaging domain. The proposal expands on the initial idea of using radiologists' gaze patterns for self-supervised learning by developing a comprehensive framework (GazAT) that incorporates attention transfer mechanisms. It builds upon the literature review by citing and extending works like McGIP and FocusContrast, addressing the identified challenges such as limited labeled data and the need for interpretability. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges mentioned in the literature review, including variability in gaze patterns and privacy concerns."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, with mathematical formulations that precisely define the proposed methods. The gaze-to-attention conversion process, contrastive learning architecture, and attention transfer mechanisms are all thoroughly described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) some of the mathematical notations could be better explained for broader accessibility, (2) the distinction between the regional contrastive loss and the standard contrastive loss could be more explicitly stated, and (3) the experimental design section could provide more specific details about the evaluation protocols."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. While it builds on existing work in gaze-guided learning (McGIP, FocusContrast), it introduces several innovative components: (1) the multi-level attention transfer mechanism that aligns model attention with human gaze at multiple scales, (2) the regional contrastive loss that specifically targets high-attention areas, and (3) the gaze-guided augmentation strategy that preserves diagnostically relevant regions. The combination of these elements into a unified framework represents a novel approach that goes beyond simply using gaze data as positive pairs (as in McGIP) or for augmentation guidance (as in FocusContrast). However, the core concept of using eye-tracking data for self-supervised learning in medical imaging has been explored in prior work, which slightly limits the novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-founded and builds on established theoretical foundations in contrastive learning and attention mechanisms. The mathematical formulations for the various loss functions and attention map generation are technically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger justification: (1) the choice of specific distance functions for attention alignment is not fully justified, (2) the hyperparameters for balancing the different loss components lack empirical validation, and (3) the proposal doesn't thoroughly address potential biases that might be introduced by relying on radiologists' gaze patterns, which could vary based on experience level or training background. Additionally, while the approach to convert gaze data to attention maps is reasonable, alternative approaches could have been discussed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and resources, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of existing datasets like REFLACX provides a practical starting point, and the proposed methods build on established deep learning techniques. The implementation details are well-specified, including network architectures, optimization strategies, and training schedules. However, several feasibility concerns exist: (1) the limited availability of eye-tracking datasets across different medical imaging modalities may restrict generalizability, (2) collecting new eye-tracking data from 5-10 radiologists examining 100-200 images each could be resource-intensive and face recruitment challenges, (3) the computational requirements for the multi-level attention transfer and regional contrastive learning might be substantial, and (4) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the scalability challenges of eye-tracking data collection."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in medical image analysis: the need for models that align with clinical reasoning while reducing annotation burden. The significance is high for several reasons: (1) it offers a pathway to incorporate domain expertise into AI systems without explicit annotations, potentially reducing the cost and time required for developing medical AI, (2) the approach could lead to more interpretable and trustworthy AI systems in healthcare, addressing a major barrier to clinical adoption, (3) the methodology could generalize to other domains where expert visual attention provides valuable signals, and (4) the interdisciplinary nature of the work bridges computer vision, cognitive science, and medical imaging. The potential clinical impact is substantial, as the resulting models could serve as assistive tools for radiologists, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency while also providing educational value for training junior practitioners."
