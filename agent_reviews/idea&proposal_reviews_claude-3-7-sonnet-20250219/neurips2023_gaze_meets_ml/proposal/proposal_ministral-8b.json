    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on integrating eye gaze into machine learning, specifically targeting unsupervised ML using eye gaze for feature importance in medical imaging. The proposal builds upon the literature review by extending concepts from papers like McGIP and FocusContrast, while maintaining the core idea of using radiologists' gaze patterns to guide feature learning. The methodology section clearly outlines how eye-tracking data will be used for contrastive learning, which is consistent with the original idea. The proposal also addresses several topics of interest mentioned in the task description, including annotation and ML supervision with eye-gaze, attention mechanisms, and applications in radiology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction provides sufficient background and context, while the methodology section outlines a detailed approach with specific algorithmic steps. The mathematical formulations for contrastive and auxiliary contrastive losses are clearly presented. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The distinction between the contrastive loss and auxiliary contrastive loss could be more explicitly defined, as they appear to have the same mathematical formulation; (2) The proposal could provide more details on the specific neural network architectures to be used (e.g., which transformer or CNN variants); and (3) The validation section could elaborate on the specific baseline models for comparison. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is logically structured and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining eye-tracking data with self-supervised learning for medical imaging. While the literature review shows that similar approaches exist (e.g., McGIP and FocusContrast), this proposal introduces several novel elements: (1) The focus on feature prioritization rather than just contrastive learning; (2) The introduction of an auxiliary contrastive loss specifically designed to contrast gaze-attended vs. non-attended regions; and (3) The emphasis on generating interpretable attention maps that mirror expert focus. However, the core technique of using gaze data for contrastive learning in medical imaging has been explored in the cited literature, which somewhat limits the novelty. The proposal extends existing approaches rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, placing it in the 'good' rather than 'excellent' category for novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established machine learning principles. The contrastive learning approach is based on solid theoretical foundations, and the integration of eye-tracking data is logically justified. The mathematical formulations for the loss functions are correct, and the experimental design includes appropriate evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges the need for validation across multiple datasets to assess generalizability. However, there are a few areas that could strengthen the technical rigor: (1) The proposal could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential biases in eye-tracking data and how these might be mitigated; (2) While the contrastive learning approach is well-defined, the proposal could elaborate on how the model will handle cases where radiologists' gaze patterns might focus on non-pathological areas; and (3) The threshold value for defining significant fixations in ROI extraction could be more rigorously defined. Despite these minor limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it does present some implementation challenges. The use of eye-tracking technology and contrastive learning are well-established approaches, and the proposed methodology builds on existing frameworks. However, several practical considerations affect its feasibility: (1) As noted in the literature review, collecting comprehensive eye-tracking datasets from radiologists is resource-intensive, which could limit the scope of the research; (2) The proposal acknowledges the need for data anonymization but doesn't fully address how to handle the variability in gaze patterns among different radiologists; (3) The computational resources required for training transformer-based models on large medical imaging datasets could be substantial. Despite these challenges, the proposal outlines a realistic approach with manageable risks, particularly if the researchers have access to existing eye-tracking datasets. The experimental design is practical, and the evaluation metrics are standard in the field, making the overall implementation feasible with appropriate resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important challenge in medical imaging AI: the need for extensive labeled datasets. By leveraging radiologists' eye-tracking data as a form of weak supervision, the approach could significantly reduce the annotation burden while improving model performance and interpretability. The potential impacts are substantial and well-articulated: (1) Reducing data annotation costs in medical imaging, which is particularly valuable in low-resource settings; (2) Enhancing the interpretability of AI systems by aligning model attention with expert focus; (3) Improving anomaly detection accuracy in unsupervised settings; and (4) Contributing to the advancement of self-supervised learning techniques in medical imaging. These contributions could have meaningful implications for clinical practice, particularly in settings where labeled data is scarce. The proposal also aligns with broader trends toward more efficient and interpretable AI in healthcare. While the impact may be primarily limited to the medical imaging domain rather than transforming AI more broadly, the significance within this domain is considerable."
