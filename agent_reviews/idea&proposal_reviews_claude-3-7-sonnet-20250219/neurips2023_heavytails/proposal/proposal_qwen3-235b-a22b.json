    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of repositioning heavy-tailed behavior as an expected and beneficial characteristic rather than a negative phenomenon. The Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification (HTGA) framework precisely implements the idea of leveraging heavy-tailed stochastic gradients for improved generalization. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant concepts like Wasserstein stability bounds, normalized SGD, and high-probability convergence guarantees. It also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as optimization stability and generalization behavior. The experimental methodology is comprehensive and includes comparisons with baseline approaches mentioned in the literature (SGD, NSGD, gradient clipping, TailOPT). The proposal successfully integrates the workshop topics including heavy tails in stochastic optimization, edge of stability, and power-laws in ML."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The HTGA framework is explained in detail, including its three primary components: tail-index estimator, adaptive gradient amplification mechanism, and update rule. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented, with clear notation and explanations. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are thoroughly described, providing a comprehensive understanding of how the framework will be validated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the tail-index estimator and the specific amplification function could be more explicitly justified, (2) the transition between theoretical guarantees and practical implementation could be more seamless, and (3) some technical details about the adaptive thresholding mechanism for preventing divergence could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly novel approach to handling heavy-tailed distributions in machine learning. While previous work has focused on mitigating or normalizing heavy-tailed gradient noise (as seen in the literature review), HTGA takes the innovative step of actively amplifying and leveraging this behavior to improve exploration and generalization. The dynamic adjustment of gradient updates based on tail-index estimates represents a fresh perspective that challenges conventional wisdom. The proposal introduces several original contributions: (1) a real-time tail-index estimator adapted for non-stationary training dynamics, (2) a gradient amplification mechanism that scales updates based on heavy-tailedness, and (3) an adaptive thresholding approach to maintain stability. The framework's integration of extreme value theory with optimization algorithms is particularly innovative. However, some elements build upon existing concepts like normalized SGD and gradient clipping, which slightly reduces the overall novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations, drawing appropriately from extreme value theory, stochastic differential equations, and optimization principles. The mathematical formulation of the tail-index estimator and gradient scaling mechanism is technically sound. The connection to existing literature on Wasserstein stability bounds and high-probability convergence guarantees provides a solid theoretical grounding. However, there are some areas where the theoretical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithm are mentioned but not fully developed, (2) the relationship between the tail-index and generalization performance relies somewhat on empirical observations rather than rigorous theoretical analysis, and (3) the stability of the adaptive thresholding mechanism could benefit from more formal analysis. The experimental methodology is well-designed, with appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics, but would be strengthened by more specific details on statistical significance testing and robustness checks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clear implementation steps. The computational procedure for HTGA is well-defined, with specific formulas for tail-index estimation, gradient scaling, and parameter updates. The experimental design includes realistic datasets and model architectures, and the evaluation metrics are standard and measurable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) real-time estimation of tail indices during training could introduce significant computational overhead, especially for large models, (2) the window-based approach for gradient collection requires additional memory, which might be limiting for resource-constrained environments, and (3) the sensitivity of the Hill estimator to parameter choices might require careful tuning. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges and suggests monitoring computational overhead, but could provide more detailed strategies for addressing these potential limitations. The integration with existing optimization frameworks seems practical, though the adaptation to distributed settings might require additional considerations not fully elaborated in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in machine learning optimization and has the potential for significant impact across multiple domains. By reframing heavy-tailed behavior as a beneficial feature rather than a problem to be mitigated, it could lead to a paradigm shift in how the community approaches optimization algorithms. The practical benefits of improved generalization, particularly in low-data regimes, would be valuable for many real-world applications. The theoretical contributions, including new convergence guarantees and insights into the relationship between heavy-tailed dynamics and generalization, could advance our understanding of deep learning fundamentals. The proposal also has broader implications for distributed learning, privacy-preserving mechanisms, and scaling laws in large models, aligning perfectly with the workshop's interdisciplinary goals. The framework could serve as a foundation for future research at the intersection of probability theory, dynamical systems, and machine learning optimization, potentially influencing algorithm design across the field."
