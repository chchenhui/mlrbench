        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of repositioning heavy tails as an expected and potentially beneficial aspect of machine learning rather than a 'phenomenon' to be mitigated. The proposed Heavy-Tail Gradient Amplification (HTGA) framework perfectly embodies the research idea of leveraging heavy-tailed stochastic gradients for improved generalization. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works on heavy-tailed SGD, algorithmic stability, and generalization bounds. It builds upon existing approaches like gradient clipping and normalization while proposing a novel direction of amplifying rather than suppressing heavy tails. The methodology addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly optimization stability and generalization behavior."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction provides comprehensive background and context, while the problem statement clearly identifies the research gap. The methodology section is particularly strong, with detailed explanations of the online tail index estimation and the HTGA algorithm, including mathematical formulations. The experimental design is well-planned with appropriate datasets, models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the relationship between the tail index and generalization could be more explicitly defined with concrete examples, (2) the computational overhead of the online tail index estimation could be more thoroughly addressed, and (3) some technical details about handling edge cases (e.g., when gradient norms are very small) could be elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly original approach to optimization in deep learning. While existing methods like gradient clipping and normalization aim to mitigate the effects of heavy tails, HTGA takes a fundamentally different perspective by actively leveraging and amplifying heavy-tailed characteristics when beneficial. The concept of dynamically modulating the gradient distribution's tail heaviness based on an online estimate of the tail index is innovative and represents a paradigm shift in how heavy tails are viewed in optimization. The adaptive amplification exponent γ(α̂_t) that adjusts based on the estimated tail index is a novel mechanism not present in existing optimizers. The proposal also introduces a new online tail index estimator specifically designed for the training context. This novelty directly addresses the workshop's goal of repositioning theory around heavy-tailed behavior as an expected and potentially beneficial aspect of machine learning."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-founded and builds upon established theoretical concepts in heavy-tailed distributions and stochastic optimization. The mathematical formulation of the HTGA algorithm is rigorous, with clear definitions of the modulation function and adaptive amplification exponent. The online tail index estimation approach is based on established methods like the Hill estimator. However, there are some limitations to the theoretical soundness: (1) while the proposal acknowledges that a full convergence proof is complex, the preliminary theoretical analysis section could be more developed with clearer connections to existing convergence guarantees for heavy-tailed SGD, (2) the stability analysis of the proposed modulation function, especially when γ > 1, needs more rigorous treatment, and (3) the relationship between the tail index and generalization, while intuitively explained, lacks formal theoretical backing. The experimental design is comprehensive and well-structured, which partially compensates for these theoretical limitations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable scope. The implementation of HTGA can be integrated with standard deep learning frameworks, and the experimental design uses accessible datasets and models. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) the computational efficiency of the online tail index estimation during training could introduce significant overhead, especially for large models, (2) the hyperparameter space for HTGA is quite large (α_target, β, γ_max, γ_min, estimator parameters, τ_t strategy), which may require extensive tuning, (3) the stability of the algorithm when using amplification exponents γ > 1 could be problematic in practice and may require careful monitoring and safeguards, and (4) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address how to handle edge cases like very small gradient norms. Despite these challenges, the research is implementable with current technology and resources, though it may require more engineering effort than standard optimization methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important and timely topic in machine learning optimization. If successful, HTGA could represent a significant advancement in how we approach optimization in deep learning, shifting from merely controlling heavy tails to actively leveraging them for better generalization. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of repositioning heavy-tailed behavior as an expected and beneficial aspect of ML. The potential impact extends to both practical applications (improved generalization, especially in low-data regimes) and theoretical understanding (deeper insights into the relationship between optimization dynamics and generalization). The proposal could open a new line of research on distribution-aware optimization methods that go beyond first and second moments. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on standard benchmark tasks rather than demonstrating impact on cutting-edge applications or larger models where heavy-tailed behavior might be more pronounced and impactful."
