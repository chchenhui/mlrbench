        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses heavy-tailed distributions in machine learning optimization, specifically proposing to leverage them as a beneficial feature rather than a negative consequence - which is precisely the paradigm shift the workshop aims to promote. The proposal focuses on stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed noise (α-stable distributions), explores the relationship between heavy tails and generalization, and connects to dynamical systems through the fractional Fokker-Planck equations. These are all explicitly mentioned topics in the workshop description. The idea also addresses the 'edge of stability' concept implicitly through its mechanism of adapting the tail parameter based on local landscape properties."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (limitations of Gaussian noise in SGD), proposes a specific solution (α-stable noise with adaptive parameter), outlines the theoretical approach (fractional Fokker-Planck equations), and describes evaluation methods. The mathematical formulation is precise, using the stability parameter α∈(1,2] and explaining how it would be adapted. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific details of how the adaptation mechanism would work in practice (what exact metrics would determine α changes) and how the fractional Fokker-Planck equations would be solved or approximated. These details would likely be elaborated in a full paper."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows notable originality by proposing an adaptive heavy-tailed noise injection mechanism for SGD. While α-stable distributions and heavy-tailed noise have been studied in optimization before, the adaptive approach based on local geometry appears to be a fresh perspective. The theoretical framing using fractional Fokker-Planck equations to analyze escape times is also innovative. However, the core concept of using heavy-tailed noise in optimization is not entirely new, as prior work has explored Lévy flights and other heavy-tailed processes in optimization. The novelty lies primarily in the adaptive mechanism and theoretical analysis rather than in the fundamental concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Implementing α-stable noise generators is straightforward using established numerical methods. The adaptation mechanism would require estimating local curvature, which can be computationally expensive but approximable using techniques like Hessian-vector products or low-rank approximations. The theoretical analysis using fractional Fokker-Planck equations is mathematically complex but has precedent in the literature. The empirical evaluation on vision and language benchmarks is standard practice. The main implementation challenges would be in efficiently estimating the local geometry for adaptation and in tuning the hyperparameters of the adaptation mechanism, but these are surmountable with moderate effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea addresses an important issue in optimization for machine learning: how to escape sharp minima and find more generalizable solutions. If successful, this approach could lead to optimizers that consistently find better minima with improved generalization capabilities, which is a significant contribution to the field. The theoretical connection between heavy-tailed processes and generalization could advance our understanding of why certain optimization techniques work better than others. The impact extends beyond just a new optimizer variant - it contributes to the paradigm shift of viewing heavy tails as beneficial rather than problematic, directly addressing the workshop's goal. The significance is enhanced by the potential applicability to a wide range of models and tasks."
