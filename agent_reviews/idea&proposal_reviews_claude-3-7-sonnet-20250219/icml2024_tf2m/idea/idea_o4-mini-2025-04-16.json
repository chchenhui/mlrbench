        "justification": "The InfoPrune idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on theoretical foundations of foundation models, particularly under the 'Efficiency' theme. The proposal directly addresses model compression and pruning of foundation models, which is explicitly mentioned as an interested topic. The information-theoretic approach also connects well with the workshop's emphasis on using theoretical tools from information theory to understand and improve FMs. The idea offers theoretical guarantees for pruning, which matches the workshop's call for principled approaches to efficiency challenges in large models."

        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, proposed solution, and expected outcomes. The concept of using mutual information to quantify the importance of transformer submodules is precisely defined. The methodology involving alternating between MI estimation and structured pruning is well-explained. The evaluation metrics (50-70% parameter reduction with â‰¤1% performance drop) are specific and measurable. The only minor ambiguity is in the details of the variational MI estimator implementation, which would benefit from further elaboration, but this is acceptable for a research proposal of this length."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by applying information-theoretic principles to foundation model pruning. While pruning techniques exist for neural networks, the specific application of mutual information as a principled metric for transformer submodules represents a fresh approach. The theoretical upper bound on performance degradation is particularly innovative. However, the core concept builds upon existing work in both information theory and model compression rather than introducing an entirely new paradigm. The approach combines known techniques (mutual information estimation, structured pruning, fine-tuning) in a new way rather than developing fundamentally new methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing techniques and resources. Mutual information estimation techniques exist, as do methods for structured pruning and fine-tuning. The computational requirements, while substantial for foundation models, are within reach of academic or industry research labs. The main implementation challenges likely lie in accurately estimating mutual information in high-dimensional spaces and scaling the approach to very large models. The target of 50-70% parameter reduction with minimal performance drop is ambitious but not unrealistic given prior work in model compression. The alternating optimization approach is practical and has precedent in other domains."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in the deployment of foundation models: their massive computational and memory requirements. The significance is high because: 1) It offers a principled approach to a problem often solved with heuristics, 2) The theoretical guarantees could enable more predictable and reliable model compression, 3) A 50-70% reduction in parameters would substantially reduce deployment costs and energy consumption of FMs, and 4) The information-theoretic framework could provide insights into what information is most important in these models. The impact would extend beyond just efficiency to potentially improving our understanding of how foundation models process information."
