    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on efficiency techniques for long-context foundation models. The proposal builds upon the core idea of attention-guided dynamic KV cache compression as outlined in the research idea, implementing a system where compression strength is adaptively determined based on historical attention patterns. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with explicit references to FastKV [1], DynamicKV [2], and KV-Distill [3], and the proposal positions itself as addressing limitations in these approaches. The methodology directly addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly the balance between compression and performance, and adaptive compression strategies. The only minor inconsistency is that some referenced papers in the proposal (e.g., [4], [9]) are mentioned without fully elaborating on how they specifically inform the approach."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections for introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the three-stage methodology (Attention Score Tracking, Dynamic Compression Policy, Cache Update) is presented with precise mathematical formulations. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, and implementation details. The expected outcomes are concrete and measurable. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for reorganizing the cache to maintain spatial locality is mentioned but not detailed; (2) The compression-aware fine-tuning process could be more thoroughly explained; and (3) The relationship between the pruning and quantization approaches could be more explicitly defined - whether they are applied simultaneously or as alternatives."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing an attention-guided approach to dynamic KV cache compression. While existing methods like FastKV, DynamicKV, and KV-Distill already address KV cache compression, this proposal innovates by using historical attention patterns as the primary signal for determining compression strength. The decaying average of attention scores as a mechanism for tracking token importance is a fresh perspective. The combination of both pruning and variable-bit quantization in a unified framework is also innovative. However, the proposal shares some conceptual similarities with existing approaches - particularly DynamicKV's adaptive token retention and KV-Distill's learnable compression. The mathematical formulations for the compression policy, while well-defined, build upon established quantization and pruning techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The novelty lies more in the integration and application of these techniques rather than in developing entirely new compression methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-formulated mathematical expressions for attention score tracking and dynamic compression policies. The approach is grounded in established transformer architecture principles and builds logically on prior work in KV cache compression. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets (LongBench, PG19, GovReport) and baselines (FastKV, DynamicKV, KV-Distill). The evaluation metrics cover critical aspects: memory efficiency, performance, and latency. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the impact of key hyperparameters. The decay factor in the attention score tracking formula provides a theoretically sound way to balance recency and historical importance. However, there are some minor gaps: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential issues with attention score normalization across different layers and heads; (2) The theoretical justification for the specific quantization bit allocation formula could be stronger; and (3) The impact of compression on attention patterns in subsequent layers could be more thoroughly analyzed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach that can be implemented with existing transformer architectures and hardware. The three-stage methodology is clearly defined with concrete algorithms that can be integrated into the inference pipeline. The experimental setup using LLaMA-7B/13B and GPT-3 models on standard hardware (NVIDIA A100, Jetson AGX Orin) is realistic. The compression-aware fine-tuning on 10% of the dataset is a reasonable approach to adaptation. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) Tracking and updating attention scores for each token adds computational overhead during inference, which may partially offset the memory savings benefits; (2) The periodic reorganization of the cache for spatial locality could introduce latency spikes; (3) The implementation of variable-bit quantization for different tokens may require custom CUDA kernels for efficient execution; and (4) The proposal aims for 50-80% memory reduction while maintaining >90% performance, which is ambitious given that DynamicKV reportedly achieves 85% performance with 1.7% cache size. The compression-aware fine-tuning might require more data or iterations than estimated to achieve the stated goals."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying long-context foundation models: the prohibitive memory requirements of the KV cache during inference. Successfully implementing this approach would have substantial impact across multiple dimensions. Technically, it would advance our understanding of how attention patterns can guide efficient memory management in transformers. Practically, the 50-80% reduction in KV cache memory would enable deployment of LCFMs on resource-constrained devices, opening up applications in healthcare, robotics, and edge computing. The potential for real-time long-context reasoning on edge devices aligns with the growing need for AI systems that can process extensive contextual information without cloud connectivity. The environmental impact through reduced energy consumption is also significant. The proposal's significance is enhanced by the planned open-source implementation with APIs for integration into popular transformer libraries. However, the significance is somewhat tempered by the incremental nature of the advancement over existing methods like DynamicKV and KV-Distill, which already address similar challenges, albeit with different approaches."
