        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CoEval proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on developing standardized evaluation practices for generative AI's broader impacts, with particular emphasis on broadening participation beyond ML experts. The three-phase framework (Co-Design Workshops, Mixed-Methods Toolkit, Living Repository) perfectly operationalizes the participatory approach outlined in the research idea. The proposal explicitly builds upon the literature, citing all four papers from the review and integrating their key concepts: PARTICIP-AI's democratic surveying approach, Solaiman et al.'s categorization of social impacts, Chouldechova et al.'s measurement theory framework, and Parthasarathy et al.'s participatory governance model. The mathematical formulations for metrics like Consensus Score, Bias Amplification, and Societal Impact Index demonstrate how these theoretical frameworks are translated into practical evaluation tools."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and impact. The three-phase framework is logically presented with detailed explanations of each component. The mathematical formulations are precisely defined with appropriate notation and context. The pilot domains across text, vision, and audio modalities are clearly specified. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the Analytic Hierarchy Process and the final Societal Impact Index could be more explicitly connected, (2) the transition between qualitative stakeholder input and computational metrics could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'contrastive decoding') are mentioned without sufficient explanation for non-ML experts. Overall, the proposal maintains strong clarity throughout but has minor areas that could be refined for complete understanding by all potential stakeholders."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to generative AI evaluation. Its primary innovation lies in the systematic integration of participatory methods with rigorous measurement science, creating a comprehensive framework that bridges technical and social perspectives. The three-phase structure that combines co-design workshops, mixed-methods toolkit, and a living repository represents a fresh approach to standardizing evaluations. The mathematical formalization of stakeholder consensus (Consensus Score) and the Societal Impact Index are innovative contributions. However, many individual components draw heavily from existing approaches: card-sorting from Nielsen et al., Analytic Hierarchy Process from Saaty, and survey validation techniques from social sciences. While the proposal effectively synthesizes these elements into a cohesive framework, it represents an evolution of existing approaches rather than a revolutionary new paradigm. The novelty lies more in the integration and operationalization of these methods specifically for generative AI evaluation than in developing entirely new evaluation techniques."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. It effectively integrates established methods from both technical AI evaluation and social science research. The mathematical formulations for metrics like Consensus Score, Cronbach's Î± for survey validation, and Bias Amplification are technically sound and appropriate for their intended purposes. The three-phase approach is well-justified, with each component building logically on the previous one. The evaluation metrics for the framework itself (Stakeholder Engagement, Metric Validity, Scalability, Comparative Analysis) demonstrate careful consideration of how to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges in stakeholder recruitment and metric validation. However, there are some minor gaps: (1) the proposal could more thoroughly address potential conflicts between stakeholder perspectives and how to resolve them, (2) the statistical power calculations for sample sizes are not explicitly provided, and (3) more detail on the validation of computational metrics against human judgments would strengthen the methodological rigor. Overall, the proposal is well-founded with only minor areas for improvement."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with realistic implementation pathways. The three-phase framework breaks down the complex task of participatory evaluation into manageable components with clear workflows. The methodology leverages existing techniques (card-sorting, surveys, focus groups) that have proven effective in similar contexts. The proposal includes concrete plans for stakeholder recruitment through partnerships with civil society organizations and academic networks. The computational metrics are based on established techniques that can be implemented with current technology. However, several implementation challenges exist: (1) recruiting and maintaining engagement from diverse stakeholders (30-50 participants per domain) will require significant coordination and resources, (2) achieving consensus across stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests may be more difficult than anticipated, (3) the development of domain-specific evaluation tools across text, vision, and audio modalities simultaneously is ambitious, and (4) the timeline for iterative refinement through three cycles of feedback may be optimistic. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present moderate risks that would need careful management during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in AI governance and evaluation that has far-reaching implications. As generative AI systems rapidly proliferate across society, standardized frameworks for assessing their broader impacts are urgently needed. The CoEval framework has potential for significant impact in several ways: (1) it provides a practical solution to the problem of ad hoc, inconsistent evaluations highlighted in the task description, (2) it institutionalizes stakeholder participation, addressing power imbalances in AI development and evaluation, (3) it bridges technical and social perspectives on AI impacts, creating more comprehensive assessments, (4) it offers concrete tools and metrics that can be adopted by researchers, industry, and policymakers, and (5) it establishes a foundation for ongoing community governance of AI evaluation practices. The proposal directly responds to calls for more inclusive, rigorous, and standardized approaches to AI impact assessment from leading researchers in the field. If successfully implemented, CoEval could become a reference standard for generative AI evaluation, influencing how these technologies are developed, deployed, and regulated across domains."
