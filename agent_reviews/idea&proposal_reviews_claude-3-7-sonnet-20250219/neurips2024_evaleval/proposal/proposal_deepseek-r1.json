        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CoEval proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on standardizing evaluation practices for generative AI's societal impacts and broadening participation beyond ML experts. The three-phase framework (co-design workshops, mixed-methods toolkit, and living repository) perfectly matches the original idea. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including participatory approaches (from Particip-AI and Parthasarathy et al.), standardized evaluation protocols (from Solaiman et al.), and measurement validity (from Chouldechova et al.). The methodology specifically addresses all five challenges identified in the literature review."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections for introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-phase framework is logically presented with specific details for implementation. The mathematical formulations for bias amplification and criteria prioritization add technical rigor. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration - for example, the exact mechanisms for ensuring diverse stakeholder participation beyond recruitment strategies, and more details on how the living repository would be maintained and governed. The proposal uses appropriate technical language while remaining accessible to interdisciplinary audiences."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The CoEval framework offers notable originality in how it integrates participatory methods with evaluation science for generative AI assessment. While individual components like stakeholder workshops and computational metrics exist in prior work, the proposal's innovation lies in systematically combining these approaches into a cohesive, standardized framework spanning multiple generative AI domains. The multi-phase approach that bridges stakeholder co-design with technical metrics and policy templates is distinctive. However, some elements like card-sorting exercises and focus groups are established methodologies. The proposal builds upon rather than fundamentally reimagines existing evaluation approaches, which is appropriate but limits its groundbreaking nature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. It grounds its approach in evaluation science and participatory methods, with clear connections to the literature. The mathematical formulations for bias amplification and multi-criteria decision analysis are technically sound. The experimental validation plan includes appropriate control groups and metrics for assessing both process and outcomes. The three-phase methodology is logically structured with each component building on the previous one. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions inter-rater reliability targets (â‰¥80%), it could provide more detail on how validity will be established beyond stakeholder consensus. Overall, the technical approach is well-justified and methodologically robust."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a generally feasible implementation plan with clearly defined phases and concrete methodologies. The stakeholder recruitment, workshop facilitation, and toolkit development all use established methods that are practical to implement. The proposed sample sizes (15-20 participants per workshop) are reasonable for qualitative research. However, there are some feasibility challenges: (1) recruiting truly diverse stakeholders across all three domains may prove difficult, especially ensuring representation from marginalized communities; (2) achieving consensus among stakeholders with potentially competing interests could be challenging; and (3) the timeline for developing and validating tools across three domains (text, image, audio) simultaneously may be ambitious. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of these potential implementation challenges and mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CoEval framework addresses a critical gap in AI governance by standardizing societal impact assessments of generative AI. Its significance is substantial for several reasons: (1) it democratizes the evaluation process by including diverse stakeholders, particularly those from marginalized communities who are often excluded; (2) it advances measurement science for AI by grounding metrics in social theory and empirical validation; (3) it provides actionable tools for policymakers and industry to implement more responsible AI practices; and (4) it creates public infrastructure through its open-source toolkit and repository. The potential impact extends across research, industry, and policy domains, addressing a pressing need identified in the literature review. The proposal's emphasis on standardization and reproducibility further enhances its significance for the field."
