        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Co-Design Toolkit idea aligns excellently with the task's focus on evaluating broader impacts of generative AI. It directly addresses the workshop's key focus on broadening participation beyond AI experts by creating structured methods for diverse stakeholders to contribute to impact assessments. The proposal specifically targets the gap identified in the task description regarding standardized approaches to impact assessments. It also addresses multiple workshop topics including developing community-built evaluations, creating frameworks for documenting evaluation practices, and addressing barriers to broader adoption of social impact evaluation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The concept of a 'Co-Design Toolkit' is defined with specific components (impact scenario mapping, value elicitation, etc.) and concrete application contexts (educational chatbots, synthetic media tools). The implementation approach involving piloting with specific stakeholder groups is also clearly outlined. However, some minor ambiguities exist around the exact methodological details of how the toolkit would function in practice and how the qualitative data would be integrated into technical evaluations."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by addressing a significant gap in current AI evaluation practices. While participatory design and multi-stakeholder approaches exist in other domains, their structured application to generative AI impact assessment represents a fresh perspective. The toolkit's focus on making technical evaluations accessible to non-experts and creating standardized methods for incorporating diverse perspectives is innovative. However, the core methodological components (scenario mapping, value elicitation) build upon existing participatory design techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing methodologies from participatory design, HCI, and evaluation science. Creating structured tools for non-expert participation is achievable, and the plan to pilot with specific applications provides a practical implementation path. However, there are moderate challenges to consider: recruiting diverse stakeholders may be resource-intensive; balancing accessibility for non-experts with technical rigor could be difficult; and translating qualitative stakeholder input into actionable metrics for AI developers will require careful methodological development. The proposal would benefit from more details on how these challenges would be addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical gap in current AI development practices by creating pathways for diverse stakeholder input in impact assessment. If successful, it could significantly improve how generative AI systems are evaluated and designed, potentially preventing harmful impacts before deployment. The toolkit could become a standard resource for responsible AI development, influencing industry practices and policy frameworks. The significance is particularly high given the rapid deployment of generative AI systems and growing concerns about their societal impacts. The approach also has potential to democratize AI governance by empowering affected communities to shape evaluation criteria."
