    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The CoEval framework aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the need for standardized protocols for evaluating generative AI's societal impact, which is the central focus of the workshop. The proposal emphasizes broadening participation beyond AI experts to include diverse stakeholders, which perfectly matches the workshop's 'Key Focus: Breadth of Participation.' CoEval's three-phase approach (co-design workshops, mixed-methods toolkit, and living repository) addresses all five topics mentioned in the task description, particularly the creation of frameworks for documenting and standardizing evaluation practices and developing community-built evaluations. The only minor limitation is that while policy recommendations are mentioned, the proposal could elaborate more on specific investment directions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The CoEval framework is presented with strong clarity, outlining a structured three-phase approach with clear objectives and methodologies. The motivation is well-articulated, identifying specific gaps in current evaluation practices. Each phase of the framework is concisely described with concrete components (workshops, toolkit elements, repository features). The implementation plan includes piloting across three domains and iterative refinement. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific metrics that will be used in the toolkit, how the co-design workshops will ensure truly diverse participation, and more details on how the living repository will be maintained and governed. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "CoEval offers notable innovation in its approach to generative AI evaluation. Its primary novelty lies in the participatory, multi-stakeholder methodology that systematically incorporates diverse perspectives into evaluation design—moving beyond the typical expert-centric approaches. The three-phase framework that combines co-design workshops with mixed-methods toolkits and a living repository represents a fresh integration of existing concepts. While participatory methods and evaluation frameworks exist in other domains, applying them specifically to generative AI evaluation in this structured manner is relatively novel. However, many of the individual components (surveys, focus groups, computational metrics) are established methods being adapted rather than fundamentally new approaches, which limits the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The CoEval framework presents a largely feasible approach with realistic implementation pathways. The three-phase structure provides a clear roadmap, and the proposal wisely plans to pilot across three domains and refine through iteration. The mixed-methods toolkit leverages established research methods, and the living repository concept uses existing open-source infrastructure models. However, several implementation challenges exist: coordinating diverse stakeholders for meaningful co-design workshops requires significant facilitation expertise and resources; developing metrics that satisfy both technical rigor and accessibility to non-experts is challenging; and maintaining a living repository requires long-term commitment and governance structures. The proposal acknowledges the need for iteration but could benefit from more specific details on resource requirements and potential obstacles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "CoEval addresses a critical gap in the AI field—the lack of standardized, inclusive protocols for evaluating generative AI's societal impact. Its significance stems from its potential to democratize the evaluation process, ensuring that impacts on marginalized communities and diverse stakeholders are systematically considered rather than overlooked. By creating open-source tools and repositories, it could significantly improve transparency and reproducibility in AI evaluation. The framework could influence policy development and industry practices by providing evidence-based, community-endorsed standards. Its impact extends beyond academic contexts to practical implementation across various domains. While highly significant, it stops short of the highest score because its ultimate impact depends on adoption by major AI developers and policymakers, which is not guaranteed despite the framework's merits."
