        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The ParticipatoryAI framework aligns exceptionally well with the task's focus on evaluating broader impacts of generative AI systems. It directly addresses the workshop's key focus on broadening participation by creating structured mechanisms for multistakeholder engagement, particularly emphasizing marginalized voices. The proposal tackles all major topics outlined in the task: sharing methodologies (through open-source tools), developing future directions (via the hybrid framework), addressing barriers to adoption (through scalability features), developing policy recommendations (explicitly mentioned as an outcome), and creating standardized evaluation frameworks (core to the proposal). The only minor gap is that while the proposal mentions 'rigorous technical validation,' it could more explicitly address how it would integrate with existing technical evaluation metrics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a structured framework with well-defined components and objectives. The four main components (aggregating perspectives, leveraging NLP/causal modeling, improving scalability, and generating recommendations) provide a clear architecture for the system. The expected outcomes are also explicitly stated. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further elaboration - particularly how the NLP and causal modeling would specifically work to transform qualitative inputs into standardized 'impact profiles,' and how the system would quantitatively 'prioritize marginalized voices' while balancing with technical performance metrics. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "ParticipatoryAI presents a highly innovative approach to AI impact assessment by combining several novel elements: (1) the structured integration of non-technical stakeholders into technical evaluation processes, (2) the use of federated learning to balance privacy with collaborative assessment, (3) the explicit focus on marginalized voices in a quantifiable framework, and (4) the creation of standardized 'impact profiles' that bridge qualitative and quantitative evaluation. While participatory design and multistakeholder governance exist in other domains, applying these concepts systematically to generative AI evaluation with computational support represents a fresh approach. The score is not higher only because some individual components (like using NLP for qualitative analysis or federated learning for privacy) are established techniques being applied to a new domain rather than fundamentally new methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal faces moderate feasibility challenges. On the positive side, many technical components (surveys, NLP analysis, federated learning) have established implementations. However, several significant challenges exist: (1) Recruiting diverse stakeholders at scale, particularly from marginalized communities, requires substantial resources and coordination; (2) Developing reliable causal models that accurately capture complex societal impacts is technically challenging; (3) Creating interpretable models that can quantify tradeoffs between technical performance and societal harm involves difficult value judgments; (4) Ensuring that stakeholder inputs are translated into actionable technical modifications requires bridging significant knowledge gaps. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively represent considerable implementation hurdles that would require significant interdisciplinary collaboration and methodological innovation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is exceptionally high given the rapid deployment of generative AI systems across society with limited systematic evaluation of their broader impacts. The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI governance: the lack of structured mechanisms to incorporate diverse stakeholder perspectives into technical evaluation processes. By creating standardized methods for participatory assessment, the framework could fundamentally reshape how AI systems are evaluated before and during deployment. The potential impacts include: more equitable AI systems, increased trust in AI governance, prevention of harmful deployments, and creation of accountability mechanisms that center affected communities. The approach could become a foundation for global AI governance frameworks, addressing an urgent need identified by policymakers worldwide."
