    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Data' topic of model behavior attribution. It directly tackles the problem of data contamination from synthetic sources and proposes methods to detect and understand how this contamination affects model behavior. The idea explicitly addresses data attribution, data leakage/contamination, and feedback loops mentioned in the task description. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't address the other topics like mechanistic interpretability or algorithmic choices, but it thoroughly covers its chosen focus area."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The concept of developing fingerprinting techniques for synthetic data and systematically studying contamination effects is presented concisely. The specific techniques (perplexity distributions, token frequency anomalies, stylistic markers) provide concrete details about the approach. However, some minor ambiguities remain about the exact methodology for quantifying causal effects and how the framework would be implemented in practice, which prevents it from receiving the highest score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by focusing on lightweight, scalable techniques for synthetic data detection rather than computationally intensive approaches. The systematic study of contamination effects at different levels is a fresh perspective. However, fingerprinting techniques for synthetic text detection have been explored before, and the idea builds upon existing concepts in data attribution and contamination analysis. While it offers a valuable new combination of approaches and scale considerations, it's not fundamentally revolutionizing the field but rather advancing it in important ways."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Creating fingerprints based on statistical artifacts is practical and implementable. The controlled injection of synthetic data into clean datasets is a sound experimental approach. The necessary tools and models for this research already exist. The main challenge would be scaling to truly massive pre-training corpora, which might require significant computational resources, but the proposal specifically addresses scalability concerns by focusing on lightweight techniques. The methodological approach is well-grounded in established practices."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical and growing problem in AI development. As synthetic data increasingly contaminates the web, understanding and mitigating the effects of these feedback loops is essential for the sustainable development of future AI systems. The potential impact is substantial, as the findings could directly inform data curation strategies for major language models and help prevent model collapse. The work could establish important baselines and methodologies for the field moving forward. The significance is heightened by the timeliness of the issue, as synthetic content proliferation accelerates."
