        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Data attribution and selection' topic. It directly tackles the challenge of attributing model outputs back to training examples, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The proposed Coreset Influence Graph method aims to efficiently identify influential training examples that drive specific model behaviors, which is central to the workshop's focus on model behavior attribution. The idea also touches on detecting data contamination and guiding dataset curation, which are additional topics mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure that outlines the motivation, approach, and expected outcomes. The hierarchical process is explained step-by-step: clustering examples into coresets, using approximate influence functions, computing low-rank Hessian inverses, aggregating gradient-Hessian interactions, and drilling down on high-impact clusters. The technical terminology is precise and appropriate for the domain. However, some minor ambiguities exist around the exact clustering methodology for creating coresets and the specific criteria for determining 'high-impact' clusters, which prevents it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining several existing techniques (influence functions, coresets, hierarchical clustering, and randomized sketching) in a novel way to address the scalability challenges of data attribution. The hierarchical approach to influence computation is particularly innovative, as it strategically focuses computational resources on the most impactful data points. While influence functions themselves are not new, the two-stage hierarchical approach and the application to extremely large datasets represent a fresh perspective. However, it builds upon existing influence function literature rather than introducing a fundamentally new attribution paradigm, which limits its novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing techniques and computational resources. The proposal wisely addresses the computational challenges of influence functions by using approximation techniques like randomized sketching and hierarchical filtering. The approach is grounded in established mathematical frameworks (gradient computations, Hessian approximations) and builds on existing work in influence functions. However, there are implementation challenges that could arise when scaling to truly massive datasets with billions of examples, particularly in the initial clustering phase and the computation of even approximate Hessians for very large models. The effectiveness of the coreset approximation would need empirical validation to ensure it doesn't miss important influences."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in modern machine learning: understanding how specific training examples influence model behavior at scale. As models and datasets grow larger, this capability becomes increasingly important for diagnosing biases, detecting contamination, and improving dataset quality. The potential applications outlined (detecting mislabeled data, targeted data pruning/augmentation, and dataset auditing) would have substantial practical impact for ML practitioners. The significance is particularly high given the current trend toward ever-larger models and datasets where traditional influence methods become computationally intractable. This work could enable transparency and accountability in large-scale ML systems that are currently opaque."
