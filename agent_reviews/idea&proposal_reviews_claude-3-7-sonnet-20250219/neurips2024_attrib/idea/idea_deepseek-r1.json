        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, particularly addressing the 'Data attribution and selection' topic under the 'Data' category. The proposal directly tackles the question of how to efficiently attribute model outputs back to specific training examples, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The meta-learning approach to create influence proxies is relevant to understanding how training data affects model behavior. However, it doesn't address some other aspects of the task such as data leakage/contamination monitoring or the broader topics related to trained models and learning algorithms, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear problem statement (computational inefficiency of current influence methods), a proposed solution (meta-learning framework for a proxy model), and expected outcomes. The technical approach involving gradient dynamics and validation performance is outlined, though some details remain ambiguous. For instance, the exact methodology for how the proxy model will be trained on the subset of precomputed influences, what specific embeddings will be used as inputs, and how the generalization to the full dataset will be validated could be more precisely defined. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a higher clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining meta-learning with influence estimation to create a scalable proxy. While influence functions and data attribution methods exist, the approach of training a dedicated proxy model to predict influence scores without exhaustive recomputation appears to be a fresh perspective. The integration of gradient dynamics with meta-learning for this specific purpose is innovative. However, the concept builds upon existing influence estimation methods rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, and meta-learning for efficiency gains has been applied in other contexts, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is somewhat feasible but faces implementation challenges. Training an accurate influence proxy requires that the proxy can generalize from a subset where influence is precomputed to the entire dataset, which may be difficult if influence patterns are complex or dataset-specific. The computational resources needed to precompute influence on even a subset of data for large models could still be substantial. Additionally, validating that the proxy's predictions match true influence would require extensive testing. While the core concept is implementable with current technology, these challenges suggest moderate feasibility rather than high feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea addresses an important problem in the field of interpretable machine learning and data attribution. If successful, it would enable practitioners to efficiently identify influential training examples in large-scale models, which has significant implications for dataset curation, bias mitigation, and model debugging. The potential to reduce computational costs of influence estimation by orders of magnitude would make these techniques accessible to a broader range of researchers and applications. The impact extends to critical areas like identifying harmful examples in LLM training data, which aligns with current concerns in responsible AI development. However, it's focused on a specific technical challenge rather than revolutionizing the entire field of model behavior attribution."
