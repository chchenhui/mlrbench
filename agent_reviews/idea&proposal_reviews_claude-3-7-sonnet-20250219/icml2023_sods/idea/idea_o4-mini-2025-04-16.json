    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, addressing the challenge of discrete sampling and optimization in black-box settings. It directly tackles the limitations mentioned in the task regarding black-box objectives and problems with long-range, high-order correlations. The proposed GNN surrogate-driven GFlowNet approach falls within the 'other effective proposal strategies' category mentioned in the task, and extends GFlowNets (which are explicitly mentioned in the task) to work better with black-box objectives. The idea connects to applications like language modeling and protein engineering as highlighted in the task scope. However, it doesn't explicitly address some aspects mentioned in the task such as embedding into continuous space or gradient-based MCMC algorithms, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure explaining the motivation, approach, and potential applications. The core mechanism of coupling a GNN surrogate with a GFlowNet sampler is explained, along with how they interact through an iterative process. However, some technical details remain ambiguous. For instance, the exact active learning strategy for selecting high-uncertainty regions, the specific importance-weighting scheme for corrections, and the precise mechanism for recalibrating GFlowNet rewards could be more thoroughly defined. The proposal would benefit from more concrete explanations of these components to eliminate potential ambiguities in implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by combining GNN surrogates with GFlowNets in an iterative framework specifically designed for black-box discrete sampling. While both GNNs and GFlowNets exist separately, their integration with active learning and importance-weighted corrections for black-box optimization appears to be a fresh approach. The iterative surrogate refinement coupled with flow-based sampling represents an innovative solution to the query efficiency problem in black-box settings. However, surrogate-based optimization and active learning are established techniques in other domains, so the novelty lies more in the specific combination and application to discrete sampling rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach appears largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Both GNNs and GFlowNets are established techniques with available implementations. The iterative framework described is conceptually implementable, requiring standard components like surrogate modeling, active learning, and importance sampling. However, there are notable challenges: training effective GNN surrogates for complex discrete spaces may require careful architecture design; balancing exploration and exploitation in the active learning component could be tricky; and ensuring the surrogate's bias doesn't mislead the GFlowNet might require sophisticated calibration techniques. Additionally, the computational overhead of training both a GNN and a GFlowNet simultaneously could be substantial, especially for high-dimensional discrete spaces."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in machine learning and optimization: efficient sampling and optimization over black-box discrete objectives. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of discrete optimization in language modeling, protein engineering, and combinatorial design - all areas of substantial current interest. If successful, this approach could dramatically reduce the number of expensive function evaluations needed in these domains, potentially enabling applications that are currently computationally prohibitive. The ability to handle long-range, high-order correlations in discrete spaces would represent a meaningful advance over current methods. The impact could extend across multiple fields where black-box discrete optimization is a bottleneck, making this a highly significant research direction."
