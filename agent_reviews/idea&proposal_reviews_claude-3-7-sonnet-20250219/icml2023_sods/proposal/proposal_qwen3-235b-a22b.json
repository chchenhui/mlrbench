    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenges of discrete space sampling/optimization with black-box objectives and high-order correlations mentioned in the task description. The proposed GNS-GFN framework implements the exact approach outlined in the research idea, combining a GNN surrogate with GFlowNets and incorporating active learning and reward calibration. The proposal also acknowledges and builds upon the literature review, particularly addressing the identified challenges of surrogate accuracy, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and handling high-order correlations. The methodology is comprehensive and includes all components mentioned in the research idea with detailed mathematical formulations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The framework overview provides a logical flow of the methodology, with each component explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The objectives, methods, and expected outcomes are well-defined. The inclusion of a framework diagram (though only referenced as a placeholder) helps visualize the approach. The experimental design section outlines specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, making the validation strategy transparent. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the GNN surrogate's pseudo-gradients into the GFlowNet training could be more explicitly defined, and (2) some technical details about the active learning strategy's implementation could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing techniques in a novel way. The integration of GNN surrogates with GFlowNets specifically for black-box discrete sampling is innovative and addresses a gap in current methods. The active learning component for surrogate refinement and the reward calibration mechanism to correct surrogate bias are thoughtful additions that distinguish this approach from standard GFlowNets or surrogate-based methods. However, each individual component (GNNs, GFlowNets, active learning, surrogate modeling) is well-established in the literature. The novelty lies primarily in their integration and application to black-box discrete sampling problems rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal builds incrementally on existing GFlowNet literature cited in the review rather than presenting a revolutionary approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the GNN surrogate, GFlowNet sampler, active learning strategy, and reward calibration are well-defined and theoretically sound. The flow matching condition and trajectory balance objective for GFlowNets are correctly presented. The surrogate training objective and reward calibration approach are well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that will effectively validate the method's performance. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and addresses them through specific components (e.g., reward calibration to mitigate surrogate bias). However, there are some minor gaps: (1) the theoretical convergence properties of the combined framework could be more thoroughly analyzed, and (2) the exact uncertainty quantification method for the GNN surrogate is somewhat underspecified, with multiple options mentioned but not fully developed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. All components (GNNs, GFlowNets, active learning) have established implementations that can be adapted for this framework. The experimental design includes both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, providing a practical validation pathway. The implementation details specify concrete architectural choices and hyperparameters. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) training GFlowNets is known to be unstable, and the addition of a surrogate model may introduce further training complexities; (2) the computational cost of training both a GNN surrogate and a GFlowNet model could be substantial for large-scale problems like protein design; (3) the active learning component requires careful implementation to avoid introducing biases in the surrogate training. These challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, but they do represent non-trivial engineering and research hurdles that will require careful attention."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem with significant potential impact. Efficient black-box discrete sampling and optimization has wide-ranging applications in protein engineering, language modeling, and combinatorial optimization, as correctly identified in the proposal. The expected outcomes include substantial reductions in function evaluations (5-10Ã— vs. baselines) and improved modeling of long-range dependencies, which would represent meaningful advances in the field. The broader implications for resource-constrained domains like biotechnology and materials science are well-articulated and realistic. The work bridges discrete optimization with geometric deep learning, potentially opening new research directions. While the impact may not be transformative to the entire field of machine learning, it could significantly advance specific application domains where discrete optimization is a bottleneck, particularly in scientific discovery applications where function evaluations are expensive."
