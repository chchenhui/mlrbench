    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenges of discrete space sampling/optimization with black-box objectives and high-order correlations mentioned in the task description. The methodology implements the exact approach outlined in the research idea, combining GNN surrogates with GFlowNets in an iterative framework. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by extending GFlowNets to handle black-box objectives more efficiently. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes various GFlowNet applications, the proposal could have more explicitly positioned itself relative to specific papers mentioned in the review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations and pseudocode. The three-phase framework (surrogate training, GFlowNet sampling, and active learning) is logically presented with clear connections between components. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for graph representation of text sequences could be more detailed, (2) the reward recalibration process could be explained more thoroughly regarding how often it occurs, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., flow matching condition) are used without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with GFlowNets."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining GNN surrogates with GFlowNets in a novel way to address black-box discrete optimization. The integration of active learning with uncertainty quantification for surrogate refinement and the reward recalibration mechanism are innovative contributions. However, the core components (GNNs, GFlowNets, surrogate models, active learning) are all established techniques, and the novelty lies primarily in their specific combination and application to black-box discrete sampling. The approach builds incrementally on existing GFlowNet literature rather than proposing a fundamentally new paradigm. Similar surrogate-based approaches have been explored in other optimization contexts, though perhaps not with this specific combination of techniques for discrete spaces."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound with well-justified methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for the GNN surrogate, GFlowNet training, uncertainty quantification, and reward recalibration are correct and appropriate. The three-phase framework is logically coherent, and the pseudocode provides a clear implementation path. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. The proposal demonstrates awareness of potential issues (like surrogate bias) and includes mechanisms to address them (reward recalibration). The only minor concerns are: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address how the GNN will handle very large discrete spaces where most configurations remain unexplored, (2) there's limited discussion of convergence guarantees or theoretical properties of the combined approach, and (3) the uncertainty quantification via MC dropout is a heuristic approach that may not capture all forms of uncertainty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined implementation steps. All components (GNNs, GFlowNets, active learning) have existing implementations that can be adapted. The experimental domains (protein design, TSP, language models) are appropriate and accessible. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) training both a GNN surrogate and a GFlowNet requires significant computational resources, especially for large-scale problems, (2) the iterative nature of the framework may lead to long training times, (3) the proposal doesn't fully address how to efficiently represent and process very large discrete spaces, and (4) the effectiveness of the approach depends heavily on the quality of the initial seed dataset, which might be difficult to obtain for some domains. These challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, but they do present significant hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem with wide-ranging applications. Efficient black-box discrete optimization has significant implications for protein design, language model fine-tuning, and combinatorial optimization problems. The potential 50-70% reduction in function evaluations claimed in the expected outcomes would represent a substantial improvement in domains where evaluations are expensive. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications in drug discovery, AI alignment, and compiler optimization. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's focus on democratizing access to these tools through open-sourcing. The only limitation to the significance is that the approach may not generalize equally well across all discrete optimization problems, particularly those with extremely large or complex search spaces, and the actual impact depends on achieving the ambitious performance improvements mentioned in the expected outcomes."

It is well-aligned with the task description, clearly articulated, technically sound, and has significant potential impact. While not revolutionary in its individual components, the integration of GNN surrogates with GFlowNets for black-box discrete optimization represents a valuable contribution that could advance the field substantially if the claimed performance improvements are achieved.",
