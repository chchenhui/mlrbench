    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing several key topics explicitly mentioned in the workshop call. It directly tackles 'adversarial threats on LMMs', 'cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs', and 'defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs' - all of which are primary focus areas for the AdvML-Frontiers'24 workshop. The proposal's emphasis on cross-modal defenses specifically targets the intersection between AdvML and LMMs, which is the central theme of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some secondary topics like ethical implications or privacy concerns, though these are implicitly connected to the research."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. It clearly articulates the motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-part methodology (cross-modal adversarial training, multimodal defense mechanisms, and evaluation metrics) provides a concrete framework for understanding the research approach. The proposal is well-articulated with minimal ambiguity about what will be done. However, some specific details could be further elaborated - for instance, the exact nature of the 'cross-modal watermarking' and 'cross-modal noise injection' techniques could be more precisely defined, and the evaluation metrics could be more specifically described rather than just mentioned as a category."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea demonstrates good novelty by focusing on cross-modal defenses for LMMs, which represents a relatively unexplored area in adversarial machine learning. While adversarial training and defense mechanisms are established concepts in the field, their application specifically to cross-modal vulnerabilities in LMMs represents a fresh perspective. The proposal combines existing concepts (adversarial training, watermarking, noise injection) in new ways to address emerging challenges in multimodal systems. However, the individual techniques mentioned (adversarial training, watermarking, noise injection) are extensions of existing approaches rather than fundamentally new methods, which somewhat limits the novelty score. The research would benefit from more explicitly identifying what specific innovations it brings beyond applying known techniques to a new domain."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methodologies. The proposed approaches build upon established techniques in adversarial machine learning, extending them to multimodal contexts. The three-part methodology provides a clear roadmap for implementation. Adversarial training frameworks exist and can be adapted for cross-modal scenarios, and techniques like watermarking and noise injection are implementable with current tools. The evaluation component is also practical, as metrics for robustness can be developed by extending existing evaluation frameworks. The main challenges would likely be in the computational resources required for adversarial training of large multimodal models and in developing truly effective cross-modal defenses that don't significantly degrade model performance, but these challenges appear surmountable with current technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is substantial, addressing a critical vulnerability in increasingly deployed LMM systems. As multimodal AI systems become more prevalent in real-world applications, their security against adversarial attacks becomes paramount. The research directly addresses this pressing need by developing defenses against cross-modal vulnerabilities. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in securing AI systems used in critical domains. The work could establish new standards for robust multimodal systems and influence how future LMMs are designed and deployed. Additionally, the research contributes to the broader field of adversarial machine learning by exploring the unique challenges posed by multimodality, potentially opening new research directions at this intersection."
