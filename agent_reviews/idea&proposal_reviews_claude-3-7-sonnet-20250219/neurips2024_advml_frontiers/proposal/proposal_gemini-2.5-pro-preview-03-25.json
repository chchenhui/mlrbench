        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the AdvML-Frontiers workshop's focus on 'Adversarial threats on LMMs,' 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs,' and 'Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs.' The proposed Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization (CMAI) framework faithfully implements the three-pronged approach outlined in the research idea: (1) Cross-Modal Consistency Verification (CMCV), (2) Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training (MBAT), and (3) Adaptive Robustness Mechanism (ARM). The proposal also effectively incorporates insights from the literature review, citing and building upon relevant works like ProEAT [1], universal adversarial attacks [2], CrossFire [3], and other cross-modal vulnerability studies [4, 5, 9]. The methodology addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly cross-modal vulnerabilities, efficient adversarial training, maintaining performance on benign inputs, and adaptive defense mechanisms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the context, problem statement, and significance of the research. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of each component of the CMAI framework, including mathematical formulations for the CMCV module, MBAT process, and ARM mechanism. The experimental design is comprehensive, outlining baseline models, attack scenarios, evaluation protocols, and metrics. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly delineated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the CMCV score and the ARM thresholds could be more explicitly defined, (2) The exact implementation details of how ARM would modify model parameters during inference could be more specific, and (3) Some of the placeholder references [5-10] make it slightly difficult to fully assess the literature integration, though this is a minor issue given the comprehensive treatment of the actual cited works [1-4]."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in its approach to cross-modal adversarial defense. The CMAI framework introduces several innovative elements: (1) The integration of cross-modal consistency verification with adversarial training specifically targeting inter-modal relationships, (2) The formulation of a loss function that explicitly balances task performance and cross-modal consistency during adversarial training, and (3) The adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts defense levels based on detected inconsistencies. While individual components like adversarial training and consistency verification have been explored in prior work (e.g., [1, 6, 8]), their combination and specific application to cross-modal vulnerabilities represents a fresh perspective. However, the proposal shares some conceptual similarities with works mentioned in the literature review, particularly [6] on cross-modal consistency training and [7] on adaptive defense mechanisms, which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature. The mathematical formulation of MBAT, while solid, builds upon established adversarial training techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new optimization approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the CMAI components are well-defined and theoretically grounded. The CMCV module's similarity metrics and contrastive learning approach are based on established principles in representation learning. The MBAT formulation extends PGD-based adversarial training with a well-justified objective function that balances task performance and cross-modal consistency. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines, diverse attack scenarios (existing, adaptive, and transfer attacks), and rigorous evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contribution of each component. The proposal also acknowledges potential computational challenges and provides strategies to address them. One minor limitation is that while the ARM component is conceptually sound, its specific implementation details during inference could be more rigorously defined with clearer decision boundaries and adaptation mechanisms. Additionally, while the proposal mentions potential trade-offs between robustness and clean accuracy, a more detailed theoretical analysis of these trade-offs would strengthen the soundness further."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation paths. The use of standard, publicly available datasets (VQAv2, MS COCO, NLVR2, Flickr30k) eliminates the need for new data collection. The experimental design leverages existing LMM architectures as base models, making implementation more practical. The CMAI components (CMCV, MBAT, ARM) are described with sufficient detail to be implementable, with clear mathematical formulations and training procedures. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The computational resources required for adversarial training on large multimodal models could be substantial, especially when generating perturbations that maximize both task loss and cross-modal inconsistency, (2) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address the potential computational overhead of the ARM component during inference, which could impact real-time applications, (3) The adaptive white-box attacks designed to specifically target CMAI may require significant engineering effort to implement effectively. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent practical hurdles that would need to be carefully managed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical vulnerability in LMMs that has significant implications for their safe deployment in high-stakes applications. Cross-modal adversarial attacks represent a serious threat to multimodal systems used in autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, content moderation, and other safety-critical domains. The CMAI framework offers a comprehensive defense strategy that could substantially improve the robustness and trustworthiness of these systems. The scientific contributions are valuable, establishing cross-modal consistency verification and enforcement as a potentially powerful principle for building robust multimodal AI. The practical impact is also substantial, as the framework is designed to be integrated with existing LMM architectures with minimal modifications, providing an accessible defense strategy for real-world deployment. The proposal also aligns well with ethical AI principles by addressing security and safety vulnerabilities in powerful multimodal models. While the significance is high, it falls short of the highest score because the proposal focuses primarily on defensive techniques rather than fundamentally transforming our understanding of cross-modal vulnerabilities or establishing entirely new paradigms for robust multimodal learning."
