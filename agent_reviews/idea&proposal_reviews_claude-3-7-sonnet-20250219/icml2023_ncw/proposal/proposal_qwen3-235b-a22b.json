    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on neural compression, information theory, and theoretical understanding of compression without quantization. The FlowCodec framework precisely implements the continuous-flow neural compression with information-bottleneck guarantees outlined in the idea, replacing discrete quantization with normalizing flows. The proposal thoroughly incorporates relevant literature, citing and building upon works mentioned in the review such as OT-Flow, entropy-informed flows, and IB-INNs. The mathematical formulations are consistent with information-theoretic principles emphasized in both the task description and literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical concepts are explained thoroughly with appropriate mathematical notation and formulations. The algorithm design section provides detailed equations for the encoder, prior distribution, and optimization objectives. The experimental design is well-specified with clear metrics and baselines. However, there are a few areas where additional clarity would be beneficial, such as more explicit connections between the theoretical bounds and practical implementation, and more detailed explanation of how the continuous latent space is practically encoded into bits without quantization."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "FlowCodec presents a novel approach to neural compression by eliminating discrete quantization entirely and replacing it with continuous normalizing flows. This represents a significant departure from conventional neural compression techniques. The integration of information bottleneck principles with flow-based models for compression is innovative, as most existing approaches rely on discrete latent spaces. The proposal extends beyond existing work by providing a fully differentiable framework with theoretical guarantees, enabling joint source-channel coding through flow composition. While it builds upon existing concepts like normalizing flows and information bottleneck, the specific combination and application to compression without quantization represents a fresh perspective in the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations, with well-formulated mathematical expressions for the encoder, prior distribution, and optimization objectives. The information-theoretic analysis linking the Lagrangian multiplier to rate-distortion bounds is particularly sound. However, there are some potential concerns about the practical implementation of continuous latent spaces for compression. While the proposal mentions simulating practical encoding by binning z into intervals, it's not entirely clear how this avoids the fundamental challenges of quantization. Additionally, while the theoretical framework is well-developed, some claims about performance improvements over existing methods would benefit from more rigorous justification or preliminary results."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a reasonable implementation strategy and work plan, with clear steps for model development, training, and evaluation. The use of established frameworks like PyTorch and existing flow architectures increases feasibility. The 14-week timeline is ambitious but potentially achievable for a proof-of-concept implementation. However, there are some practical challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) Training deep normalizing flows is known to be computationally intensive and sometimes unstable; (2) The absence of quantization raises questions about how actual bit-rate estimation will be performed in practice; (3) The evaluation on multiple modalities (images, video, audio) within the timeframe may be overly ambitious. These challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, but they do present significant hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "FlowCodec addresses a fundamental limitation in neural compression—the non-differentiability introduced by quantization—which has implications for both theoretical analysis and practical performance. If successful, this approach could bridge the gap between information theory and deep learning for compression, providing a framework with stronger theoretical guarantees while maintaining competitive empirical performance. The potential applications in low-latency compression for edge AI systems and real-time video encoding are particularly significant. The extension to joint source-channel coding also opens new avenues for robust compression in noisy environments. The work could influence future research directions in neural compression by demonstrating the viability of continuous latent representations and providing a more principled approach to rate-distortion optimization."
