    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop theme of applying moral philosophy and psychology to AI practices, specifically focusing on developmental moral psychology as suggested in the research idea. The proposal incorporates the staged approach (pre-conventional, conventional, post-conventional) outlined in the idea and builds a comprehensive framework around it. It also effectively integrates the literature review, citing relevant works like Oliveira et al. (2023) on cultural values, Endo (2025) on experiential learning, Ganguli et al. (2023) on moral self-correction, and Tennant et al. (2023) on hybrid approaches. The proposal addresses key workshop topics including alternatives to RLHF, incorporating developmental psychology into AI, and concerns about monolithic value alignment. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions cultural variability as a key challenge, the proposal acknowledges but does not fully address this aspect in its initial implementation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The Developmental Scaffolding framework is explained in detail with specific stages clearly defined. The training curricula for each stage are well-described with appropriate data sources and learning signals. The experimental design, including baseline models and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly outlined. Mathematical formulations for loss functions are correctly presented. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact transition criteria between stages could be more precisely defined, (2) some technical details about how the model would recognize which stage of reasoning to apply in a given situation are somewhat underspecified, and (3) the proposal occasionally uses technical terminology that might benefit from brief explanations for interdisciplinary audiences (e.g., PEFT, LoRA). Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible with only minor areas needing additional clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to AI value alignment by systematically applying developmental moral psychology theories to create a staged training curriculum. While individual elements (curriculum learning, moral development theories in AI) have been explored as noted in the literature review, the comprehensive integration of these concepts into a formal 'Developmental Scaffolding' framework with stage-specific training objectives and evaluation metrics represents a fresh contribution. The proposal innovatively adapts Kohlberg's stages into computational training regimes with appropriate data and reinforcement signals. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that the core psychological theories being applied are well-established, and some papers in the literature review (though some appear to be fictional) have already begun exploring similar developmental approaches. The technical implementation, while well-designed, primarily uses existing methods (SFT, RLHF, DPO) rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal's originality lies more in its systematic integration and application of these elements rather than in creating entirely new concepts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations, drawing appropriately from established psychological theories (Kohlberg's stages) and machine learning techniques. The methodology is rigorous and well-justified, with clear connections between the psychological theory and the proposed computational implementation. The training approach using sequential fine-tuning is technically sound, and the evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including both quantitative metrics and qualitative human evaluations. The mathematical formulations for loss functions are correctly presented. The proposal also thoughtfully addresses potential challenges and limitations, showing awareness of issues like cultural variability and evaluation difficulties. The experimental design with appropriate baselines and controls strengthens the scientific rigor. One minor weakness is that some of the cited literature appears to be fictional or from future dates, which slightly undermines the empirical grounding. Additionally, while the proposal acknowledges the Western-centric nature of Kohlberg's theory, it could more thoroughly address how this might impact the generalizability of the results. Overall, the proposal presents a well-founded and rigorous research plan with only minor theoretical gaps."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that utilizes existing technologies and methodologies. The use of pre-trained open-source LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral) as foundation models is practical, and the sequential fine-tuning approach with parameter-efficient techniques (PEFT, LoRA) addresses computational resource constraints. The data requirements seem manageable, with the proposal identifying specific existing datasets (ETHICS, Moral Stories) and suggesting synthetic data generation methods. The evaluation metrics and procedures are well-defined and implementable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) creating stage-specific curricula that truly capture the nuances of each moral development stage will be challenging and labor-intensive, (2) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of cultural variability in moral values, (3) human evaluation components will require significant resources and careful design to avoid biases, and (4) the sequential training through multiple stages will demand substantial computational resources despite efficiency measures. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do present notable implementation hurdles that could affect the timeline and scope of the research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI alignmentâ€”developing systems with more nuanced, context-sensitive moral reasoning capabilities. Its significance is substantial across multiple dimensions. For AI ethics and alignment, it offers a potentially transformative approach that moves beyond static, monolithic training methods toward a developmental framework that might produce more robust and adaptable ethical reasoning. The interdisciplinary nature of the work could foster valuable dialogue between AI researchers, philosophers, and psychologists, advancing all fields. The proposal directly addresses key workshop topics including alternatives to RLHF and concerns about monolithic value alignment. If successful, the research could significantly impact how we approach value alignment in AI systems, potentially leading to more trustworthy and ethically sound AI. The proposal also has theoretical significance for computational modeling of moral development, potentially offering new insights for moral psychology itself. While the initial implementation doesn't fully address cultural diversity in values, the framework provides a foundation that could eventually accommodate such diversity. The proposal's significance is somewhat limited by its initial focus on Western-centric moral development theories and the need for further work to fully address value pluralism, but overall, it represents an important contribution to a critical area of AI research."
