        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of applying moral philosophy and psychology theories to AI practices, specifically focusing on developmental moral psychology. The proposal elaborates comprehensively on the idea of 'Developmental Scaffolding for Moral AI' by creating a structured curriculum based on Kohlberg's stages of moral development. It incorporates insights from the literature review, citing works like Ganguli et al. (2023) on moral self-correction in LLMs, Tennant et al. (2023) on hybrid approaches to moral value alignment, and Endo (2025) on experiential learning cycles. The proposal also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as cultural variability in moral values and evaluation of moral reasoning capabilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the theoretical framework is thoroughly explained. The technical implementation section provides detailed mathematical formulations for the training procedures at each developmental stage. The experimental design is comprehensive, outlining three distinct experiments with clear evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the transition between stages could be more precisely defined with specific thresholds or metrics, (2) some technical details about the simulated social environments could be more concrete, and (3) the relationship between the mathematical formulations and the practical implementation could be further elaborated to ensure reproducibility."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach to AI value alignment by applying developmental psychology theories to AI training. While individual elements (such as curriculum learning or moral reasoning in AI) have been explored before, the comprehensive framework that systematically implements Kohlberg's stages of moral development into a progressive AI training methodology is novel. The stage-specific training procedures with tailored loss functions for each developmental phase represent a fresh perspective. The proposal also introduces innovative concepts like the simulated social environments for experiential moral learning and the stage progression criteria. The integration of pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional stages into a cohesive training framework distinguishes this work from existing approaches that typically implement ethics as a static overlay rather than a developmental process."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations from developmental psychology and machine learning. The adaptation of Kohlberg's moral development theory is well-justified, and the technical implementation includes appropriate mathematical formulations for the training objectives. The experimental design includes comparative evaluations and appropriate metrics for assessing moral reasoning quality. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal assumes that a staged approach will necessarily lead to better moral reasoning, but this causal relationship could be more rigorously justified; (2) while the mathematical formulations are presented, some details about how certain components (like the 'adherence to principles' function) would be implemented are not fully specified; (3) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the developmental approach. Despite these concerns, the overall methodology is rigorous and well-founded in both AI and psychological theory."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially implementable research agenda. The use of transformer-based language models with at least 7 billion parameters is reasonable given current capabilities, and the staged training approach is technically feasible. However, several significant implementation challenges exist: (1) creating appropriate datasets for each developmental stage that accurately reflect the progression of moral reasoning will require substantial effort and expertise; (2) designing effective simulated social environments that can provide meaningful experiential learning is complex and may require advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning; (3) the evaluation of moral reasoning quality relies partly on subjective human assessment, which may be resource-intensive and difficult to standardize; (4) the computational resources required for training large language models through multiple developmental stages would be substantial. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively represent significant practical hurdles that may require simplifications or compromises during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment approaches by introducing a developmental perspective to value learning. If successful, this research could significantly advance how we approach ethical AI by moving beyond static rule-based systems to more nuanced, context-sensitive moral reasoning. The potential impacts are substantial: (1) it could lead to AI systems with more sophisticated ethical reasoning capabilities that better align with human moral intuitions; (2) it addresses the challenge of ethical pluralism by incorporating diverse moral frameworks at appropriate developmental stages; (3) it could enhance generalization to novel ethical dilemmas, a key limitation of current approaches; (4) the insights gained could contribute to both AI alignment theory and our understanding of human moral development; (5) the approach could be particularly valuable for high-stakes domains requiring nuanced ethical judgment. The proposal directly addresses several key questions from the workshop topics, including how developmental moral psychology can inform AI development and how to incorporate pluralistic values into AI systems."
