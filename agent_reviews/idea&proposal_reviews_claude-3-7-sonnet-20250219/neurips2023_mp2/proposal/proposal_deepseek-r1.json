    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the application of moral psychology theories to AI practices, specifically focusing on developmental moral psychology as suggested in the task description. The proposal expands on the initial idea of 'Developmental Scaffolding for Moral AI' by providing a comprehensive framework that implements Kohlberg's stages of moral development through a curriculum-based approach. The literature review is well-integrated, with the proposal building upon concepts like inverse reinforcement learning from Oliveira et al., developmental support approaches from Endo, and curriculum learning mentioned in Lee & Kim's work. The proposal addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as cultural variability and evaluation of moral reasoning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-stage developmental framework (pre-conventional, conventional, post-conventional) is explained in detail with specific data sources, algorithms, and reward functions for each stage. The mathematical formulations of reward functions provide precise technical specifications. The experimental design, including baselines, datasets, and metrics, is thoroughly described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: the exact mechanism for determining when an agent should progress to the next stage could be more detailed, and the relationship between the proposed progression mechanism and the neural network architecture could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach to AI value alignment by applying developmental moral psychology theories to create a staged learning curriculum. This represents a significant departure from conventional RLHF methods that treat morality as static preferences to be imitated. The integration of Kohlberg's moral development stages into a computational framework with stage-specific reward functions is particularly novel. The proposal also introduces innovative elements such as the progression mechanism between stages and the use of debate-driven reinforcement learning for post-conventional reasoning. While some individual components (like IRL or curriculum learning) appear in the literature review, their combination and application to moral development in AI represents a fresh perspective. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced completely new algorithmic approaches rather than combining existing techniques in a novel way."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations by grounding its approach in established developmental psychology theories and machine learning techniques. The three-stage framework is well-justified and the mathematical formulations of reward functions are technically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, datasets, and metrics for evaluation. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) The transition between stages relies on performance thresholds without detailed justification for the 90% accuracy criterion; (2) The proposal assumes that moral development stages can be cleanly separated and sequentially learned, which may oversimplify the complex, non-linear nature of moral development; (3) While the reward functions are well-formulated, there's limited discussion of potential optimization challenges or convergence guarantees. These limitations somewhat reduce the overall soundness of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, it leverages existing techniques (supervised learning, RL, IRL) and datasets (MFQ, ETHICS benchmark) that are available and well-established. The stage-based curriculum provides a structured approach to implementation. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Creating appropriate datasets for each moral development stage, especially for diverse cultural contexts, would require extensive data collection and annotation efforts; (2) The simulation of social interactions for the conventional stage would be complex to implement realistically; (3) The proposed reward functions, while theoretically sound, may be difficult to optimize in practice, particularly the post-conventional stage's consistency with abstract principles; (4) Evaluating moral reasoning in AI systems remains challenging, and the proposed metrics may not fully capture the nuanced aspects of moral development. These challenges don't make the proposal impractical, but they do suggest significant implementation hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment practices by introducing a psychologically grounded framework for value alignment. Its significance is substantial for several reasons: (1) It directly tackles the limitations of current RLHF approaches by enabling AI systems to develop context-aware, nuanced moral frameworks rather than simply imitating human preferences; (2) The developmental approach could significantly improve AI's adaptability to novel ethical scenarios and cultural contexts, addressing a major challenge in AI ethics; (3) The framework provides a potential path toward more transparent and interpretable moral reasoning in AI systems, which is crucial for building societal trust; (4) The interdisciplinary nature of the work bridges developmental psychology and AI ethics, potentially advancing both fields; (5) The proposal has broad implications for policy, regulation, and the responsible deployment of AI in high-stakes domains. The expected improvements in generalization (15%) and cultural adaptability (20%) would represent meaningful advances in the field if achieved."
