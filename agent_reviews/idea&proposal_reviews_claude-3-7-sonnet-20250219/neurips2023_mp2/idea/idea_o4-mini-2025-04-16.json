        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses how theories from moral psychology (specifically Kohlberg's stages of moral development) can be applied to AI alignment, which is the central theme of the workshop. The proposal tackles several key topics mentioned in the task: applying developmental moral psychology to AI, addressing pluralistic values, proposing alternatives to RLHF, and considering how to incorporate diverse voices and values. The idea specifically addresses the concern about 'amplifying monolithic voices' by proposing a curriculum that embeds pluralistic values through diverse, crowd-sourced examples spanning cultures and demographics."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure. The three-phase approach mirroring Kohlberg's stages provides a concrete framework that is easy to understand. The motivation, main idea, and implementation steps are all logically presented. The only minor ambiguities lie in the specifics of how the abstract principles in the post-conventional phase would be operationalized into 'constraint-based learning and logic-driven loss functions,' and how exactly the collaboration with moral psychologists would be structured. These details would benefit from further elaboration, but the overall concept is presented with strong clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by applying Kohlberg's developmental moral psychology framework to AI alignment in a structured way. While both moral psychology and AI alignment have been discussed together before, the specific implementation of a three-phase curriculum that mirrors human moral development stages represents a fresh approach. The integration of pluralistic values through crowd-sourcing across cultures is particularly innovative compared to current alignment methods. The proposal to use constraint-based learning and logic-driven loss functions derived from moral philosophy for the post-conventional phase also represents a novel technical direction, though similar concepts have been explored in value alignment research."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. The pre-conventional phase seems straightforward to implement using existing reinforcement learning techniques. The conventional phase involving crowd-sourced examples across cultures is more challenging but still achievable with sufficient resources. However, the post-conventional phase presents significant technical hurdles in translating abstract moral principles into constraint-based learning and logic-driven loss functions. The proposal also requires collaboration with moral psychologists and creation of a labeled scenario bank, which adds complexity. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they would require considerable expertise, resources, and time to implement effectively, making the overall feasibility moderate rather than high."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI alignment that has far-reaching implications. Current alignment methods often produce brittle ethical judgments and amplify monolithic value sets, which could lead to harmful AI systems as they become more powerful and widespread. By providing a structured framework for developing moral competence in AI that incorporates pluralistic values, this research could significantly improve AI alignment approaches. The expected outcomes of enhanced generalization to unseen ethical challenges and greater transparency in value hierarchies would represent major advancements in the field. The creation of a replicable pipeline for ethically robust AI could influence how alignment is approached industry-wide, making this research potentially highly impactful."
