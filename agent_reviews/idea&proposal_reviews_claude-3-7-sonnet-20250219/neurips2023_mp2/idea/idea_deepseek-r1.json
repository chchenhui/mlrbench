    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of applying moral philosophy and psychology to AI practices. Specifically, it tackles several key topics mentioned in the task: pluralistic values in AI, alternatives to RLHF, incorporating diverse voices into AI alignment, and methodologies for teaching AI systems human values. The proposal's focus on moral foundations theory from psychology perfectly matches the call for cross-disciplinary work between AI and moral psychology. The only minor limitation is that it could more explicitly address how AI tools might advance moral philosophy/psychology themselves (one of the optional topics), though this isn't a significant omission given the proposal's comprehensive coverage of other priority areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured with clear components: motivation, methodology (combining moral foundations theory with co-design workshops), and expected outcomes. The proposal outlines a specific process flow from stakeholder engagement to value mapping to implementation in AI systems. The concept of using graph-based models to translate value weights into alignment constraints is presented coherently. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration - particularly how exactly the graph-based model would function, how the value weights would be mathematically represented, and how the system would 'dynamically adapt outputs' to different value profiles while maintaining consistency. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by proposing a novel integration of moral foundations theory with participatory design methodologies specifically for AI alignment. While both moral foundations theory and participatory design exist separately, their combination for creating pluralistic AI value systems represents an innovative approach. The proposal challenges the dominant RLHF paradigm with a decentralized alternative that explicitly addresses cultural diversity in values. The graph-based modeling approach for translating diverse moral priorities into technical alignment constraints appears to be a fresh contribution to the field. The focus on auditing existing systems for value diversity also represents a novel analytical framework that doesn't appear to be widely implemented in current AI ethics practices."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research faces moderate feasibility challenges. While the participatory workshops and value mapping components are clearly implementable with existing methodologies from social sciences, several technical hurdles exist. Translating qualitative moral values into quantitative 'weights' that can be meaningfully incorporated into AI training presents significant technical complexity. The graph-based model would require sophisticated design to handle potentially conflicting value systems across cultures. Additionally, ensuring that the AI system can 'dynamically adapt outputs' to different value profiles without inconsistency or manipulation would be challenging. The proposal would benefit from more concrete details on implementation strategies, particularly regarding how these value systems would integrate with existing AI architectures and training methodologies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical gap in current AI alignment approaches by tackling the homogenization of values and potential marginalization of non-dominant perspectives. The significance is particularly high given the rapid global deployment of AI systems across diverse cultural contexts. If successful, this work could fundamentally reshape how AI systems incorporate human values, potentially leading to more equitable and culturally responsive AI. The proposed toolkit for auditing value diversity in existing systems could become an essential resource for identifying and mitigating ethical biases. The modular architecture for pluralistic alignment could establish a new paradigm that challenges the centralized approach of current alignment methods. The work has both theoretical significance for AI ethics and practical importance for developing more inclusive AI systems."
