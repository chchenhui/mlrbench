    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on information-theoretic principles in cognitive systems, particularly the application of information theory to human-AI communication. The proposal builds upon the Information Bottleneck principle as suggested in the research idea, and extensively references the literature review materials, particularly Tucker et al. (2022) and the concept of VQ-VIB. The methodology incorporates variational information bottleneck methods within a reinforcement learning framework as outlined in the idea. The proposal also addresses the workshop's interest in interdisciplinary work by combining machine learning, cognitive science, and information theory approaches to study human-AI collaboration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly explained. The proposal effectively communicates the problem formulation, variational approximation, and integration with reinforcement learning. However, some technical aspects, particularly in the mathematical formulations of the variational approximation and policy gradients, could benefit from additional clarification for non-specialists. The relationship between the adaptive trade-off parameter and human cognitive load could also be elaborated further to strengthen clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by applying the Information Bottleneck principle specifically to human-AI communication in cooperative tasks. While IB methods have been used in multi-agent communication (Wang et al., 2020) and representation learning (Islam et al., 2023), the integration of adaptive IB trade-off parameters based on human cognitive feedback represents a novel contribution. The proposal extends Tucker et al.'s (2022) work on VQ-VIB by incorporating real-time adaptation mechanisms and human cognitive constraints. However, the core technical approach builds upon existing IB and RL methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The novelty lies more in the application domain and the integration of human factors than in the underlying mathematical framework."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The Information Bottleneck formulation is mathematically rigorous, and the variational approximation follows established methods. The integration with reinforcement learning is well-justified, and the adaptive trade-off parameter mechanism is theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and statistical analyses. The proposal correctly identifies the challenges in computing mutual information directly and adopts appropriate variational methods. However, some assumptions about the relationship between message complexity and human cognitive load could benefit from stronger theoretical justification based on cognitive science literature. The proposal could also more explicitly address potential limitations of the variational approximations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps. The implementation details are specific and realistic, with appropriate neural network architectures, optimization methods, and hyperparameters. The simulation environment and tasks (block-arrangement puzzle, search-and-retrieve) are well-defined and implementable. The human-subject experiment design is reasonable in scope (N=30-50) with appropriate metrics. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the real-time adaptation of the β parameter based on human feedback may be challenging to implement effectively; (2) the estimation of mutual information in high-dimensional spaces is notoriously difficult and may require substantial computational resources; and (3) the human studies may face practical challenges in controlling for individual differences in cognitive capacity and communication preferences."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in human-AI collaboration with potentially broad impact. Effective communication between humans and AI systems is crucial for numerous applications including healthcare, manufacturing, education, and emergency response. The proposed framework could significantly improve the efficiency and user experience of collaborative AI systems by reducing cognitive load while maintaining task performance. The interdisciplinary nature of the work, bridging information theory, reinforcement learning, and cognitive science, aligns well with the workshop's goals and could inspire further research at this intersection. The expected outcomes include both theoretical contributions (adaptive IB framework) and practical tools (open-source codebase) that could benefit the research community. While the immediate applications focus on specific cooperative tasks, the principles could generalize to a wide range of human-AI interaction scenarios."
