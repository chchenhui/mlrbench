        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the application of information theory (specifically mutual information) to human-agent communication, which falls under the topic of 'Application of information theory to training human-aligned artificial agents' mentioned in the task description. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposal connecting machine learning, cognitive science, and information theory perfectly matches the workshop's goal of bringing together researchers from multiple disciplines. The focus on measuring and optimizing communication using information-theoretic principles is highly relevant to the workshop's emphasis on computation/estimation of information-theoretic quantities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (ineffective human-AI communication), the proposed solution (mutual information framework), and the expected outcomes. The three-component structure (estimation, optimization, co-evolution) provides a well-defined roadmap for the research. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific methods for estimating mutual information in human-agent dialogues and how exactly the co-evolutionary approach would be implemented. Despite these minor ambiguities, the overall concept is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in applying mutual information specifically to human-agent communication. While mutual information is a well-established concept in information theory and has been applied in various machine learning contexts, its systematic application to optimize human-agent communication and the proposed co-evolutionary approach appear to be fresh perspectives. The integration of these elements into a comprehensive framework for enhancing human-aligned AI is innovative. However, the core information-theoretic principles themselves are not new, and similar approaches may have been explored in related domains, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea is satisfactory but faces some implementation challenges. Estimating mutual information in complex, high-dimensional settings like human-agent dialogues is notoriously difficult and often requires large amounts of data. The co-evolutionary approach, while theoretically sound, may be challenging to implement effectively in practice due to the complexity of human communication patterns and the need for real-time adaptation. Additionally, evaluating the success of such a framework would require careful experimental design and user studies. These challenges are significant but not insurmountable with appropriate resources and methodological innovations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses an important problem in AI alignment and human-AI interaction. Improving communication between humans and AI systems is crucial for developing trustworthy, user-friendly AI, which has broad implications across numerous applications. The information-theoretic approach provides a principled framework that could lead to meaningful contributions in understanding and optimizing human-agent interactions. The interdisciplinary nature of the work could foster valuable collaborations between machine learning, cognitive science, and information theory communities, as emphasized in the task description. The potential impact extends beyond theoretical contributions to practical improvements in AI systems that better align with human communication patterns."
