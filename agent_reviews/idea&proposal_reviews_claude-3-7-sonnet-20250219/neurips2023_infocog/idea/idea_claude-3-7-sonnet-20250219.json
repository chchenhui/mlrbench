        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the application of information-theoretic principles to cognitive systems, specifically focusing on language models as artificial cognitive systems. The proposal aims to compare information processing between LLMs and human cognition, which perfectly matches the workshop's goal of exploring 'an integrative computational theory of human and artificial cognition.' The idea touches on multiple topics explicitly mentioned in the task description, including novel information-theoretic approaches to cognitive functions (language, reasoning), methods for computation/estimation of information-theoretic quantities (through the proposed estimators), and applications to human-aligned AI. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposal connecting machine learning, cognitive science, and information theory also aligns with the workshop's stated interdisciplinary focus."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (black-box nature of LLMs), the proposed approach (applying information bottleneck theory to analyze representations), and the expected outcomes (quantifiable bounds on information retention). The methodology involving mutual information measurement between model activations and both inputs and downstream tasks is well-defined. However, there are some minor ambiguities that could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific estimators to be developed for high-dimensional neural representations and more details on how the 'targeted probing tasks' would be designed to align with cognitive science theories. While the overall framework is clear, these implementation details would strengthen the clarity further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its application of information bottleneck theory specifically to compare human and LLM information processing. While information theory has been applied to neural networks before, the focus on developing specialized estimators for high-dimensional LLM representations and the explicit connection to human cognitive processing patterns represents a fresh approach. The proposal to identify 'information-theoretic signatures of different cognitive functions' is particularly innovative. However, the core techniques (mutual information measurement, information bottleneck theory) are established in the field, and similar approaches have been explored in neural network interpretability, though perhaps not with this specific cognitive comparison focus. The idea offers a novel combination and application of existing concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new theoretical constructs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. On the positive side, information bottleneck theory is well-established, and there are existing methods for estimating mutual information that could serve as starting points. However, accurately estimating mutual information in high-dimensional spaces (like LLM activations) is notoriously difficult and often requires large amounts of data and computational resources. The proposal acknowledges this challenge by mentioning the need for specialized estimators, but developing these is non-trivial. Additionally, creating cognitive science-aligned probing tasks that reliably measure specific cognitive functions would require significant interdisciplinary expertise. The comparison between human and LLM information processing also assumes access to suitable human cognitive processing data, which may be limited or difficult to obtain in comparable formats. While the research direction is feasible, these practical challenges suggest considerable effort would be required for successful implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposed research has high significance for both theoretical understanding and practical applications. Theoretically, it addresses a fundamental gap in our understanding of how information flows through language models compared to human cognition, potentially yielding insights into both artificial and human intelligence. Practically, the quantifiable bounds on information retention could guide the development of more interpretable and human-aligned AI systems, directly addressing one of the most pressing challenges in modern AI research. The information-theoretic framework could provide a principled approach to interpretability that goes beyond current ad hoc methods. The interdisciplinary nature of the work could also foster valuable connections between machine learning, cognitive science, and information theory communities, exactly as highlighted in the task description. The potential impact on AI alignment and interpretability makes this research particularly timely and important."
