        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses information-theoretic principles in cognitive systems, which is the core focus of the InfoCog workshop. The proposal bridges machine learning and cognitive science by developing methods for estimating information-theoretic quantities in high-dimensional cognitive systems. It specifically targets the computation/estimation of information-theoretic measures (a highlighted topic of interest) and applies these to both human cognition (perceptual decision-making) and artificial agents (interpretability). The interdisciplinary nature of the proposal, connecting neural networks with cognitive principles, perfectly matches the workshop's goal of bringing together researchers from multiple disciplines."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (estimation of information-theoretic quantities in high-dimensional systems), proposes a specific solution approach (hybrid neural-variational framework with cognitive priors), and outlines validation methods and expected outcomes. The technical components are described with sufficient detail to understand the general approach. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific cognitive priors to be used and how exactly they will be integrated into the neural-variational framework. The connection between the method and the validation tasks could also be more explicitly defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel integration of cognitive principles into neural estimation methods for information dynamics. While neural estimators for information-theoretic quantities exist, and cognitive priors have been used in other contexts, the combination of these approaches specifically for time-varying information dynamics estimation appears innovative. The integration of attention sparsity and hierarchical processing as regularization constraints in information estimation is a fresh perspective. The interdisciplinary bridge between ML scalability and cognitive plausibility represents an original contribution to the field. However, each individual component (neural estimators, variational bounds, cognitive priors) has precedents in the literature, making this more of a novel combination than a fundamentally new approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Neural estimators for information-theoretic quantities and variational methods are established techniques, providing a solid foundation. The validation datasets (video-audio integration, RL agents) are available resources. However, several aspects increase complexity: (1) integrating cognitive priors into neural architectures in a principled way requires careful design, (2) estimating time-varying information dynamics in high dimensions remains technically challenging despite the proposed approach, (3) validating against neuroscience/behavioral data introduces additional complexity due to noise and variability in such data. The project would likely require substantial computational resources and interdisciplinary expertise, but these challenges appear surmountable with appropriate resources and collaborations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in both machine learning and cognitive science. Accurate estimation of information-theoretic quantities in high-dimensional, dynamic systems would significantly advance our understanding of both human and artificial cognition. The potential applications are far-reaching: improving interpretability of AI systems (addressing a major challenge in the field), enhancing models of human perception and decision-making, and providing tools for analyzing complex multi-agent systems. The proposed open-source toolkit would benefit researchers across disciplines, fostering collaboration between ML, cognitive science, and information theory communities - directly addressing the workshop's interdisciplinary goals. The work could lead to both theoretical advances in information theory and practical applications in cognitive modeling and AI development."
