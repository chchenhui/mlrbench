    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging the gap between computational predictions and experimental biology by developing an Adaptive Bayesian Generative Exploration (ABGE) framework that creates a closed-loop system between generative models and experimental feedback. The proposal incorporates key elements from the original idea, including the combination of variational autoencoders with Bayesian optimization, uncertainty quantification, and diversity metrics for candidate selection. It also thoroughly integrates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works (e.g., Calvanese et al., 2025; Doe & Smith, 2024; Johnson & Williams, 2024) and addressing identified challenges such as high false-positive rates and the need for adaptive experimental design. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal outlines a potential wet-lab case study, it primarily focuses on in silico validation, which is reasonable given the scope but could be expanded to more fully address the experimental track mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. It provides a comprehensive introduction that establishes the context and significance of the research, followed by detailed methodology sections that explain the technical components of the ABGE framework. The algorithmic details are particularly well-defined, with mathematical formulations for the VAE training, GP surrogate model, and acquisition functions. The experimental design for validation is thoroughly described, including specific oracles, baseline methods, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly articulated. The only areas that could benefit from slight refinement are: (1) some technical details in the VAE update section could be more concrete rather than presenting multiple options, and (2) the conceptual Figure 1 is only described textually rather than provided as an actual figure, which would enhance clarity. Overall, the proposal is highly understandable and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing approaches into a cohesive framework specifically tailored for protein engineering. The key novel aspects include: (1) the adaptive refinement of the VAE based on experimental feedback, which goes beyond standard Bayesian optimization approaches; (2) the diversity-driven batch selection strategy that balances exploration and exploitation; and (3) the closed-loop system that updates both the surrogate model and the generative model. While these individual components have precedents in the literature (as acknowledged through citations), their integration and specific application to protein engineering represents a fresh perspective. The proposal is not entirely groundbreaking, as it builds upon established methods like VAEs, GPs, and UCB acquisition functions, but it offers a thoughtful recombination and adaptation of these techniques to address a significant challenge in biomolecular design. The novelty lies more in the system-level integration and application rather than in fundamental algorithmic innovations."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the VAE (ELBO objective), GP surrogate model, and UCB acquisition function are correctly presented and well-justified. The batch selection strategy with diversity considerations is theoretically well-founded. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive, with appropriate oracles, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and offers multiple strategies for key components like the VAE update mechanism. The literature citations support the methodological choices. The only areas that could be strengthened are: (1) more detailed discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, particularly regarding the scalability of GPs for high-dimensional protein representations; (2) more specific justification for hyperparameter choices (e.g., the value of κ in UCB or λ in the diversity term); and (3) more rigorous theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed adaptive framework. Overall, the technical foundations are solid and the methodology is well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, particularly for the in silico validation phase. The computational components (VAE, GP, batch selection) utilize established methods with available implementations. The simulated fitness landscapes (oracles) mentioned are accessible and have been used in prior work. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and measurable. The proposal wisely stages the research, focusing first on computational validation before moving to wet-lab experiments, which reduces risk. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) training and updating VAEs on protein sequence data can be computationally intensive; (2) GPs typically scale poorly with dataset size (O(n³) complexity), which could become problematic as experimental data accumulates; (3) the proposed adaptive VAE update strategies need careful implementation to avoid overfitting to limited experimental data; and (4) the potential wet-lab case study, while well-conceived, would require significant resources and expertise not detailed in the proposal. The research is generally realistic but would benefit from more discussion of computational requirements and potential scalability solutions (e.g., sparse GPs, neural network surrogates as alternatives)."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in protein engineering: efficiently navigating the vast sequence space to discover proteins with desired properties. If successful, the ABGE framework could significantly reduce experimental costs (targeting up to 80% reduction) and accelerate the discovery of novel functional proteins, which would have substantial impact across medicine, industry, and environmental applications. The research directly contributes to the GEM workshop's goal of bridging computational and experimental approaches in biomolecular design. The proposal's significance is enhanced by its focus on creating a generalizable framework that could be applied to various protein engineering tasks and potentially extended to other biomolecules. The expected outcomes include not only the framework itself but also insights into effective strategies for integrating experimental feedback with generative models. While the immediate impact would be primarily in the research community, the long-term applications could be transformative for protein engineering practice. The proposal could have been strengthened by providing more specific examples of high-impact protein engineering targets where the approach could make a difference, but overall, the significance is well-established and compelling."
