    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of bridging the gap between computational and experimental approaches in biomolecular design, specifically focusing on antibody affinity maturation. The proposal incorporates the core elements from the research idea, including the integration of generative sequence models with active learning frameworks to guide experimental testing. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing key challenges such as data scarcity, computational complexity, and the need for effective integration of experimental data. The methodology section clearly outlines a closed-loop process that iteratively refines both generative and predictive models using wet-lab experimental results, which is consistent with the active learning approaches discussed in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-articulated and structured logically, making it easy to follow. The research objectives are clearly defined, and the methodology section provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed approach. The experimental design is well-described, with clear steps for data collection, model training, active learning process, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification. For instance, the proposal could provide more specific details about the acquisition function to be used in the active learning framework and how it will balance exploration and exploitation. Additionally, while the proposal mentions using techniques such as yeast display or surface plasmon resonance for experimental testing, it could provide more details about the experimental setup and protocols. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity of the proposal is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating generative sequence models with active learning frameworks specifically for antibody affinity maturation. While individual components (generative models, active learning, affinity prediction) have been explored in the literature, the comprehensive closed-loop system that iteratively refines both generative and predictive models using wet-lab experimental results represents a fresh approach. The literature review shows similar work in this direction (e.g., papers 1, 2, 5, and 8), but the proposal distinguishes itself by focusing specifically on the integration of wet-lab validation within the active learning loop for antibody affinity maturation. However, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithms or methods beyond what's already being explored in the field, which prevents it from receiving a higher novelty score. The innovation lies more in the integration and application of existing techniques rather than in developing entirely new methodological approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. It leverages established generative sequence models (ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF) and active learning frameworks, which have proven effective in related domains. The methodology is well-justified and follows a logical progression from model training to experimental validation and iterative refinement. The evaluation metrics proposed are appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of the approach. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges in the field, such as data scarcity and computational complexity, which demonstrates awareness of potential limitations. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from more rigorous treatment. For example, the proposal could provide more details about how the predictive model for binding affinity will be designed and trained, including specific architectures and loss functions. Additionally, while the proposal mentions balancing exploration and exploitation in the acquisition function, it doesn't specify how this balance will be achieved mathematically. Despite these minor limitations, the overall technical soundness of the proposal is strong."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant resources and expertise. The generative sequence models mentioned (ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF) are publicly available and have been successfully applied to protein design tasks. The active learning framework, while complex, is implementable using existing machine learning libraries. The experimental techniques mentioned (yeast display, SPR) are standard in the field of antibody engineering. However, there are several challenges that may impact feasibility. First, the iterative nature of the approach requires close integration between computational and experimental teams, which can be logistically challenging. Second, the wet-lab experiments for measuring binding affinities are time-consuming and expensive, which may limit the number of iterations possible within a reasonable timeframe. Third, the proposal doesn't address potential issues with protein expression and stability, which are critical for successful antibody engineering. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is feasible with appropriate resources and expertise, though it may require more time and funding than implied in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in therapeutic antibody development: the time-consuming and costly process of experimental screening for high-affinity variants. By integrating computational design with active learning to guide experimental efforts, the research has the potential to significantly accelerate the discovery of potent antibodies for therapeutic applications. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of bridging the gap between computational and experimental approaches in biomolecular design. The impact extends beyond just antibody design, as the proposed methodology could be adapted to other biomolecular design problems where the integration of in silico design and wet lab validation is crucial. The potential to reduce the time and cost of therapeutic antibody development has significant implications for addressing medical challenges and improving patient outcomes. The proposal also contributes to advancing the field of machine learning for biology by demonstrating how generative models and active learning can be effectively integrated with experimental workflows. The significance is further enhanced by the growing importance of therapeutic antibodies in treating various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases."
