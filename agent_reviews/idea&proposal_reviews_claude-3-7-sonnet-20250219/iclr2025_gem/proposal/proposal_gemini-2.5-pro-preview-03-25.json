    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the GEM workshop's goal of bridging the gap between computational methods and experimental biology by proposing an Iterative Generative Active Learning (IGAL) framework that combines generative models with active learning to guide experimental antibody design. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the integration of generative sequence models (ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF) with active learning for antibody affinity maturation. It thoroughly references and builds upon the literature review, citing all ten papers and incorporating their methodologies where relevant. The proposal maintains consistency throughout, from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes, all focused on the core challenge of efficiently bridging in silico design with experimental validation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the overall framework is logically presented with a step-by-step explanation of the iterative process. Technical concepts like acquisition functions are explained with mathematical formulations, making the approach transparent. The proposal clearly defines the problem (inefficiency in linking computational design with experimental validation) and presents a coherent solution. The only minor limitations are that some technical details in the methodology section could benefit from more concrete examples, and the relationship between the generative model refinement and the active learning component could be more explicitly defined. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible and follows a logical flow that makes the research plan easy to understand."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by integrating several existing approaches into a cohesive framework specifically designed for antibody affinity maturation. While individual components like generative models for protein design and active learning for experimental guidance have been explored separately (as acknowledged in references to papers like Gessner et al. and Amin et al.), the proposal's innovation lies in creating a tightly integrated, iterative loop that combines uncertainty-aware active learning with generative models in a closed feedback system. The comparison of different acquisition functions (Uncertainty Sampling, Expected Improvement, Upper Confidence Bound) specifically for antibody design represents a novel application. However, the core techniques themselves are adaptations of established methods rather than fundamentally new approaches, which limits the highest level of novelty. The proposal acknowledges this by positioning itself as building upon recent related works while focusing on the integration and application to the specific problem of antibody affinity maturation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The theoretical foundations are solid, drawing appropriately from established techniques in machine learning and computational biology. The mathematical formulations of acquisition functions are correctly presented, and the overall framework follows sound principles of active learning and generative modeling. The experimental design for validation is well thought out, with appropriate baselines (random sampling, greedy selection) and evaluation metrics. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and offers multiple options for implementation (e.g., different generative models, different approaches to uncertainty quantification). The in silico validation approach using an oracle function is particularly well-conceived, allowing for systematic evaluation before potential wet-lab implementation. The only minor limitation is that some specific details about model architectures and hyperparameter selection are left somewhat open, though this is reasonable given the proposal stage."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with a thoughtful approach to implementation. The in silico validation strategy using oracle functions is particularly practical, allowing for thorough testing without immediate reliance on expensive wet-lab experiments. The computational requirements are acknowledged, noting the need for HPC resources with GPU acceleration. The proposal offers multiple implementation options for each component (generative models, predictive models, acquisition functions), providing flexibility if certain approaches prove challenging. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and measurable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the computational cost of structure-based calculations could be prohibitive for large-scale exploration; (2) the refinement of generative models after each round might be challenging with limited new data points; and (3) the optional wet-lab validation would require significant additional resources and expertise not fully elaborated in the proposal. Overall, the core computational framework appears feasible, especially with the staged approach starting with in silico validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in therapeutic antibody development - the inefficiency of current workflows linking computational design with experimental validation. If successful, the IGAL framework could substantially reduce the time and resources required for antibody affinity maturation, accelerating the development of new therapeutics. This directly aligns with the GEM workshop's goal of making ML research more impactful in real-world biological applications. The proposal clearly articulates its potential impact on therapeutic development, basic research, and ML methodology. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's focus on a practical framework that could be adopted by researchers in both academia and industry. The approach could also be extended to other protein engineering problems beyond antibodies. While the initial impact might be limited to computational demonstrations, the potential for real-world application through collaboration with experimental partners is well-articulated. The significance is somewhat tempered only by the fact that the initial validation is in silico rather than demonstrating immediate wet-lab impact."
