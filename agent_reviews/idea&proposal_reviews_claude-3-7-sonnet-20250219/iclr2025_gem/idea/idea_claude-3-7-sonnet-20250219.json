        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on bridging the gap between computational methods and experimental biology. It directly addresses the 'Model interpretability' topic listed in the ML track while also considering the needs of experimentalists, which is a core theme of the GEM workshop. The proposal specifically mentions creating an 'interactive interface where experimentalists can explore design rationales,' which addresses the workshop's goal of bringing computationalists and experimentalists together. The idea also incorporates experimental feedback loops, which aligns with the workshop's interest in adaptive experimental design. The only minor limitation is that while it implies experimental validation would be improved, it doesn't explicitly mention including wet lab results, which would be valuable for the biology track."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (black-box nature of current deep learning approaches for protein design), proposes a specific solution (multi-scale interpretable framework), and outlines three distinct levels of interpretability (sequence, structural, and functional). The integration of these components into an interactive interface is also well-described. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific attention mechanisms to be used, how the graph neural networks will achieve built-in explainability, and how uncertainty will be modeled and quantified. Additionally, the method for incorporating experimental feedback into the model improvement process could be more precisely defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel integration of multiple interpretability approaches across different biological scales, which is not commonly seen in protein design systems. The three-level approach (sequence, structural, and functional) represents a fresh perspective on comprehensive interpretability. The interactive interface for experimentalist feedback is also innovative in this context. However, each individual component (attention mechanisms, explainable GNNs, uncertainty modeling) has been explored in various contexts before. The novelty lies more in the integration and application to protein design rather than in developing fundamentally new interpretability techniques. The approach builds upon existing methods in a thoughtful way rather than proposing entirely new algorithms or frameworks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed research is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Attention mechanisms and graph neural networks are well-established techniques, and there has been significant progress in making these models more interpretable. The integration of these components is challenging but achievable. The interactive interface for experimentalist feedback is also technically feasible. However, there are some practical challenges: (1) achieving meaningful functional-level interpretability that truly connects to molecular functions is difficult and may require extensive validation; (2) effectively incorporating experimental feedback into model improvement requires careful design of the feedback mechanism; and (3) balancing interpretability with performance might be challenging, as more interpretable models sometimes sacrifice predictive power. These challenges are significant but not insurmountable with proper research design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in the field of protein design. The black-box nature of current deep learning approaches is indeed a major limitation for experimental biologists, and improving interpretability could significantly accelerate the translation of computational designs into functional biomolecules. The multi-scale approach is particularly valuable as it provides insights at different levels of biological organization. If successful, this work could substantially improve the efficiency of the protein design process by reducing the number of designs requiring experimental testing while increasing success rates. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of bridging computational and experimental approaches. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in medicine, biotechnology, and environmental science where engineered proteins play crucial roles."
