    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) and its connections to representation learning and self-supervised learning. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including the two-stage framework with self-supervised goal representation learning followed by GCRL policy learning, and the context-aware contrastive loss. The methodology thoroughly builds upon the cited literature, particularly drawing from works on contrastive abstraction (Patil et al., 2024), hierarchical attention networks (White et al., 2023), and JaxGCRL (Bortkiewicz et al., 2024). The proposal also addresses the workshop's interest in applications beyond standard domains by including molecular generation tasks alongside robotics benchmarks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the architecture, loss functions, and experimental design. Mathematical formulations are presented with appropriate notation and context. The proposal effectively communicates both the high-level approach and technical details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for fine-tuning the encoder during policy learning could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the context-aware weighting and the theoretical benefits for subgoal abstraction could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some of the hyperparameter choices could be better justified with respect to the specific domains."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a context-aware contrastive loss that specifically weights temporally distant but causally related states/goals. This approach to capturing long-horizon relationships in goal representations is a fresh perspective. The integration of hierarchical attention encoders with GCRL is also innovative. However, the core components—contrastive learning for representation, goal relabeling, and actor-critic methods—build heavily on existing approaches in the literature. The proposal combines these elements in a new way rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The application to both continuous control and molecular generation domains shows breadth, but these applications have been explored in prior work. The proposal offers incremental but meaningful advances rather than a revolutionary approach."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks. The contrastive learning approach is mathematically well-formulated, with clear loss functions and optimization procedures. The integration with Soft Actor-Critic follows standard practices in the field. The context-aware weighting mechanism has a clear mathematical formulation and intuitive justification. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and includes strategies to address them, such as early stopping to prevent overfitting. The only minor concerns are: (1) the theoretical analysis of how the context-aware contrastive loss promotes abstraction is mentioned but not fully developed, and (2) some assumptions about the transferability of representations across very different domains (robotics vs. molecular design) could benefit from stronger justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The authors specify concrete benchmarks (Meta-World and 3D Molecular Graph Generation), computational resources (NVIDIA A100 GPUs), and reasonable time estimates for experiments (12-24 hours per run). The implementation builds on established frameworks like SAC and contrastive learning. The hyperparameter search space is well-defined and manageable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the integration of the hierarchical attention encoder with dynamic goal relabeling may require significant engineering effort, (2) the molecular generation tasks with discrete bond addition actions may present unique challenges not fully addressed in the methodology, and (3) the fine-tuning of the encoder during policy learning could lead to instability if not carefully managed. Overall, the proposal is implementable but will require careful optimization and potentially some adjustments during execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses important challenges in GCRL—sample inefficiency and poor generalization—that have significant implications for the field. If successful, the approach could substantially reduce the sample complexity (projected 2-3× reduction) and improve generalization (10-20% improvement) in sparse-reward environments. The potential applications span robotics, molecular design, and precision medicine, aligning well with the workshop's interests in broadening GCRL applications. The interpretable latent spaces could facilitate causal reasoning about goal achievement, addressing one of the workshop's explicit questions. The bridge between representation learning and GCRL contributes to the theoretical understanding of both fields. While the impact is substantial within the GCRL community, it may not be transformative for the broader AI field, as it builds on and extends existing paradigms rather than creating entirely new ones."
