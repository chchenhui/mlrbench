    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) and its connections to self-supervised learning and representation learning. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including the two-stage framework with self-supervised goal representation learning and the context-aware contrastive loss. It builds upon the literature review by citing relevant works (e.g., JaxGCRL, hierarchical attention networks) and addressing identified challenges like sparse rewards and sample inefficiency. The application domains (robotics and molecular design) match those mentioned in the workshop description. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions works by specific authors (e.g., White et al., 2023), the proposal references them without fully elaborating on how their specific contributions are incorporated."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with distinct sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The hierarchical attention encoder, context-aware contrastive loss, and dynamic goal relabeling mechanisms are all well-defined. The experimental design specifies environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for how the SSL-derived embeddings are integrated into the SAC algorithm could be more precisely defined, (2) the process for generating negative pairs in the contrastive learning setup could be more detailed, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'metric-shared representations') are used without full explanation of their meaning."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts in a novel way. The hierarchical contrastive learning module for goal-state representations and the context-aware contrastive loss that aligns temporally distant goals are innovative contributions. The dynamic goal relabeling approach based on SSL-derived embeddings also represents a fresh perspective. However, many of the individual components build upon existing work in contrastive learning, hierarchical attention, and goal relabeling (as seen in the literature review). The proposal acknowledges this by citing relevant prior work like JaxGCRL and hierarchical GCRL. While the integration is novel and potentially impactful, the core technical innovations are evolutionary rather than revolutionary, representing meaningful extensions of existing approaches rather than fundamentally new paradigms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the contrastive loss, temporal consistency term, and Q-value computation are correctly presented and well-justified. The two-stage approach (SSL followed by GCRL) is logically structured and builds upon established methods like Soft Actor-Critic and contrastive learning. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The hierarchical attention mechanism is well-motivated for capturing both temporal and relational dependencies. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) the choice of temperature parameter Ï„ in the contrastive loss and how it affects learning, (2) the theoretical guarantees for convergence when combining the SSL module with SAC, and (3) more detailed analysis of how the approach addresses the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in sparse-reward settings."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant implementation effort. The use of established environments (Meta-World, molecular generation) and algorithms (SAC, contrastive learning) increases feasibility. The two-stage approach allows for modular development and testing. However, several challenges may arise: (1) training transformer-based hierarchical attention models can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional state spaces in robotics or molecular domains; (2) the dynamic goal relabeling strategy might introduce instability in policy learning if not carefully implemented; (3) the expected 30-50% reduction in training samples seems optimistic without preliminary results; and (4) zero-shot transfer across substantially different tasks (e.g., from molecular design to robotics) may be more difficult than anticipated. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contribution of each component, which will help address implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses important challenges in GCRL with potentially broad impact. If successful, it would advance both theoretical understanding (bridging SSL and GCRL) and practical applications (improving sample efficiency and generalization). The approach could significantly reduce the need for reward engineering in complex domains like molecular design and robotics, which is a major bottleneck in current RL applications. The interpretable latent spaces could provide insights into causal goal reasoning, addressing a key question from the workshop description. The potential 30-50% reduction in training samples would make GCRL more accessible for real-world applications. The significance extends to multiple domains mentioned in the workshop (robotics, molecular design, precision medicine). However, the impact might be somewhat limited by the focus on specific environments (Meta-World, molecular generation) rather than a broader range of applications, and the improvements, while substantial, build incrementally on existing approaches rather than representing a paradigm shift."
