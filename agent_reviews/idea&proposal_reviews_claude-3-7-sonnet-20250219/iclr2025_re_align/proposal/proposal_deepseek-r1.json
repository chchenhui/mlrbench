        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the central theme of the Re-Align workshop by exploring when and why intelligent systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposed prototypical contrastive alignment framework fulfills the original idea of creating semantically meaningful 'anchor' vectors and using them for both measurement and intervention. The methodology incorporates joint clustering and prototypical contrastive loss as outlined in the idea. The proposal also engages with the literature review, citing relevant works like Muttenthaler et al. (2022) and building upon concepts like PCL (Li et al., 2020). It addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly the lack of interpretable anchors (Challenge 1), limited generalizability (Challenge 2), and intervention mechanisms (Challenge 5). The only minor inconsistency is that some cited papers in the proposal (e.g., Schaeffer et al., 2024) don't appear in the provided literature review, but this doesn't significantly impact the overall alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically connected to the methodology. The technical approach is presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the prototypical contrastive loss and joint clustering process understandable. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is well-defined. The expected outcomes are specific and quantifiable. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the joint prototype discovery and the prototypical contrastive loss could be more explicitly connected; (2) The process of transferring prototypes from the joint space to the individual DNN and brain spaces could be elaborated; and (3) Some technical details about the implementation of the modified k-means algorithm for joint clustering could be further explained. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is clear and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of prototypical contrastive learning (from Li et al., 2020) with brain-DNN alignment is innovative and not well-explored in the literature. The joint clustering approach to discover shared prototypes across biological and artificial systems offers a fresh perspective on representational alignment. The dual use of prototypes as both measurement tools and intervention mechanisms is particularly novel. However, the core technical components (prototypical contrastive learning, joint clustering, representational similarity) are adaptations of existing methods rather than fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal builds incrementally on established techniques like RSA, CKA, and PCL rather than introducing an entirely new paradigm. While the combination and application are innovative, the individual components draw heavily from prior work, limiting the highest level of novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for joint clustering and prototypical contrastive loss are well-defined and theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (RSA, CKA, ReAlnet) and multiple evaluation metrics that address different aspects of alignment (neural predictivity, task transfer, behavioral alignment). The implementation details are specific and realistic. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and provides parameters that can be tuned (α for balancing DNN and brain contributions, λ for alignment strength). The methodology builds logically on established techniques in representation learning and neural data analysis. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) The justification for using PCA rather than other dimensionality reduction techniques is not provided; (2) The statistical analysis plan for comparing results against baselines could be more detailed; and (3) The proposal could more thoroughly address potential confounds in the neural data collection and preprocessing. Despite these minor limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The data requirements (10,000 images, 50 human subjects) are ambitious but within the scope of contemporary neuroscience studies. The computational methods (joint clustering, contrastive learning) are implementable with current technology and have precedents in the literature. The evaluation metrics are measurable and the baselines are appropriate. However, there are several feasibility concerns: (1) Collecting high-quality fMRI or EEG data from 50 subjects viewing 10,000 images represents a significant resource investment; (2) The joint clustering approach may face challenges with the vastly different dimensionalities and statistical properties of neural and DNN representations; (3) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the temporal aspects of neural data (especially for EEG); and (4) The computational resources required for fine-tuning large vision models like ViT with the additional contrastive loss could be substantial. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that would require careful planning and potentially additional resources to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in the field of representational alignment with potentially high impact. If successful, the prototypical contrastive alignment framework would provide both interpretable measurement and effective intervention mechanisms for brain-DNN alignment, addressing key challenges identified in the literature. The expected outcomes include substantial improvements in neural predictivity (15-20% over baselines) and behavioral alignment, which would represent meaningful progress. The framework bridges multiple disciplines (machine learning, neuroscience, cognitive science) and directly addresses the themes of the Re-Align workshop. The practical applications in domains like medical imaging and human-computer interaction are well-justified. The proposal also engages with broader ethical implications of alignment, particularly through the explicit control over alignment strength. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on visual representations, which may not generalize to other modalities or cognitive domains. Additionally, while the proposal promises improved alignment, it doesn't fully explore the theoretical implications for understanding shared computational strategies between biological and artificial systems. Despite these limitations, the overall significance of the proposal is high, with clear potential to advance the field."
