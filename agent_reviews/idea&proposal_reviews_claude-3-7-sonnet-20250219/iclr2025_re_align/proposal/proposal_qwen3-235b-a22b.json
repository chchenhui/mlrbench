    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the central theme of the Re-Align workshop by investigating when and why intelligent systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The two-stage prototypical contrastive learning approach matches exactly with the main idea outlined in the research idea section. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including representational similarity analysis, prototypical contrastive learning, and joint clustering methods. It cites relevant works mentioned in the literature review (e.g., Lu et al., 2024; Mahner et al., 2024; Li et al., 2020) and addresses the key challenges identified, particularly the lack of interpretable anchors and intervention mechanisms. The only minor inconsistency is that some references mentioned in the proposal (e.g., Sucholutsky et al., 2023; Cloos et al., 2024) appear in the task description but not in the literature review, though this doesn't significantly impact the overall coherence."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is described in a logical sequence with appropriate technical details. The two-stage approach (prototype discovery followed by prototypical contrastive learning) is well-articulated with mathematical formulations that enhance precision. The experimental design section clearly outlines baseline comparisons, metrics, and statistical validation approaches. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact process of mapping between brain and DNN prototypes could be more explicitly defined, (2) the prototype pruning process could be elaborated with more specific criteria, and (3) some technical details about the projection head architecture are missing. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is well-articulated and immediately understandable to someone familiar with the field."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining prototypical contrastive learning with brain-DNN alignment, which appears to be a novel integration. The two-stage framework that first establishes semantic anchors through joint clustering and then uses these as targets for contrastive learning offers a fresh perspective on the alignment problem. The approach of using prototypes as both measurement tools and intervention mechanisms is innovative within this domain. However, the core techniques (prototypical contrastive learning, joint clustering, representational similarity) are adapted from existing methods rather than being entirely new inventions. The proposal builds upon established work by Li et al. (2020) on prototypical contrastive learning and extends it to the brain-DNN alignment context. While this combination is novel, it represents an incremental rather than revolutionary advance. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work like RSA-based alignment and ReAlnet by emphasizing interpretable anchors and intervention capabilities."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for normalization and the prototypical contrastive loss function are correctly presented and well-justified. The approach builds upon established methods in contrastive learning and representational similarity analysis, providing a solid theoretical grounding. The experimental design includes appropriate baseline comparisons, multiple evaluation metrics, and statistical validation procedures, which strengthen the methodological rigor. The two-stage framework is logically structured, with each component building upon the previous one. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional justification: (1) the choice of k-means for joint clustering could be compared with alternatives, (2) the selection of the number of prototypes K lacks specific criteria, and (3) the assumption that joint clustering will yield semantically meaningful prototypes could be more thoroughly justified. Despite these minor limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it does present some implementation challenges. The data requirements are reasonable, with the proposal mentioning the use of publicly available datasets (BOLD5000, Algonauts Project) alongside new experiments. The computational methods (k-means clustering, contrastive learning) are well-established and implementable with current tools. The evaluation metrics are clearly defined and measurable. However, several aspects may require additional resources or refinement: (1) collecting paired brain-DNN data at scale could be resource-intensive, (2) ensuring that joint clustering yields semantically meaningful prototypes may require iterative refinement, (3) the prototype pruning process based on human semantic ratings introduces a subjective element that could complicate implementation, and (4) the projection head design and training procedure may require careful tuning. While these challenges are significant, they don't fundamentally undermine the feasibility of the approach, making it a realistic proposal with manageable risks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in the field of representational alignment between biological and artificial systems. Its significance lies in three key contributions: (1) providing interpretable semantic anchors that bridge brain and DNN representations, (2) offering a mechanism for both measuring and intervening in alignment, and (3) advancing understanding of shared computational principles across biological and artificial systems. The expected outcomes include concrete improvements in neural predictivity (≥15% over RSA baselines) and feature attribution alignment (Δr ≥ 0.2), which would represent meaningful advances. The proposal also has broader impacts in neuroscience applications (e.g., neurodisorder diagnosis, BCIs) and AI safety (value alignment). The work directly addresses the workshop's goals of developing robust, generalizable measures of alignment and methods for systematically increasing representational alignment. While the impact may not be transformative for the entire field of AI or neuroscience, it represents a significant contribution to the specific domain of representational alignment with clear practical applications."
