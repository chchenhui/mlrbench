        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the central theme of when and why intelligence systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposal to incorporate representational alignment metrics into training loss functions specifically tackles the question 'How can we systematically increase (or decrease) representational alignment among biological and artificial systems?' The idea also touches on understanding the implications of increasing/decreasing alignment and developing more robust measures of alignment. The only minor aspect not fully addressed is the hackathon component's focus on comparing different alignment metrics, though the research would contribute valuable insights to that discussion."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (lack of methods to proactively induce/reduce alignment), proposes a specific solution (incorporating alignment metrics into training loss), and outlines expected outcomes. The mechanics of implementation are described through the use of regularization terms that penalize or reward representational similarity. However, there could be more specificity about which alignment metrics would be most suitable for incorporation into loss functions, how the regularization terms would be weighted against primary task objectives, and what specific conceptual dimensions might be targeted for alignment/divergence. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by shifting from post-hoc observation of alignment to proactive control during training. While representational alignment metrics like CKA and RSA are established, incorporating them directly into training objectives as a way to control alignment is a fresh approach. The concept of selectively targeting specific data subsets or conceptual dimensions for alignment adds further innovation. However, the approach builds significantly on existing alignment metrics and regularization techniques rather than introducing entirely new methodological frameworks. Similar ideas of incorporating representational similarity into training have been explored in knowledge distillation and some neuroscience-inspired ML approaches, though not with the specific focus on controllable alignment described here."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. The alignment metrics mentioned (CKA, RSA) are well-established and implementable. Adding regularization terms to loss functions is a standard practice in deep learning. The primary technical challenges would involve efficiently computing alignment metrics during training (which can be computationally expensive for large models) and balancing the alignment objectives with primary task performance. The proposal to analyze trade-offs with primary task performance acknowledges this challenge. The research could be implemented with existing deep learning frameworks and would not require novel computational resources or theoretical breakthroughs, making it quite practical to pursue."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in our understanding of representational alignment and could have substantial impact across multiple fields. For interpretability research, it offers a way to make models more transparent by aligning their representations with more interpretable systems. For neuroscience, it provides a method to create AI systems that better match biological processing, potentially advancing brain-computer interfaces and computational neuroscience models. For transfer learning and multi-modal systems, controlled alignment could improve knowledge transfer. The ability to systematically study the functional consequences of alignment addresses a fundamental question in the field. The approach could become a standard tool for researchers studying representational alignment across disciplines, making it highly significant."
