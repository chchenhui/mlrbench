        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the central theme of when and why intelligence systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposed prototypical contrastive alignment method offers both a measurement approach (addressing 'what measurement approaches should we explore next') and an intervention mechanism (addressing 'how can we systematically increase representational alignment'). The idea also touches on the implications of alignment for behavioral alignment, which is another key question in the task description. The only minor aspect not explicitly addressed is the negative implications of alignment, though the overall focus on improving alignment is clearly within scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear two-stage methodology: (1) joint clustering to define semantic prototypes and (2) training with a prototypical contrastive loss. The purpose and expected outcomes are well-defined, including improved neural predictivity and behavioral alignment. The technical approach using contrastive learning is specified with sufficient detail. However, some minor ambiguities remain: the exact clustering method is not specified, the evaluation metrics could be more precisely defined, and the exact nature of the 'semantic prototypes' could benefit from further elaboration. These are relatively minor issues that don't significantly impede understanding of the core idea."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining several existing concepts in a new way. While contrastive learning and representational alignment are established areas, the specific innovation of using jointly-derived prototypes as semantic anchors for both measurement and intervention is relatively fresh. The two-fold application of the prototypical framework (as both metric and regularizer) is a creative approach. However, the core techniques (contrastive learning, clustering, representation alignment) are well-established in the field, and similar prototype-based approaches have been explored in related contexts. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and application rather than introducing fundamentally new methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is highly feasible with current technology and methods. The required data (paired DNN activations and neural responses) is available through existing datasets, and the technical components (clustering, contrastive learning, fine-tuning) are well-established with mature implementations. The evaluation metrics mentioned (neural predictivity, task transfer, behavioral alignment) are standard in the field. The main implementation challenges would be in the details of the joint clustering approach and ensuring the prototypes are truly meaningful across both domains. The computational requirements seem reasonable, especially since the approach focuses on fine-tuning rather than training from scratch. Overall, this idea could be implemented with existing resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses an important problem in the field of representational alignment between biological and artificial systems. Its significance stems from offering both measurement and intervention capabilities within a unified framework, which directly addresses key questions in the task description. The potential impact includes: (1) more interpretable alignment metrics through semantic prototypes, (2) a concrete method to increase alignment during model training, and (3) insights into shared computational strategies between brains and DNNs. The approach could lead to models with more human-like representations, which has implications for explainability and potentially for alignment with human values. While not revolutionary, this work could make a substantial contribution to the field and influence future research directions in brain-DNN alignment."
