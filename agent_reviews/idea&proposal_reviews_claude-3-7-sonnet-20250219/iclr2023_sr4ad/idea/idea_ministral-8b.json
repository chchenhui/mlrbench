    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses representation learning for autonomous driving, focusing on multi-modal scene representations that integrate perception, prediction, and planning - a key topic mentioned in the task. The proposal specifically tackles the integration of traditional sub-components through its sensor fusion approach, and explicitly incorporates safety and interpretability concerns through its dedicated module. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly discuss benchmarking environments or datasets, though it implies evaluation would be part of the research."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure that outlines the motivation, main components, and expected outcomes. The three-module architecture (Sensor Fusion, Contextual Embedding, and Interpretability/Safety) is well-defined with specific technical approaches mentioned for each (attention mechanisms, transformer architecture, explainable AI). However, some minor ambiguities exist regarding the specific implementation details, evaluation metrics, and how the modules would interact with each other in practice. More concrete details on the exact neural network architectures and training methodology would further enhance clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its comprehensive approach to multi-modal scene representation. While sensor fusion and transformer-based architectures are established techniques in autonomous driving, the integration of these components into a unified framework with explicit focus on interpretability and safety represents a fresh perspective. The attention-based weighting of sensor inputs based on driving scenarios and the explicit incorporation of explainable AI for safety are particularly innovative aspects. However, each individual component builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms, which limits the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. All the proposed components (sensor fusion, transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and explainable AI techniques) are established areas with available implementations and research literature. The integration of these components presents challenges but is achievable with current deep learning frameworks. The modular design also allows for incremental development and testing. The main implementation challenges would likely be in the real-time performance requirements for autonomous driving and the complexity of integrating multiple sensors with different characteristics, but these are manageable with current hardware and optimization techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in autonomous driving: the effective integration of multi-modal data for robust scene understanding. If successful, it could significantly advance the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles - a field with enormous societal and economic impact. The focus on interpretability and safety is particularly significant given the regulatory and public trust concerns surrounding autonomous driving. The research could bridge important gaps between perception, prediction, and planning that currently limit autonomous systems. While highly significant, it stops short of a revolutionary paradigm shift in the field, which would warrant the highest score."
