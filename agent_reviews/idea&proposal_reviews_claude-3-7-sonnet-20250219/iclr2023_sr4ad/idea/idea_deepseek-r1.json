    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses multiple key aspects mentioned in the workshop overview: it proposes a unified representation learning approach for autonomous driving (first bullet point), explicitly focuses on joint perception and prediction (second bullet point), incorporates interpretability mechanisms (third bullet point), and mentions evaluation on established datasets like nuScenes (fourth bullet point). The only minor limitation is that it doesn't strongly address the 'new perspectives on the future of autonomous driving' aspect, though it does imply future implications for regulatory compliance and safety."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a specific architecture (transformer-based), clear inputs (multi-modal sensor data), and defined outputs (detected objects and trajectories). The three key innovations are well-articulated and distinct. The evaluation approach is also specified with concrete metrics. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for example, how exactly the multi-task attention mechanisms will align spatial-temporal features, or how the contrastive learning objective will be formulated to capture driving semantics. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to unifying perception and prediction tasks with interpretability as a core component. The combination of multi-task attention mechanisms with explainability layers and contrastive learning for driving semantics represents a fresh integration of existing techniques. However, each individual component (transformers for perception, attention-based explainability, contrastive learning) has precedents in the literature. The innovation lies more in their thoughtful combination and application to the autonomous driving domain rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic approaches."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and contrastive learning are established techniques with available implementations. The nuScenes dataset provides appropriate data for training and evaluation. However, there are moderate challenges: (1) training a unified model for both perception and prediction may require significant computational resources, (2) creating effective explainability layers that genuinely improve human understanding is non-trivial, and (3) validating interpretability through user studies adds complexity to the evaluation process. These challenges are surmountable but require careful planning and execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a significant problem in autonomous driving: the inefficiency and error propagation in modular perception-prediction pipelines, as well as the lack of interpretability in current systems. If successful, the unified approach could lead to more efficient, accurate, and trustworthy autonomous vehicles - addressing both technical performance and human factors aspects of self-driving technology. The focus on interpretability is particularly timely given increasing regulatory attention to AI transparency. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the industry has heavily invested in modular pipelines, which may create adoption barriers, but the potential impact on both academic research and industry practice is substantial."
