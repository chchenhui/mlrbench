        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on integration strategies and intermediate representations for autonomous driving by proposing a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph (HSTG) that unifies perception and prediction. The proposal follows through on all aspects mentioned in the research idea, including the hierarchical graph structure, integration of static and dynamic elements, temporal modeling via TCNs, and self-supervised contrastive learning. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing key challenges identified, such as integration of static and dynamic elements, and references relevant works like HDGT and VAD. The methodology section thoroughly explains how the proposed approach incorporates elements from the cited literature while extending them in novel ways."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, with mathematical formulations for the graph construction, message passing, temporal modeling, and loss functions. The experimental design is comprehensive, with specific metrics, datasets, and baselines identified. The timeline provides a clear roadmap for implementation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for feedback between perception and prediction sub-modules could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical details about the edge construction process could be elaborated further, and (3) the proposal could more clearly explain how the system handles occlusions and sensor failures."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by introducing a unified hierarchical spatiotemporal graph representation that integrates static infrastructure and dynamic agents in a shared geometric frame. While individual components like graph neural networks, temporal convolution, and contrastive learning have been explored in prior work (e.g., HDGT, VAD, UniScene), the proposal's novelty lies in their integration and application to joint perception-prediction tasks. The self-supervised contrastive pre-training approach for graph-based scene representation is relatively fresh. However, the core technical components (GAT, TCN, contrastive learning) are established methods rather than groundbreaking innovations. The proposal extends existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms, which limits its novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established graph neural network techniques, with clear mathematical formulations for spatial message passing, temporal modeling, and contrastive learning. The experimental design includes appropriate benchmarks, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The implementation details are specific and realistic. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to assess the contribution of different components. The integration of multiple sensor modalities is handled systematically. However, there are some minor concerns: (1) the proposal could provide more theoretical justification for why the specific graph structure would lead to better performance, and (2) the computational complexity analysis could be more thorough, especially for real-time applications."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The data sources (nuScenes, Waymo, Argoverse 2) are publicly available, and the hardware requirements (8Ã— NVIDIA A100 GPUs) are substantial but accessible in research settings. The 12-month timeline is reasonable for the scope of work. The implementation details are specific enough to be actionable. However, there are feasibility concerns: (1) real-time performance at 15+ FPS on commodity hardware may be challenging given the computational complexity of processing large graphs with multiple GNN layers, (2) the integration of multiple sensor modalities and task heads increases implementation complexity, and (3) the self-supervised pre-training approach may require significant computational resources and hyperparameter tuning to be effective."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in autonomous driving: the integration of perception and prediction systems to reduce error propagation and improve performance in complex scenarios. If successful, the unified HSTG representation could significantly advance the field by: (1) improving detection and prediction accuracy in challenging scenarios, (2) reducing labeled data requirements through self-supervised learning, (3) enhancing safety through explicit modeling of interactions, and (4) providing a more interpretable intermediate representation. The expected improvements (3-5% in detection mAP, 10-15% in trajectory prediction) would be meaningful advances. The broader impacts section convincingly argues for applications in safety, interpretability, generalization, and industry adoption. The proposal aligns well with the workshop's goal of promoting real-world impact in self-driving technology."
