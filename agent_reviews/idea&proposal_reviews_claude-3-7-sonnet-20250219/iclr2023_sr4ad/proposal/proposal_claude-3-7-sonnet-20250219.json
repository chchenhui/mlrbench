        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on representation learning and integration strategies for autonomous driving by proposing a hierarchical spatiotemporal graph framework that unifies perception, prediction, and planning. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the core concepts from the original idea, including the hierarchical structure, dynamic graph neural networks, temporal modeling via TCNs, and self-supervised contrastive learning. It also effectively builds upon the literature review, referencing relevant works like UniScene for occupancy-based representations, VAD for vectorized approaches, and various graph-based methods (HDGT, STGAT, Social-STGCNN) while addressing the key challenges identified in the review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes computational efficiency challenges, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed how its approach mitigates these concerns beyond mentioning distributed training on high-end hardware."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The hierarchical graph structure is precisely defined with mathematical formulations, and the DGNN architecture is explained in detail with appropriate equations. The multi-modal data integration, joint task learning, and self-supervised contrastive learning components are all well-described with sufficient technical depth. The experimental design section provides comprehensive information about datasets, evaluation metrics, baselines, and implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the interaction between the three hierarchical levels could be more explicitly defined, particularly how information flows between them; (2) some of the mathematical notations are introduced without full explanation (e.g., the normalization constant c_ij in the graph convolutional layers); and (3) the proposal could more clearly articulate how the approach handles the transition from perception to planning, which is mentioned as a goal but not fully elaborated in the methodology."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of several existing concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. Its primary innovation lies in the hierarchical organization of the spatiotemporal graph that explicitly models both static infrastructure and dynamic agents within a unified representation, addressing a gap identified in the literature review. The cross-hierarchy attention mechanism and the dynamic edge update module also represent notable contributions. However, many of the core components build directly on existing work: graph neural networks for scene representation, temporal convolutional networks for sequence modeling, and contrastive learning for self-supervision are all established techniques. The joint task learning approach, while comprehensive, follows similar principles to other multi-task learning frameworks. The proposal acknowledges its relationship to prior work and positions itself as an integration and extension rather than a revolutionary approach, which is appropriate but limits its novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The mathematical formulations for the graph structure, neural network architecture, and learning objectives are well-defined and theoretically sound. The hierarchical graph representation is well-justified as a means to capture both static and dynamic elements of driving scenes, and the DGNN architecture appropriately leverages established techniques in graph neural networks and temporal modeling. The multi-task learning framework with task-specific loss functions is well-designed, and the self-supervised contrastive learning approach is grounded in recent advances in representation learning. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, metrics, and baselines. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the proposal does not fully address potential issues with graph scalability in dense urban environments; (2) there is limited discussion of how the approach handles uncertainty in predictions; and (3) while the loss functions are well-defined, there is no discussion of how the task weighting coefficients (Î»_i) are determined, which could significantly impact performance."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a technically ambitious approach that, while theoretically sound, faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the authors specify concrete datasets (nuScenes, Waymo, Argoverse) that contain the necessary data types, and the experimental design includes detailed implementation specifications. The hierarchical graph structure and neural network architecture are well-defined mathematically, suggesting they could be implemented with existing deep learning frameworks. However, several factors limit feasibility: (1) The computational requirements are substantial, requiring 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, which may limit reproducibility; (2) The integration of multiple sensor modalities into a unified graph representation is complex and may encounter practical alignment issues not fully addressed in the methodology; (3) The proposal aims to jointly optimize multiple tasks (detection, tracking, flow estimation, trajectory prediction) which historically has been challenging due to conflicting gradients and different convergence rates; (4) The dynamic graph structure with evolving edge weights adds implementation complexity; and (5) The 50M parameter model size, combined with the need for processing graph structures over time, may present real-time inference challenges for autonomous driving applications, where latency is critical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving: the integration of fragmented perception, prediction, and planning systems. Its significance lies in several key contributions: (1) It offers a unified representation that could reduce error propagation between traditionally separate modules; (2) The explicit modeling of interactions between static infrastructure and dynamic agents could lead to more contextually aware and safer driving decisions; (3) The hierarchical structure provides interpretability, which is crucial for safety-critical applications; (4) The self-supervised learning component could reduce dependency on expensive labeled data; and (5) The approach could influence the architectural design of future autonomous driving systems. The expected improvements (10-15% reduction in trajectory prediction error, 5-8% improvement in detection metrics) would represent meaningful advances in the field. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the proposal does not fully address how this representation would integrate with downstream planning and control systems, and the real-world impact would depend on whether the computational requirements could be met in production vehicles."
