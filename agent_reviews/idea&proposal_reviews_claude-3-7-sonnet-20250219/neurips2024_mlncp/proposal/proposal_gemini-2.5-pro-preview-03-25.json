        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on exploring non-traditional computing paradigms to overcome digital computing limitations, specifically targeting analog hardware co-design with DEQs. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the hybrid analog-digital framework, physics-aware differentiable proxy for training, and expected energy/time efficiency gains. It thoroughly integrates insights from the literature review, citing all provided references and building upon concepts like Physics-Aware Training (Wright et al.), hybrid gradient computation (Nest & Ernoult), and addressing the challenges of analog deep learning identified by Datar & Saha. The proposal also acknowledges the key challenges mentioned in the literature review, such as hardware imperfections, scalability issues, and energy efficiency considerations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, problem statement, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical concepts are explained thoroughly with appropriate mathematical formulations and concrete examples. The hybrid analog-digital architecture is described with sufficient detail to understand how it would work, and the physics-informed differentiable proxy is clearly explained. The training algorithm section provides the mathematical foundation for the approach. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mapping between the mathematical DEQ formulation and specific analog circuit implementations could be more concrete, (2) some technical details about the proxy model calibration process could be elaborated, and (3) the experimental design section could provide more specific details about the simulation environment and implementation tools."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly original approach by combining DEQs with analog hardware in a way that leverages the natural dynamics of physical systems to compute fixed points. While DEQs, physics-informed machine learning, and analog computing have been explored separately, their integration in this specific manner is novel. The physics-informed differentiable proxy for training DEQs on analog hardware represents a fresh perspective that extends beyond existing work. The proposal innovatively adapts implicit differentiation techniques to work through a physics-informed proxy that models hardware imperfections. However, it does build upon existing concepts like Physics-Aware Training and equilibrium propagation rather than introducing entirely new paradigms, which is why it doesn't receive a perfect score. Nevertheless, the specific application to DEQs and the proposed training methodology represent significant innovations in the field of hardware-algorithm co-design."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in established theoretical principles. The mathematical formulation of DEQs and the implicit differentiation approach are correctly presented. The physics-informed training methodology builds logically on existing work in the field. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The proposal assumes that analog circuits can be designed to have equilibrium states that correspond to DEQ fixed points, but doesn't provide detailed analysis of when this correspondence might break down or be difficult to achieve; (2) The convergence properties of the proposed hybrid system aren't thoroughly analyzed - there's an assumption that the physical system will reliably converge to the desired fixed point; (3) While noise and imperfections are acknowledged, the mathematical treatment of how these affect the fixed-point computation could be more rigorous. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and the methodology is well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially feasible research direction. The simulation-based approach is realistic and appropriate given the complexity of fabricating custom analog hardware. The use of circuit simulation tools and numerical models to develop and test the framework is practical. However, several significant challenges affect the feasibility: (1) Designing analog circuits that accurately implement the desired DEQ dynamics while maintaining stability and convergence properties is complex; (2) Creating an accurate differentiable proxy that faithfully captures the behavior of analog hardware, including its non-idealities, is difficult and may require extensive calibration; (3) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address how to handle the gap between simulation and real hardware implementation; (4) The computational resources required for simulating both the proxy model and the analog hardware might be substantial. While the research objectives are achievable in principle, the complexity of the proposed system and the challenges in accurately modeling analog hardware behavior make this a moderately difficult project to implement successfully."
