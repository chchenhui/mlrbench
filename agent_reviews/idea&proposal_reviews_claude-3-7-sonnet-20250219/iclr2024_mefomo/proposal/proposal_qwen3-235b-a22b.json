    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding foundation models, particularly in the areas of pre-training data influence and emergent capabilities. The methodology clearly builds upon the research idea of probing data influence through representation perturbation, and incorporates insights from all four papers mentioned in the literature review. For instance, it references Du et al. (2024) when discussing emergence thresholds and loss dynamics, and builds on Wei et al. (2022) when examining chain-of-thought reasoning. The proposal also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as identifying critical data subsets and developing representation perturbation techniques. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions causal mediation analysis as a challenge, the proposal confidently presents a causal mediation framework without fully acknowledging its complexity."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the data clustering approach, representation perturbation framework, evaluation metrics, and experimental design. Mathematical formulations are precisely defined with appropriate notation and context. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) The connection between the DBSCAN clustering and the task-specific clustering could be more explicitly explained; (2) The validation process for clusters could be more detailed; and (3) Some technical terms like 'attention head specialization' and 'causal tracing' are mentioned without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these concepts. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible but has minor areas that could be further refined for complete clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to understanding the relationship between pre-training data and emergent capabilities in foundation models. While representation analysis and perturbation techniques have been explored in prior work, this proposal innovatively combines semantic clustering, directional perturbation, and causal mediation analysis to specifically target the influence of data subsets on emergent abilities. The cluster-specific adversarial injection method is particularly original, offering a new way to causally link data characteristics to model capabilities. The proposal also introduces a novel framework for quantifying the impact of perturbations through both downstream task performance and representation analysis metrics. While it builds upon existing techniques like DBSCAN clustering and attention head analysis, the integration of these methods into a cohesive framework for probing data influence represents a significant advancement over current approaches in the literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The mathematical formulations for representation perturbation and cluster analysis are well-defined and technically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate control groups and ablation studies to isolate the effects of specific interventions. However, there are some areas where the soundness could be improved: (1) The causal claims made through the perturbation framework may be overstated, as establishing true causality in complex neural networks remains challenging; (2) The proposal assumes that semantic clusters in the representation space directly correspond to data types in the pre-training corpus, which may not always hold; (3) The expected 20% reduction in GSM8K accuracy from perturbing algebraic clusters seems speculative without preliminary evidence. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is methodologically sound, with well-justified techniques and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, it uses existing models (LLaMA-7B, T5-3B) and established evaluation benchmarks (GSM8K, BIG-Bench). The clustering and perturbation techniques build on known methods like DBSCAN and gradient-based interventions. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The computational resources required for extracting and analyzing layer-specific representations across large pre-training corpora could be substantial; (2) The manual annotation of 1% of clusters for semantic coherence may be labor-intensive and subjective; (3) The proposal doesn't address the challenge of isolating the effects of specific data clusters when multiple clusters may contribute to a capability; (4) The timeline and resource allocation are not specified, making it difficult to assess whether the ambitious scope is achievable within reasonable constraints. While the core ideas are implementable, the comprehensive nature of the proposed analysis may require significant refinement or scope reduction to be fully feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in our understanding of foundation models and has the potential for substantial impact. By establishing causal links between pre-training data and emergent capabilities, this research could significantly advance both theoretical understanding and practical applications. The expected outcomes include quantitative evidence linking data clusters to capabilities, validation of emergence thresholds, and practical tools for representation analysis. These contributions would directly benefit the research community's understanding of how foundation models develop emergent abilities. The practical implications are also significant: the proposed curation guidelines could lead to more efficient pre-training (potentially reducing computational costs by 30%) and enable targeted bias mitigation without full retraining. These outcomes align well with the workshop's goals of developing a rigorous characterization of foundation models and addressing safety concerns. While the proposal may not completely solve the mystery of emergent capabilities, it offers a substantial step forward in connecting pre-training data to model behavior."
