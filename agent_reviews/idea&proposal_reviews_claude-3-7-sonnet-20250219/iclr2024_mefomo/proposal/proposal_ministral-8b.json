        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding foundation models, particularly in the pre-training aspect and emergent capabilities. The methodology clearly builds upon the initial idea of investigating pre-training data influence through representation perturbation. The proposal incorporates all key references from the literature review and expands on them appropriately. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all consistent with the task's emphasis on understanding how specific data subsets contribute to emergent abilities in foundation models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The introduction effectively establishes the context and significance of the research. The methodology section provides a detailed description of the proposed approach, including data collection, pre-training, clustering, representation perturbation, and evaluation. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, particularly regarding the specific techniques for representation perturbation and the statistical analysis methods. Additionally, while the experimental design is well-described, more concrete examples of the types of perturbations to be applied would enhance clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to understanding the influence of pre-training data on emergent abilities in foundation models. The idea of selectively perturbing representation components associated with specific data clusters to quantify their impact on downstream tasks is innovative and not extensively explored in the current literature. However, the approach builds upon existing techniques in representation engineering and causal mediation analysis rather than introducing entirely new methodologies. While the combination of these techniques for the specific purpose of understanding data influence is novel, the individual components draw from established methods. The proposal could benefit from more explicit differentiation from prior work in representation analysis."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded. It builds upon established theoretical foundations in representation learning and causal analysis. The methodology is logical and follows a clear progression from data collection to evaluation. The experimental design includes appropriate controls, randomization, and replication to ensure robustness. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened. For instance, the proposal mentions using clustering techniques to identify data subsets but does not fully address potential challenges in clustering high-dimensional text data. Additionally, while the proposal mentions statistical analysis, it could provide more detail on how causal relationships will be established between data subsets and emergent abilities. The connection between representation perturbation and actual data influence could be more rigorously justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but with several significant challenges. Pre-training foundation models requires substantial computational resources, which may be a limiting factor. The process of identifying and perturbing specific representation components associated with data clusters is technically complex and may require iterative refinement. The evaluation of emergent abilities across multiple tasks adds another layer of complexity. While the individual components of the methodology (pre-training, clustering, perturbation, evaluation) are feasible, integrating them into a cohesive pipeline presents challenges. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could provide more detail on how they will be addressed. Additionally, the timeline for completing such an extensive study is not specified, which raises questions about the practical implementation of the research plan."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant question in the field of foundation models: how specific pre-training data subsets influence emergent abilities. Understanding this relationship has important implications for efficient training, capability development, and risk mitigation. The expected outcomes, including the identification of critical data subsets and the development of representation perturbation techniques, could significantly advance our understanding of foundation models and inform more efficient training strategies. The practical guidelines for data curation that would result from this research could have immediate applications in the development of more capable and aligned models. The significance is further enhanced by the growing importance of foundation models in various domains and the need to understand and control their behaviors."
