        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on adaptation of foundation models. It directly addresses the 'Efficient methods' subtopic under Adaptation, which questions whether we need scale during fine-tuning and how fine-tuning can be made more efficient. The proposal specifically tackles the observation that 'fine-tuning often modifies a small subspace of the model parameters' and aims to identify this subspace systematically. The idea also touches on sustainability and accessibility concerns mentioned in the workshop description, particularly regarding the democratization of FM access and reducing computational requirements."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, approach, and evaluation plan. The authors explain their two-step process for identifying important parameter subspaces using Fisher information and activation patterns. The methodology is specified with concrete benchmarking plans against established methods like LoRA across diverse tasks and architectures. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how exactly the Fisher information will be computed efficiently at scale and how the activation magnitude and diversity metrics will be precisely defined and measured. These details would need further elaboration in a full proposal, but the overall concept is presented clearly."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers a fresh approach to parameter-efficient fine-tuning by combining second-order optimization information with activation patterns from pretraining. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods exist (LoRA, adapters, etc.), the proposed approach is novel in its principled, theory-informed method for identifying which parameters matter most for specific tasks. The integration of Fisher information with activation patterns from pretraining represents an innovative combination of techniques. However, both Fisher information matrices and activation-based pruning have been explored separately in prior work, so the novelty lies more in the combination and application rather than introducing entirely new concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The approach faces some significant implementation challenges. Computing Fisher information matrices for large foundation models is computationally expensive, potentially offsetting some of the efficiency gains the method aims to achieve. The proposal doesn't fully address how this computation would be made tractable for very large models. Additionally, identifying the optimal intersection of task-sensitive and representation-critical parameters may require considerable experimentation to determine appropriate thresholds and weighting schemes. The benchmarking plan is reasonable, but the computational resources required for comprehensive evaluation across multiple architectures and tasks could be substantial. While the core idea is implementable, these practical challenges reduce its immediate feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in the deployment and democratization of foundation models. If successful, it would provide both practical benefits (reduced computational costs, lower energy consumption, broader accessibility) and theoretical insights into how foundation models balance general representations with task-specific adaptations. The approach could significantly impact how foundation models are fine-tuned in resource-constrained environments, potentially enabling edge deployment and reducing barriers to entry for researchers with limited computational resources. The theoretical contributions regarding which parameters matter for specific tasks would advance our understanding of representation learning in large models. The environmental impact through reduced energy consumption also adds to its significance."
