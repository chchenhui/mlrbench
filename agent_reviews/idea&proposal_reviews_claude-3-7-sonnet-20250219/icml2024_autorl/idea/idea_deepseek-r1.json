        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The HyperPrompt idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing the core challenge of making RL more robust and accessible through automation. It directly tackles the problem of hyperparameter tuning, which is explicitly mentioned in the task as one of the 'brittle' aspects of RL. The proposal specifically combines LLMs with meta-learning for RL hyperparameter optimization, which fits perfectly within multiple focus areas listed in the task: 'LLMs for reinforcement learning', 'Meta-reinforcement learning', and 'Hyperparameter importance for RL algorithms'. The idea also addresses the task's concern about RL's brittleness to 'seemingly mundane design choices' by automating these decisions."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, approach, and expected outcomes. The proposal defines a specific goal (dynamic hyperparameter adaptation), a concrete methodology (using LLMs as meta-learners), and a validation strategy (testing on procedurally generated benchmarks). The technical approach is explained in sufficient detail, describing how trajectories and metrics will be encoded into prompts and how the system will operate during deployment. The only minor ambiguities are in the specifics of how the meta-training framework will be structured and how exactly the LLM outputs will be translated into hyperparameter adjustments, which would benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by combining LLMs with meta-reinforcement learning for dynamic hyperparameter adaptation. While both LLMs for RL and hyperparameter optimization exist separately, the integration of these approaches for real-time adaptation during training represents a novel direction. The proposal explicitly contrasts itself with existing approaches like OptFormer, highlighting its innovation in real-time adaptability versus offline optimization. The framing of hyperparameter adjustment as a partially observable meta-policy is particularly innovative. The approach isn't completely unprecedented, as it builds upon existing work in meta-learning and LLMs, but it combines these elements in a fresh way that addresses a significant gap in current AutoRL research."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology, though it presents moderate implementation challenges. The core components—LLMs, meta-learning frameworks, and RL environments—are all well-established. The proposal wisely selects procedurally generated benchmarks like NetHack and Procgen, which are appropriate for testing generalization capabilities. However, there are practical challenges: (1) creating effective encodings of RL trajectories and metrics for LLM consumption may require significant engineering, (2) the computational resources needed to finetune LLMs on diverse RL tasks could be substantial, and (3) ensuring that the LLM can make meaningful hyperparameter recommendations in real-time without introducing excessive latency will require careful system design. These challenges are surmountable but will require considerable effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical pain point in RL application—the difficulty of hyperparameter tuning—which directly impacts the field's accessibility and practical utility. If successful, the approach could significantly reduce the expertise barrier for applying RL to novel problems, democratizing access to RL technology as explicitly mentioned in the proposal. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications across domains where RL could be valuable but is currently limited by tuning challenges. The work also contributes to the theoretical understanding of meta-learning in RL contexts. While the significance is high, it stops short of the highest score because the focus is on improving an existing paradigm rather than introducing a fundamentally new approach to RL, and the impact, while broad, may be incremental in some application areas."
