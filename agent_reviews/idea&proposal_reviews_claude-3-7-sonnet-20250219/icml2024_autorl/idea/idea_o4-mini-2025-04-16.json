    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The HyperG proposal is extremely well-aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Hyperparameter agnostic RL algorithms' focus area mentioned in the task, and also touches on 'AutoML for reinforcement learning' by automating the hyperparameter selection process. The idea aims to solve the brittleness of RL algorithms to design choices, which is explicitly mentioned as a challenge in the task description. The meta-learning approach also aligns with the 'Meta-reinforcement learning' focus area. The only minor reason it's not a perfect 10 is that it doesn't explicitly address some other areas mentioned in the task like LLMs or fairness/interpretability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The HyperG idea is presented with strong clarity. The problem statement is well-defined (costly hyperparameter tuning), and the solution approach is clearly articulated with a specific methodology (mapping environment embeddings to hyperparameters via a meta-learning loop). The training process is explained step-by-step, and the evaluation approach is mentioned. The only minor ambiguities are around the exact nature of the environment embeddings (what specific metrics constitute 'reward sparsity metrics'?) and how the meta-learning loop is structured in detail. These are implementation details that would likely be clarified in a full paper but don't significantly detract from understanding the core idea."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "HyperG presents a novel approach to hyperparameter optimization in RL by framing it as a meta-learning problem. While hyperparameter optimization itself is not new, and meta-learning for RL has been explored before, the specific combination of using a neural generator to map environment characteristics directly to hyperparameters in a one-shot manner is innovative. The approach differs from traditional methods like grid search or Bayesian optimization. However, it builds upon existing meta-learning concepts rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, and similar approaches have been explored in other domains of machine learning, which is why it scores a 7 rather than higher."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The HyperG approach is feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Creating meaningful environment embeddings that capture the essential characteristics needed for hyperparameter prediction is non-trivial. The meta-learning loop requires training across a diverse task distribution, which demands significant computational resources. There are also questions about how well the approach would generalize to truly novel environments outside the training distribution. The validation on MuJoCo and Atari is promising but these are well-studied benchmarks. The approach seems technically implementable with current technology, but would require considerable engineering effort and computational resources to realize effectively."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "HyperG addresses a significant pain point in reinforcement learning: the need for expert-driven hyperparameter tuning. If successful, it could substantially lower the barrier to entry for applying RL to new problems, potentially expanding the use of RL in real-world applications. The democratization aspect is particularly important as it aligns with making AI more accessible. The impact on reproducibility in RL research would also be valuable. The approach doesn't fundamentally change what RL can do, but rather makes existing capabilities more accessible and reliable, which is why it scores an 8 rather than higher. Nevertheless, this is a meaningful contribution that could have broad impact across the field."
