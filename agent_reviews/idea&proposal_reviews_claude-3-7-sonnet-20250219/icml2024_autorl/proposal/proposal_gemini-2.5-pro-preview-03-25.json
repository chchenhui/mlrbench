    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the AutoRL focus area by proposing an LLM-based approach for dynamic hyperparameter adaptation in RL. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly addressing hyperparameter brittleness (Eimer et al., 2023), dynamic hyperparameter landscapes (Mohan et al., 2023), and evaluation frameworks (ARLBench). The methodology clearly builds upon the core idea of using LLMs as meta-controllers for hyperparameter adaptation, and properly cites all relevant literature. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions OptFormer as inspiration, it could have more explicitly connected to the LLM-for-AutoML aspects mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally well-structured and clearly articulated. The research problem, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all precisely defined with logical flow. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations and clear descriptions of the prompt engineering process, meta-training procedure, and evaluation framework. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-specified environments, baselines, and metrics. The proposal effectively communicates complex ideas about the intersection of LLMs and RL in an accessible manner. The only minor improvement could be a more concise presentation of some sections, as certain explanations are somewhat verbose."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The HyperPrompt framework presents a novel approach to dynamic hyperparameter adaptation in RL by leveraging LLMs as meta-controllers. While both AutoRL and LLMs for RL have been explored separately, their integration for real-time hyperparameter adaptation represents a significant innovation. The proposal extends beyond existing work like OptFormer by focusing on dynamic, online adaptation rather than static optimization. The prompt engineering approach for encoding RL trajectories and performance metrics is creative and original. The framework's ability to learn adaptation strategies across diverse environments is innovative. The score is not higher only because the core idea builds upon existing meta-learning concepts, though it applies them in a novel context."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is well-grounded in established research. The methodology is comprehensive, with clear formulations of the meta-learning framework and detailed descriptions of the training and evaluation procedures. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, diverse environments, and relevant metrics. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and offers mitigation strategies. The mathematical formulation of the meta-learning problem is sound. The only limitations are: (1) the proposal could provide more details on how the LLM will be efficiently finetuned for this specific task, and (2) the approach for generating high-quality supervision signals for LLM training could be more thoroughly developed, as this represents a significant technical challenge."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined steps and implementation details. The methodology leverages existing technologies (LLMs, RL algorithms, benchmarks) in a novel combination. The researchers acknowledge key challenges and provide reasonable mitigation strategies. However, several practical challenges affect the feasibility score: (1) The computational resources required for meta-training across diverse environments could be substantial; (2) Creating high-quality supervision signals for LLM training is non-trivial; (3) The latency of LLM inference during RL training could be problematic for real-time adaptation; (4) The prompt engineering process may require extensive experimentation to encode RL state effectively. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they represent significant hurdles that could impact the project's success."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning - the brittleness of algorithms to hyperparameter settings - which is a significant barrier to broader RL adoption. If successful, HyperPrompt could substantially reduce the expertise and computational resources required for effective RL deployment, democratizing access to state-of-the-art RL techniques. The approach bridges multiple research communities (RL, LLMs, AutoML, Meta-Learning) in a novel way that directly addresses the workshop's goals. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications across domains where RL is being applied. The framework could also provide valuable insights into the relationship between hyperparameter dynamics and learning progress. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of sample-efficient and robust RL methods in real-world applications."
