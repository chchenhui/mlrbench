        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on explainability and interpretability of AI models in scientific contexts, particularly for differential equations. The three-component approach (symbolic-neural hybrid, attention mechanisms, and counterfactual explanations) faithfully implements the research idea. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like LNO [1], RiemannONets [2], and DisentangO [3] while addressing the identified challenges, especially the balance between accuracy and interpretability. The methodology is comprehensive and well-structured, covering all aspects mentioned in the original idea with appropriate technical depth."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-articulated and logically structured. The introduction clearly establishes the context and motivation, while the methodology section provides detailed explanations of each component with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are thoroughly described. However, there are a few minor areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the symbolic and neural components during training could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical details about the attention mechanism implementation within the neural operator architecture could be elaborated, and (3) the relationship between the three interpretability components could be more clearly articulated in terms of how they complement each other in practice."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by integrating multiple interpretability approaches specifically for neural operators solving differential equations. While individual components draw from existing techniques (symbolic regression, attention mechanisms, counterfactual analysis), their combination and adaptation to the neural operator context represents a fresh perspective. The symbolic-neural decomposition approach is particularly innovative in the context of operator learning. However, the proposal doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithmic innovations; rather, it creatively combines and adapts existing methods to address the interpretability challenge in a specific domain. The attention-based attribution and counterfactual components, while valuable, follow relatively established approaches in the broader XAI literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of the symbolic-neural hybrid model is well-defined, with clear loss functions and training objectives. The attention mechanisms are grounded in established transformer literature, and the counterfactual approach is methodologically sound. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, with appropriate metrics for both predictive accuracy and interpretability quality. The benchmark problems (Burgers', Heat, Navier-Stokes) are well-chosen and representative. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations and trade-offs, showing awareness of technical challenges. One minor weakness is that the theoretical guarantees for the symbolic component's expressivity and the convergence properties of the hybrid approach could be more thoroughly addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The individual components (neural operators, symbolic regression, attention mechanisms) have established implementations, making their integration plausible. The benchmark problems are standard and have available solvers for generating training data. However, several aspects may require considerable effort: (1) jointly training the symbolic and neural components while maintaining interpretability could be challenging, (2) the computational resources needed for training on complex PDEs like Navier-Stokes might be substantial, (3) the qualitative evaluation by domain experts adds logistical complexity, and (4) balancing the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy may require extensive hyperparameter tuning. The timeline and resource requirements are not explicitly addressed, which would be important for assessing complete feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in Scientific Machine Learning: the lack of interpretability in neural operators for differential equations. This work has clear potential for significant impact across multiple scientific domains that rely on DE modeling, including climate science, fluid dynamics, and biomedical engineering. By enabling scientists to understand and trust AI-generated solutions, it could accelerate the adoption of these powerful tools in scientific workflows. The framework's ability to provide multiple complementary forms of explanation (symbolic, attention-based, counterfactual) enhances its utility for different types of scientific inquiry. The contribution to both the SciML and XAI communities is valuable. While the immediate impact might be strongest in research settings, the long-term implications for scientific discovery and high-stakes applications are substantial."
