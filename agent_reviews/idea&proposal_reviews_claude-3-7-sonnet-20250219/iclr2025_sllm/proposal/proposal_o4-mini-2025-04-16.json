    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the intersection of Mixture of Experts, quantization, hardware efficiency, and inference optimization. The proposal builds upon the identified literature, particularly drawing from works like MiLo, MC-MoE, and MoQa, while addressing the key challenges highlighted in the literature review regarding quantization-induced accuracy degradation and adaptive bit-width allocation. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed Dynamic Mixed-Precision Quantization (DMPQ) framework bridges sparsity-aware algorithms with hardware efficiency, which is a central theme in the task description. The proposal's emphasis on hardware-in-the-loop optimization and co-design of MoE architecture with quantization schemes shows strong consistency with both the research idea and the broader workshop goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations and pseudocode. The experimental design section provides comprehensive details on datasets, baselines, metrics, and evaluation protocols. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for how the RL policy translates state observations into bit-width assignments could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the cost model and the reward function could be further elaborated, and (3) some of the mathematical notation in section 3.1 could be more precisely defined. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to quantizing MoE models by introducing dynamic mixed-precision quantization guided by reinforcement learning. While prior works like MC-MoE have explored mixed-precision quantization for MoEs, this proposal innovates by: (1) formulating the bit-width allocation as an RL problem rather than using static heuristics or linear programming, (2) incorporating hardware-in-the-loop optimization to directly optimize for real-world performance metrics, and (3) co-designing the MoE weights and quantization policy during training. The integration of expert activation frequency, gradient magnitude, and historical accuracy into the state representation for the RL policy is particularly innovative. The proposal builds upon existing literature but offers a fresh perspective and methodology that could significantly advance the field. However, it shares some conceptual similarities with existing approaches like MC-MoE's mixed-precision quantization, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in most aspects. The quantization approach is well-grounded in established techniques, and the RL formulation for bit-width allocation is technically sound. The co-training algorithm for interleaving policy updates and weight fine-tuning is well-justified and addresses potential instability issues. However, there are some areas where the technical soundness could be strengthened: (1) the reward function design includes multiple objectives (accuracy, latency, energy) but doesn't fully address how these potentially competing objectives will be balanced beyond simple weighting coefficients, (2) the proposal doesn't thoroughly discuss potential challenges with RL convergence in this complex optimization landscape, and (3) while hardware-in-the-loop evaluation is mentioned, the details of how the cost model will be calibrated and validated could be more rigorous. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and builds appropriately on established techniques in quantization, MoEs, and reinforcement learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The methodology leverages existing techniques in quantization and reinforcement learning, and the experimental design includes appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics. The risk mitigation section acknowledges potential challenges and offers reasonable alternatives. However, several factors affect the feasibility score: (1) hardware-in-the-loop optimization can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, potentially slowing down the RL policy training, (2) the combinatorial space of bit-width assignments for tens or hundreds of experts is extremely large, which may challenge the RL policy's ability to find optimal solutions efficiently, (3) the co-training approach requires careful balancing to prevent instability, and (4) the development of accurate cost models for diverse hardware platforms is non-trivial. While these challenges are acknowledged and mitigation strategies are proposed, they do represent significant implementation hurdles that could impact the project's success."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in deploying large MoE models on resource-constrained hardware, which has significant implications for accessibility, sustainability, and practical applications of LLMs. The expected outcomes of 2-3Ã— speedup and 40% memory reduction would represent a substantial advancement in efficient MoE deployment. The work bridges multiple research areas (MoEs, quantization, hardware co-design, reinforcement learning) in a way that aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of fostering connections between related fields. The broader impact section convincingly argues for the proposal's significance in terms of accessibility, sustainability, interpretability, and extensibility. The open-source cost modeling toolkit would provide value to the research community beyond the immediate results. While the proposal may not fundamentally transform the field of MoE or quantization, it represents a significant step forward in their practical application and integration, particularly for resource-constrained settings."
