    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the intersection of Mixture of Experts, quantization, and hardware efficiency for inference. The proposal comprehensively covers the key aspects mentioned in the task description, including sparsity-based techniques, hardware innovations, and quantization for MoEs. The research objectives match the original idea of developing a dynamic mixed-precision quantization framework where experts are quantized to variable bit-widths based on activation patterns. The methodology incorporates the hardware-in-the-loop optimization and reinforcement learning policy mentioned in the idea. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by addressing identified challenges such as quantization-induced accuracy degradation, adaptive bit-width allocation, and balancing compression with performance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The introduction effectively establishes the context and motivation for the research. The methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the research design, data collection process, and algorithmic steps. The mathematical formulation adds rigor to the proposal by formalizing the optimization problem. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact reinforcement learning algorithm to be used for the bit-width selection policy could be more specifically defined, (2) the hardware platforms targeted for evaluation could be more explicitly stated, and (3) some technical details about how the system co-design will be implemented during training could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a dynamic mixed-precision quantization framework specifically designed for MoE models. While quantization for MoEs has been explored in the literature (as seen in MiLo, MC-MoE, MoQa, and MoQE), this proposal offers a fresh perspective by combining several innovative elements: (1) the use of reinforcement learning for bit-width selection, (2) hardware-in-the-loop optimization to ensure practical efficiency gains, and (3) system co-design that integrates the quantization scheme during training. The approach of quantizing experts based on their activation frequency and contribution to model outputs is a novel extension of existing work. However, the proposal shares some similarities with MC-MoE's Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization mentioned in the literature review, which also formulates adaptive bit-width allocation, though through different technical means (Linear Programming vs. RL)."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulation of the cost function provides a solid theoretical basis for the bit-width selection policy, incorporating accuracy loss, inference speed, and energy costs with appropriate weighting factors. The three-stage methodology (literature review, algorithm development, implementation and evaluation) follows a logical progression. The hardware-in-the-loop optimization approach is well-justified for ensuring real-world performance gains. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive, covering inference speed, memory usage, accuracy, and energy costs. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined and technically sound. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further elaboration: (1) the specific techniques for measuring expert contribution to model outputs, (2) how the system will handle potential instability during training with varying precision, and (3) more detailed analysis of potential trade-offs between the different components of the cost function."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it will require moderate refinement and optimization. The core components—MoE architectures, quantization techniques, and reinforcement learning—are well-established in the literature. The hardware-in-the-loop optimization is more challenging but achievable with appropriate hardware simulation tools. The expected outcomes (2-3x faster inference, 40% lower memory usage with <1% accuracy drop) are ambitious but not unrealistic based on results reported in the literature review. However, several implementation challenges may arise: (1) the computational cost of training the RL policy with hardware in the loop could be substantial, (2) ensuring consistent performance across different hardware platforms may require significant engineering effort, and (3) the co-design of MoE architecture and quantization scheme during training might introduce training instabilities that need careful management. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential implementation challenges and mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in deploying large MoE models on resource-constrained hardware, which is highly relevant to both academic research and industry applications. The potential impact is substantial: (1) enabling more efficient deployment of MoE models could democratize access to advanced AI capabilities, (2) reducing the computational and energy requirements aligns with environmental sustainability goals, (3) the framework could establish new methodologies for hardware-aware AI system design, and (4) the insights gained could inform future research at the intersection of sparsity, quantization, and hardware efficiency. The expected outcomes of 2-3x faster inference and 40% lower memory usage would represent a significant advancement over current approaches. The proposal also contributes to the broader goal of integrating sparsity-aware algorithms with hardware efficiency, as emphasized in the task description. The work could influence both academic research directions and industry practices in deploying large AI models."
