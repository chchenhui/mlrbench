    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on sparsity in deep learning, specifically targeting the intersection of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures and quantization techniques for hardware-efficient inference. The proposal builds upon the research idea of dynamic mixed-precision quantization for MoEs, elaborating it into a comprehensive framework that considers expert activation patterns, importance metrics, and hardware constraints. The literature review is thoroughly integrated throughout the proposal, with appropriate citations to relevant works like MiLo [1], MC-MoE [2], MoQa [3], and MoQE [4]. The proposal acknowledges the limitations of existing approaches while positioning its contribution as a novel hardware-aware dynamic quantization framework that bridges the gap between algorithmic sparsity and hardware efficiency."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. It provides a logical flow from background and problem statement to methodology and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail, including mathematical formulations for quantization and the RL-based optimization framework. The experimental design section outlines baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies comprehensively. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating hardware feedback into the RL loop could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the QAT process and the RL policy training could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical details about how the hardware performance models would be constructed or calibrated are somewhat vague. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to MoE quantization by introducing dynamic, hardware-aware mixed-precision allocation through reinforcement learning. While mixed-precision quantization itself is not new, and several cited works (MC-MoE [2], MoQa [3]) already explore adaptive bit-width allocation for MoEs, this proposal innovates in several ways: (1) the use of RL for bit-width optimization with hardware performance metrics directly in the reward function, (2) the integration of hardware-in-the-loop feedback during optimization, and (3) the co-design of quantization-aware training with the dynamic bit-width allocation policy. The approach bridges algorithmic techniques with hardware considerations in a way that extends beyond existing literature. However, the core techniques (mixed-precision quantization, RL for optimization, QAT) are established methods being applied to a specific problem rather than fundamentally new algorithmic innovations, which limits the novelty score from reaching the highest levels."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness in its approach. The quantization methodology is based on established affine quantization techniques with appropriate mathematical formulations. The RL framework for bit-width allocation is well-defined with clear state and action spaces, policy network structure, and a comprehensive reward function that balances multiple objectives. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The integration of hardware performance feedback into the optimization loop is theoretically sound, though practical implementation challenges are acknowledged. The proposal also shows awareness of potential limitations and includes ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components. The QAT approach builds on established techniques in the field. One minor concern is that the proposal doesn't fully address potential instabilities in the RL training process or how to ensure convergence to optimal bit-width configurations, but overall, the technical foundations are robust and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but with some implementation challenges that could affect its practicality. On the positive side, the approach builds on existing techniques (quantization, RL, QAT) that have established implementations, and the authors propose using available open-source MoE models like Mixtral or OLMoE. The evaluation methodology is realistic and well-defined. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The hardware-in-the-loop optimization could be time-consuming and complex to implement, especially if targeting multiple hardware platforms; (2) Training or fine-tuning large MoE models with QAT requires substantial computational resources; (3) The RL policy training might require extensive hyperparameter tuning to balance the multi-objective reward function effectively; (4) Implementing efficient mixed-precision inference kernels for MoEs could require significant engineering effort, especially for non-standard bit-widths. While these challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, they do increase implementation complexity and resource requirements, potentially limiting the scope of experiments or requiring simplifications to the approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant challenge in deploying large MoE models efficiently, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on sparsity and efficiency in deep learning. If successful, the research could have substantial impact in several ways: (1) Enabling deployment of state-of-the-art MoE models on resource-constrained hardware, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities; (2) Reducing operational costs and environmental impact of large model inference; (3) Advancing the understanding of the interplay between parameter sparsity (through quantization) and activation sparsity (inherent in MoEs); (4) Providing a framework that bridges algorithmic optimization with hardware efficiency considerations. The expected outcomes (2-3x latency reduction, 40% memory reduction with <1% accuracy drop) would represent meaningful improvements over existing approaches. The work could influence both academic research in efficient AI and industry practices in model deployment. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on inference efficiency rather than more transformative aspects of AI research, but within its domain, the potential impact is substantial."
