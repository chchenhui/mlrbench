    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It focuses on synthetic data generation for rare diseases using diffusion models, which directly addresses the workshop's call for 'synthetic data generation' and 'diffusion models' applications in healthcare. The proposal specifically targets rare diseases, which the workshop explicitly mentions as an under-explored challenge area. The idea also incorporates validation procedures and interpretability, which are key topics highlighted in the workshop description. The only minor limitation in alignment is that while the proposal mentions downstream classification tasks, it could have more explicitly addressed how the synthetic data would be actionable in clinical practice beyond research purposes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (data scarcity in rare diseases), the proposed solution (diffusion-based framework with clinical biomarker conditioning), and the evaluation approach (hybrid validation protocol). The technical components are well-defined, including the latent diffusion architecture with learnable clinical embeddings. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly stated. However, some minor ambiguities exist: the specific rare diseases to be targeted aren't specified, the exact implementation details of the 'learnable clinical embeddings' could be more precisely defined, and the balance between privacy preservation and clinical utility could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its application domain and validation approach. While diffusion models themselves are not new, the integration of clinically interpretable biomarkers as conditioning factors represents a fresh approach to medical image generation. The hybrid validation protocol combining automated metrics with structured clinician feedback is also innovative in the context of synthetic medical data evaluation. However, the core technical approach builds upon existing diffusion model architectures rather than proposing fundamentally new generative techniques. The novelty lies more in the application and adaptation to the rare disease context than in the underlying generative methodology itself."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but faces some implementation challenges. Diffusion models are well-established, and the technical components described (latent diffusion architecture, conditioning mechanisms) are implementable with current technology. However, several practical challenges exist: obtaining sufficient initial rare disease data to train the models may be difficult by definition; ensuring clinical biomarkers are accurately represented in the synthetic data requires sophisticated validation; and coordinating structured clinician feedback at scale could be resource-intensive. The proposal would benefit from more details on how these challenges would be addressed, particularly regarding the minimum data requirements needed to bootstrap the generative process for extremely rare conditions."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is very high. Rare diseases collectively affect millions of people worldwide but individually suffer from severe data scarcity that hampers both research and clinical care. By addressing this fundamental limitation, the proposal could enable more equitable AI applications across underrepresented conditions. The potential impact extends beyond just having more data - it could accelerate diagnostic tool development, treatment research, and clinical trial design for conditions that currently receive limited attention. The emphasis on clinical validation also addresses a critical gap in current synthetic data approaches, potentially making the results more trustworthy and adoptable in real clinical settings. The work directly addresses healthcare disparities in AI applications."
