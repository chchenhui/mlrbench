        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on deep generative models for health applications, specifically targeting multimodal diffusion models for healthcare diagnostics. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the hierarchical architecture, modality-specific encoders, shared latent space, and adaptive training strategies. It also builds upon the literature review by referencing and extending works like MedM2G, MedCoDi-M, and DiffMIC. The proposal addresses challenges identified in the literature review such as data scarcity, multimodal integration, missing modalities, and explainability. The focus on rare diseases and underrepresented populations aligns with the workshop's encouragement for work targeting minority data groups."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate mathematical formulations. The architecture components (modality-specific encoders, shared latent space, diffusion process, adaptive training) are well-defined with sufficient technical detail. The experimental design includes clear baselines, metrics, and implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating medical ontologies into attention mechanisms could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the diffusion process and the reconstruction loss could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some of the mathematical notation (e.g., f_\\\\text{att}(h_m)) is introduced without full definition."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The integration of medical ontologies into diffusion model attention mechanisms is highlighted as a first-of-its-kind contribution. The adaptive training framework with modality masking for handling missing clinical data represents a fresh approach to a significant challenge. The hierarchical multimodal fusion strategy with clinical knowledge integration also offers a novel perspective. However, the core techniques build upon existing methods in the literature (diffusion models, cross-modal attention, feature attribution) rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal combines and extends these existing approaches in innovative ways for the healthcare domain, but doesn't present a groundbreaking new paradigm. The novelty lies more in the application and adaptation of these techniques to the specific challenges of multimodal medical diagnostics rather than in developing entirely new methodological foundations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The diffusion process is mathematically well-formulated with clear forward and reverse processes. The loss functions are properly defined, including the classification-free guidance term and reconstruction loss. The integration of clinical knowledge through attention mechanisms is theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and evaluation protocols. The proposal also acknowledges and addresses key challenges in the field, such as missing modalities and interpretability. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) the choice of \\\\lambda=0.1 for balancing the loss terms is stated without explanation, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the model's performance under extreme missing data scenarios are not fully explored, and (3) the statistical properties of the generated synthetic data are not thoroughly analyzed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The data sources (MIMIC-CXR-JPG, ADNI, institutional EHRs) are well-established and accessible. The model architecture builds on existing components (ViT, BioBERT, diffusion models) that have proven implementations. The experimental design with 5-fold cross-validation and standard metrics is practical. However, several aspects may require considerable effort: (1) integrating medical ontologies (e.g., SNOMED-CT) into attention mechanisms will require significant domain expertise and engineering, (2) the computational resources needed for training diffusion models on multiple modalities simultaneously could be substantial, (3) the institutional dataset for congenital heart defects may present data access and privacy challenges, and (4) the explainability components, particularly for multimodal inputs, may be difficult to validate clinically. While these challenges are manageable, they represent non-trivial implementation hurdles that could impact the timeline and scope of the project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses important challenges in healthcare AI with potentially high impact. Improving diagnostic accuracy for rare diseases and underrepresented populations addresses a critical gap in current systems. The ability to maintain performance with missing modalities would significantly enhance clinical utility in real-world settings where complete data is often unavailable. The explainability components could improve clinical trust and adoption. The expected outcomes include concrete metrics (â‰¤5% AUC drop with 30% missing modalities, >0.92 AUROC for Alzheimer's) that would represent meaningful advances. The proposal also aligns with regulatory requirements (FDA guidelines for explainable AI) and addresses ethical considerations (data privacy, bias auditing). The potential for synthetic data generation could help address data scarcity issues more broadly. While the impact is primarily focused on specific clinical domains (Alzheimer's, congenital heart defects) rather than transforming healthcare AI as a whole, the methodological contributions could have wider implications for multimodal medical AI systems."
