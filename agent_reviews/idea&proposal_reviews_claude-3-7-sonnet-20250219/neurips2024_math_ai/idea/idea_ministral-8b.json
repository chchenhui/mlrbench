        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on mathematical reasoning and AI. It directly addresses the guiding theme of machine comprehension of mathematics and potential applications. The proposal covers multiple topics mentioned in the workshop description: comparing human and machine reasoning, developing new capabilities through multi-modal learning, educational applications (especially in resource-limited contexts), and broader applications in software verification and scientific discovery. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address benchmark design for evaluating mathematical reasoning, though it does mention developing evaluation datasets."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact. The five-step methodology provides a concrete roadmap for implementation. The multi-modal approach combining LLMs, CNNs, and symbolic reasoning modules is well-defined. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as how the symbolic reasoning modules will be integrated with neural components, the specific reinforcement learning techniques to be employed, and more details on the evaluation metrics and benchmarks to be developed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea of combining multi-modal learning with mathematical reasoning is innovative and represents a fresh approach to a challenging problem. While multi-modal learning itself is not new, and there have been attempts to enhance mathematical reasoning in AI, the specific combination of text, images, and symbolic representations for mathematical proofs offers a novel perspective. The integration of LLMs with computer vision and symbolic reasoning systems for mathematics specifically is relatively unexplored. However, each individual component (LLMs for text, CNNs for images, symbolic reasoning) has been extensively researched, so the novelty lies primarily in their integration rather than in developing fundamentally new techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces several implementation challenges. While data collection from textbooks and papers is feasible, creating high-quality annotations for mathematical proofs would require significant expertise and resources. The integration of neural and symbolic systems remains a challenging research area with many open questions. Training such a complex multi-modal system would require substantial computational resources. The evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities is also non-trivial, as current benchmarks may not adequately capture the nuances of proof generation and verification. While the individual components (LLMs, CNNs, symbolic systems) exist, their effective integration for mathematical reasoning represents a considerable technical challenge that may require multiple iterations and refinements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The potential impact of this research is substantial. Mathematical reasoning is a fundamental cognitive capability that has numerous applications across domains. Enhancing AI's mathematical reasoning abilities could lead to significant advancements in automated theorem proving, scientific discovery, and educational tools. The educational impact is particularly noteworthy, as it could help address inequalities in access to quality mathematics education. The research also contributes to our understanding of human cognition by modeling complex reasoning processes. If successful, this work could bridge an important gap between symbolic AI approaches and neural network methods, potentially leading to more general reasoning capabilities in AI systems beyond mathematics."
