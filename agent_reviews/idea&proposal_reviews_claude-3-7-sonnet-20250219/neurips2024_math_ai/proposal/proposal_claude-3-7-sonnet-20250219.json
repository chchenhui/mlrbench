    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's guiding theme of assessing LLM mathematical comprehension and potential applications. The AMRAS framework specifically tackles the challenge of creating contamination-resistant, dynamic benchmarks for mathematical reasoning evaluation, which is a central topic in the workshop. The proposal incorporates key elements from the literature review, including concerns about data contamination, the need to evaluate reasoning processes beyond final answers (as in Xia et al., 2024), and adaptive problem generation techniques. The methodology section thoroughly details how the system will implement procedural content generation for mathematical problems with adaptive difficulty adjustment, directly fulfilling the main idea presented in the research idea document."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the significance of the work is thoroughly explained. The system architecture is presented with a helpful diagram, and the mathematical formulations for complexity estimation, reasoning score calculation, and adaptation algorithms are precisely defined. The experimental design is laid out in clear phases with specific goals. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the symbolic mathematics processing for validating reasoning steps could be more specific, (2) some of the weighting coefficients in various formulas are mentioned but their determination process is not fully explained, and (3) the relationship between the problem generator and the evaluation module could be more explicitly defined in terms of data flow and interaction."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach to mathematical reasoning assessment through its adaptive, dynamic framework. While procedural content generation and adaptive testing exist in other contexts, AMRAS uniquely combines these techniques to address the specific challenges of evaluating LLM mathematical reasoning. The system's ability to dynamically adjust problem characteristics based on model performance represents a significant advancement over static benchmarks. The multi-dimensional evaluation that considers not just answer correctness but reasoning quality, strategy appropriateness, and generalization detection is particularly novel. The proposal builds upon existing work (like ReasonEval mentioned in the literature review) but extends it considerably by creating a comprehensive, adaptive system. The approach of using symbolic mathematics processing to verify reasoning steps is innovative in the context of LLM evaluation. However, some elements, such as procedural content generation and adaptive difficulty adjustment, do have precedents in educational technology and gaming, which slightly reduces the overall novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The system architecture is well-conceived, with clear components and interactions. The mathematical formulations for complexity estimation, reasoning evaluation, and adaptation are logically sound and build on established principles. The experimental design follows a systematic approach with appropriate phases for calibration, assessment, and analysis. However, there are some areas where the technical soundness could be strengthened: (1) the validity check algorithm is presented at a high level without sufficient detail on how 'solveSymbolically' would be implemented for diverse problem types, (2) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in automatically generating reference solutions for complex problems, (3) there's limited discussion of how to ensure that procedurally generated problems maintain semantic coherence and natural language quality, and (4) the adaptation engine's learning rate parameter determination is not thoroughly explained. These gaps, while not undermining the overall approach, do raise questions about some implementation details."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, many components build on existing technologies: procedural content generation, symbolic mathematics systems, and LLM evaluation frameworks. The phased experimental approach is realistic and allows for incremental development and testing. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) automatically generating valid, coherent mathematical problems with controlled difficulty is a complex task that may require significant engineering effort, (2) developing a symbolic mathematics system capable of validating diverse reasoning steps across multiple mathematical domains is technically challenging, (3) ensuring that generated problems are truly novel and contamination-resistant would require careful verification, and (4) the computational resources needed for large-scale evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs could be substantial. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively suggest that full implementation of AMRAS as described would require considerable resources and expertise across multiple domains, making it moderately feasible but with significant hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need in AI evaluation and has far-reaching implications. The problem of data contamination in static benchmarks is increasingly undermining our ability to accurately assess LLM capabilities, making this research highly timely and important. By developing a dynamic, adaptive framework for mathematical reasoning assessment, AMRAS would provide a more robust and informative evaluation methodology that could become standard in the field. The potential impacts extend beyond just evaluation to include insights into mathematical cognition, applications in educational technology, and contributions to trustworthy AI development. The proposal directly addresses multiple topics from the workshop description, including measuring mathematical reasoning, comparing human and machine approaches, and educational applications. The expected outcomes—particularly the detailed capability profiles and insights into reasoning processes—would significantly advance our understanding of LLM mathematical comprehension. The open-source nature of the planned system further amplifies its potential impact by enabling widespread adoption and extension by the research community."
