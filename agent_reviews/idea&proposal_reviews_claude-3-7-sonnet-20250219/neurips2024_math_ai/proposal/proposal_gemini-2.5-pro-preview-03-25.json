    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's guiding theme of understanding ML models' comprehension of mathematics by developing ADAPT-MATH, a system that dynamically evaluates mathematical reasoning. The proposal incorporates key concerns from the literature review, such as data contamination (Brown & Green, 2024), the need to evaluate reasoning processes beyond accuracy (Xia et al., 2024), and adaptive testing approaches (White & Black, 2025). It also builds upon procedural content generation techniques mentioned in the literature (Johnson & Williams, 2024; Chen & Lee, 2023). The proposal's focus on creating a contamination-resistant, adaptive assessment framework directly responds to the workshop's topic of 'Measuring mathematical reasoning' in the era of LLMs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. It provides a comprehensive introduction that establishes the context and motivation, followed by detailed research objectives and a thorough methodology section that explains the system architecture, problem representation, procedural generation approach, adaptation mechanism, experimental design, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly delineated. The technical aspects, such as the adaptation mechanism and evaluation metrics, are explained with sufficient detail. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as more concrete examples of how the problem templates would be instantiated and how the adaptation controller would specifically make decisions about problem selection based on the LLM's profile."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to mathematical reasoning assessment through its combination of procedural content generation with adaptive testing specifically for LLMs. While individual components like PCG (Johnson & Williams, 2024; Chen & Lee, 2023) and adaptive testing (White & Black, 2025) exist in the literature, the integration of these techniques into a comprehensive system for LLM evaluation represents a significant innovation. The proposal's focus on generating problems on-the-fly to mitigate data contamination, coupled with its adaptive nature that targets specific reasoning skills, distinguishes it from existing static benchmarks like MATH and GSM8k. The fine-grained diagnostic profiling approach also goes beyond current evaluation methods by providing detailed insights into model capabilities across different mathematical domains and reasoning skills."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. It draws appropriately from the literature on procedural content generation, adaptive testing, and mathematical reasoning evaluation. The system architecture is logically structured with clear components that work together coherently. The adaptation mechanism is grounded in principles from Bayesian inference and item response theory. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened. For instance, while the proposal mentions using a performance tracking vector Î¸_LLM and an update rule, it doesn't fully specify how this vector would be initialized or how the update function would handle the multidimensional nature of mathematical reasoning skills. Additionally, the proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential challenges in ensuring that procedurally generated problems maintain consistent difficulty levels and mathematical validity."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach overall, but with several implementation challenges that could affect its practicality. The PCG engine for mathematical problems is ambitious and would require significant expertise in both mathematics and procedural generation. Ensuring that generated problems are mathematically valid, have unique solutions, and target specific reasoning skills at controlled difficulty levels is non-trivial. The adaptation mechanism, while theoretically sound, would need careful calibration to work effectively. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive but resource-intensive, requiring evaluation of multiple LLMs on thousands of generated problems. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could benefit from more detailed contingency plans. The timeline for implementation is not specified, which raises questions about the feasibility of completing all components within a reasonable research timeframe."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current LLM evaluation methodologies for mathematical reasoning. As highlighted in the literature review, data contamination and static benchmarks are significant limitations in assessing true reasoning capabilities (Brown & Green, 2024; Kurtic et al., 2024). By developing a dynamic, adaptive assessment framework that generates novel problems, the research could substantially advance our understanding of LLMs' mathematical comprehension. The potential impacts are far-reaching: providing more reliable evaluation metrics for the research community, guiding targeted improvements in LLM development (connecting to Xu et al.'s TATA framework, 2025), enhancing trustworthiness for critical applications, and potentially transferring to educational contexts. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's central question about ML comprehension of mathematics and could significantly influence how we measure progress in AI mathematical reasoning."
