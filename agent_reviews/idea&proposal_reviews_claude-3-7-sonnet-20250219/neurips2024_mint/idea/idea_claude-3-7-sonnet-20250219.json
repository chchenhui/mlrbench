        "justification": "The CAMIR idea aligns excellently with the MINT workshop's focus on foundation model interventions. It directly addresses the core topics of understanding model internals, developing interventions, and maintaining model capabilities while mitigating harmful behaviors. The proposal specifically targets the workshop's interest in 'mechanistic interventions' and 'targeted editing of model knowledge and/or behaviour' through its causal discovery and surgical intervention techniques. The Intervention Specificity Score also addresses the workshop's concern for 'maintaining general capabilities whilst specialising for specific tasks.' The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address parameter-efficient fine-tuning, though the surgical intervention approach is conceptually related."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The CAMIR proposal is well-articulated with a clear three-stage framework: causal discovery, interpretable mapping, and surgical interventions. The motivation and objectives are precisely stated, and the approach is logically structured. The introduction of the Intervention Specificity Score provides a concrete evaluation metric. However, some technical details remain somewhat abstract - for instance, the exact mechanisms for distinguishing correlation from causation in neural networks could be more specifically defined. Additionally, while the general approach is clear, the specific algorithms or mathematical formulations for implementing the causal discovery methods are not fully elaborated, which prevents it from receiving the highest clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "CAMIR demonstrates significant novelty by combining causal inference with activation engineering in a structured framework. While activation steering and interpretability research exist separately, the integration of causal discovery methods to identify specific pathways responsible for harmful outputs represents a fresh approach. The Intervention Specificity Score appears to be a novel metric for evaluating interventions. The research builds upon existing activation engineering methods but advances them through a causal framework, which is an innovative direction. It doesn't completely revolutionize the field (which would warrant a 9-10), but it offers a substantive new perspective by framing model interventions through a causal lens rather than correlation-based approaches that dominate current practice."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of CAMIR faces several challenges. Causal discovery in complex neural networks is notoriously difficult, and distinguishing true causation from correlation in these systems remains an open research problem. The proposal doesn't detail specific technical approaches to overcome these challenges. Creating interpretable maps linking activations to semantic concepts is also ambitious given the current state of interpretability research. The surgical intervention techniques would require precise control over activation pathways that may be highly interconnected. While the overall framework is conceptually sound and builds on existing research directions, implementation would likely encounter significant technical hurdles. The research is feasible but would require substantial methodological innovations beyond what's currently described."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is very high as it addresses a critical problem in AI safety and alignment. If successful, CAMIR could enable more precise control over foundation models' behaviors, potentially allowing developers to mitigate harmful outputs while preserving beneficial capabilities. This would represent a major advancement in responsible AI deployment. The causal framework could also provide deeper insights into model functioning beyond the immediate application to harmful content mitigation. The Intervention Specificity Score could become a standard evaluation metric for intervention techniques. The approach could significantly impact how we understand, control, and deploy foundation models, addressing pressing ethical and safety concerns in AI development."
