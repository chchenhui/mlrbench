        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the MINT workshop's focus on understanding foundation models and developing interventions to mitigate harmful content. The proposed Surgical Circuit Interventions (SCI) approach combines causal tracing techniques to identify harmful circuits with targeted interventions (LoRA-CB and AO), which aligns perfectly with the workshop's interest in activation engineering and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the literature, citing relevant works on causal tracing [5], activation steering [6], and low-rank adaptations [4], and directly addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review. The methodology is comprehensive and clearly builds upon existing approaches while proposing novel extensions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction effectively establishes the context and problem statement. The methodology section is particularly strong, with detailed explanations of the causal circuit identification process and the two proposed intervention methods (LoRA-CB and AO), including mathematical formulations. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined. However, there are a few minor areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) some details about the exact implementation of causal tracing could be more specific, (2) the relationship between the identified circuits and the intervention mechanisms could be more explicitly connected in some places, and (3) some of the placeholder citations make it slightly harder to trace the exact origins of certain techniques."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to harm reduction in foundation models through the combination of causal circuit identification and targeted interventions. While it builds upon existing techniques like causal tracing [5], LoRA [4], and activation steering [6], it introduces innovative extensions: (1) the application of causal tracing specifically for identifying harmful circuits, (2) the development of LoRA-CB, which applies low-rank adaptations only to identified circuits rather than entire layers, and (3) the context-dependent Activation Offsets method. This combination of mechanistic interpretability with targeted interventions represents a fresh perspective that goes beyond current approaches. The proposal is not entirely groundbreaking as it leverages existing techniques, but the integration and specific application to targeted harm reduction with minimal impact on general capabilities constitutes a significant innovation in the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in established techniques and literature. The methodology for circuit identification builds on causal tracing, and the intervention methods extend proven approaches like LoRA and activation steering. The mathematical formulations for the loss functions are appropriate, and the evaluation methodology is comprehensive. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the causal tracing approach assumes that harmful behaviors can be isolated to specific circuits, which may not always be the case for complex harms, (2) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in identifying consistent circuits across different inputs or model versions, and (3) there's limited discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach. Additionally, while the evaluation metrics are well-chosen, more details on statistical significance testing would strengthen the experimental design."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. Using open-source models like Llama or Mistral is practical, and the computational requirements for the interventions are designed to be minimal. The methodology leverages existing techniques that have been demonstrated to work in related contexts. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) reliably identifying causal circuits for complex harmful behaviors may be more difficult than anticipated, (2) the effectiveness of highly targeted interventions might vary significantly across different types of harms, (3) the proposal requires paired harmful/clean examples which may be difficult to curate for some harm types, and (4) the context-dependent activation offsets might introduce additional complexity during inference. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present notable hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety: how to mitigate specific harmful behaviors in foundation models without compromising their general capabilities. This is highly significant for several reasons: (1) it directly addresses the growing concern about harmful outputs from increasingly powerful AI systems, (2) it offers a more efficient and targeted alternative to costly full fine-tuning approaches, (3) it bridges the gap between mechanistic interpretability and practical interventions, potentially advancing both fields, and (4) if successful, it could enable more responsible deployment of foundation models across various applications. The approach of surgically targeting specific harmful circuits while preserving general capabilities could have far-reaching implications for AI alignment and safety. The proposal also contributes methodologically to the field of interpretability by providing practical applications of causal tracing techniques."
