        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The SCALPEL proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the MINT workshop's focus on foundation model interventions to mitigate harmful content while maintaining model capabilities. The proposal builds upon the research idea of surgical circuit interventions for targeted harm reduction, expanding it into a comprehensive framework. It effectively incorporates concepts from the literature review, including causal tracing (Doe & Smith, 2023), activation steering (Johnson & Lee, 2023), and low-rank adaptations (LoRA, FLORAIN). The methodology section clearly outlines approaches to identify minimal neural circuits responsible for harmful behaviors and develop targeted interventions, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's topics of understanding foundation models, interventions, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The proposal addresses all key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly the challenges of identifying causal neural circuits, developing targeted interventions, and maintaining model capabilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the three-phase methodology (circuit identification, intervention design, and evaluation) is thoroughly explained with appropriate technical details. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented, making the technical approach understandable. The proposal effectively communicates both the problem being addressed and the proposed solution. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the circuit breakers and activation steering vectors could be more explicitly differentiated, (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'patching') might benefit from more explanation for broader accessibility, and (3) the intervention selection framework could be elaborated further to clarify how it integrates with the other components. Despite these minor issues, the proposal remains highly comprehensible and well-articulated overall."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The SCALPEL proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing techniques into a novel comprehensive framework for precision harm mitigation. While individual components like causal tracing, low-rank adaptations, and activation steering have been explored in prior work (as cited in the literature review), the proposal innovates by combining these approaches into a cohesive methodology specifically designed for surgical circuit interventions. The concept of 'circuit breakers' that can be selectively activated represents a fresh perspective on model interventions. The proposal's three-phase approach (identification, intervention, evaluation) offers a more systematic framework than existing methods. However, the core techniques themselves are largely adaptations of existing methods rather than fundamentally new approaches. The intervention selection framework that dynamically adjusts intervention strength based on harm potential is a novel contribution, but builds substantially on existing work. Overall, while not groundbreaking, the proposal offers meaningful innovation through its integration and application of existing techniques to the specific problem of precision harm mitigation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The causal tracing approach for circuit identification builds on established techniques from the literature (Doe & Smith, 2023) and is formalized with appropriate mathematical notation. The circuit refinement process using iterative pruning is methodologically sound for identifying minimal circuits. The intervention design phase presents two complementary approaches (circuit breakers and activation steering vectors) with clear mathematical formulations and optimization objectives. The evaluation framework is comprehensive, covering harm mitigation, capability preservation, and robustness analysis. The proposal acknowledges trade-offs between harm reduction and performance preservation through the loss function formulation (λ₁·L_harm + λ₂·L_preserve). The technical formulations are mostly correct and clearly presented. One minor limitation is that the proposal could provide more details on the statistical significance testing mentioned in the evaluation section. Additionally, while the intervention selection framework is conceptually sound, more details on the training of the harm potential classifier would strengthen the technical foundation. Overall, the proposal demonstrates rigorous methodology with solid theoretical foundations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and methods. The causal tracing techniques have been demonstrated in prior work (Doe & Smith, 2023), and low-rank adaptations like LoRA are well-established in the field. The dataset creation process for identifying harmful circuits is practical and builds on existing benchmarks. The computational requirements, while substantial, are significantly less than full model fine-tuning, making the approach more accessible. The evaluation framework utilizes existing benchmarks, which is practical for implementation. However, there are some feasibility challenges: (1) identifying minimal circuits in very large foundation models may be more complex than presented, potentially requiring significant computational resources for the causal tracing process; (2) the creation of specialized datasets with 500-1000 carefully curated example pairs for each harmful behavior represents a substantial manual effort; (3) the effectiveness of the proposed circuit breakers may vary across different model architectures and scales, potentially requiring architecture-specific adaptations. Despite these challenges, the overall approach remains feasible with current technology and reasonable resources, though some aspects may require refinement during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The SCALPEL proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety: mitigating harmful outputs from foundation models without compromising their general capabilities. This research has significant potential impact across multiple dimensions. Academically, it advances mechanistic interpretability by developing methods to identify and intervene in specific neural circuits, contributing to our fundamental understanding of foundation models. Practically, it offers a computationally efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for harm mitigation, making safety interventions more accessible and deployable. The societal impact is substantial, as more precise control over foundation model outputs could help prevent various harms while preserving beneficial uses. The proposal explicitly addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly the tension between targeted interventions and maintaining model capabilities. The expected outcomes include not just academic contributions but practical tools (open-source implementation with pre-trained circuit breakers) that could be immediately useful to the AI community. The significance extends to policy implications, potentially informing AI governance approaches. While the impact depends on the effectiveness of the interventions in practice, the proposal presents a compelling case for the importance and potential impact of this research direction."
