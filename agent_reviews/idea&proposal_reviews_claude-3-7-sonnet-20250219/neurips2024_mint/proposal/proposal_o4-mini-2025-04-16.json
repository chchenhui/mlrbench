    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the MINT workshop's focus on foundation model interventions to mitigate harmful content while maintaining model capabilities. The methodology builds upon the causal tracing techniques mentioned in the literature review (Doe & Smith, 2023) and incorporates low-rank adaptation methods similar to LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) and FLORAIN (Jiang et al., 2025). The proposal's emphasis on surgical interventions targeting specific neural circuits responsible for harmful behaviors is consistent with the research idea of targeted harm reduction with minimal impact on general performance. The evaluation metrics and baselines are comprehensive and directly address the key challenges identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for the circuit discovery process and intervention design. The experimental design section provides specific datasets, baselines, and metrics for evaluation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact process for identifying harmful circuits could be more precisely defined, particularly regarding the selection of baseline activations; (2) the relationship between the two proposed approaches (activation offsets vs. weight editing) could be more explicitly compared; and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'harm detector c(y)') are introduced without full explanation of their implementation details."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining causal tracing with low-rank interventions in a novel pipeline specifically designed for harm mitigation. While individual components draw from existing work (causal tracing from Doe & Smith, low-rank adaptations from LoRA and FLORAIN), the integration of these approaches into a unified framework for circuit-level interventions represents a fresh perspective. The proposal's innovation lies in its focus on identifying minimal circuits responsible for harmful behaviors and applying surgical interventions specifically to those circuits. However, the core techniques of low-rank adaptation and activation steering are extensions of existing methods rather than fundamentally new approaches, which somewhat limits the novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods from the literature. The mathematical formulations for circuit discovery via causal tracing and the two intervention approaches (low-rank activation offsets and weight editing) are rigorous and theoretically justified. The multi-term objective function balances toxicity reduction, fluency preservation, and parameter regularization in a principled way. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations and includes ablation studies to characterize trade-offs. One minor concern is that the causal tracing methodology assumes a binary harm score c(y), which may oversimplify the complex nature of harmful content, but this doesn't significantly detract from the overall soundness of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The circuit discovery phase requires significant computational resources to perform interventional ablation across all candidate circuit elements in large foundation models. The low-rank intervention approaches are computationally efficient and have been demonstrated in similar contexts (e.g., LoRA, FLORAIN). The data requirements are reasonable, using established benchmarks for toxicity and bias evaluation. The proposal includes a clear plan for reproducibility with open-source code and documentation. However, the scalability of the circuit discovery process to very large models (hundreds of billions of parameters) may be challenging, and the effectiveness of the interventions may vary across different types of harmful behaviors, requiring model-specific tuning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety: mitigating harmful outputs from foundation models without degrading their general capabilities. The significance is high due to several factors: (1) the approach offers a more precise and efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for harm mitigation; (2) the methodology advances interpretability by mapping harmful behaviors to specific neural circuits; (3) the parameter-efficient nature of the interventions makes them practical for deployment in resource-constrained environments; and (4) the framework is adaptable to various types of harmful behaviors beyond toxicity and bias. The potential impact extends beyond academic research to practical applications in deploying safer AI systems in sensitive domains like education and healthcare. The proposal also has implications for AI policy and regulation by offering concrete tools for ensuring compliance with safety standards."
