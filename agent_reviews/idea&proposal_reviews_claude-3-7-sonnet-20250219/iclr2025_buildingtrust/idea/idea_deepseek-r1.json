        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on building trust in language models. It directly addresses point #2 (improving reliability and truthfulness of LLMs) and point #8 (error detection and correction) from the workshop scope. The proposal aims to reduce hallucinations and increase factual accuracy, which are central concerns for trustworthiness. The self-correcting mechanism also indirectly supports explainability (#3) by making the model's confidence levels transparent. The focus on high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal advice perfectly matches the workshop's concern with real-world applications where trust is paramount."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating both the problem (LLMs generating plausible but incorrect outputs) and the proposed solution (a two-component framework for error detection and correction). The methodology is well-defined, explaining how the internal confidence scorer and retrieval-augmented corrector would work together in an iterative process. The expected outcomes are quantified (30-50% reduction in hallucination rates). Minor ambiguities exist around the specific implementation details of the confidence scorer and how the model would balance accuracy with latency in practice, but these are reasonable omissions for a research proposal of this length."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. While retrieval-augmented generation and uncertainty quantification in LLMs are active research areas, the integration of these approaches into a self-correcting framework that iteratively improves its outputs is innovative. The use of self-attention patterns for confidence scoring is particularly interesting. However, the core components build upon existing research directions rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The novelty lies more in the integration and application to trustworthiness rather than in developing entirely new methodological approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology and methods. The two main components (confidence scoring and retrieval-augmented correction) build on established techniques. Implementing the confidence scorer using self-attention patterns is technically viable given recent advances in LLM interpretability. The retrieval component can leverage existing knowledge bases and retrieval methods. The main implementation challenges would be in calibrating the confidence thresholds, ensuring the retrieval system accesses reliable information, and managing the computational overhead of multiple iterations. The 30-50% reduction in hallucination rates is ambitious but not unrealistic given the proposed approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in AI trustworthiness with potentially high impact. Hallucinations and factual errors are major barriers to deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal advice. A successful implementation could significantly advance trust in LLMs for critical applications. The approach is particularly significant because it aims to make models self-correcting rather than relying on external verification, which could dramatically improve scalability. The potential to transform LLMs into self-improving systems has broad implications beyond the immediate use cases mentioned. This work could influence how LLMs are deployed across industries where accuracy and reliability are non-negotiable requirements."
