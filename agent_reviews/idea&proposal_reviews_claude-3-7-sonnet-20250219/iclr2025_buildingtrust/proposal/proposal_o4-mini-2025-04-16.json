    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Error detection and correction' and 'Improving reliability and truthfulness of LLMs' by developing a framework for self-correcting language models. The proposal expands on the core idea of combining an internal confidence scorer with a retrieval-augmented corrector, providing detailed methodology that is consistent with the initial research idea. The literature review highlights existing work on self-correction in language models, and the proposal builds upon these foundations while addressing identified challenges such as error detection accuracy and computational overhead. The proposal includes evaluation on benchmarks mentioned in the literature (TruthfulQA, FEVER) and targets the expected 30-50% reduction in hallucination rates specified in the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with formal definitions, pseudo-code, and mathematical formulations that make the implementation path clear. The confidence scoring mechanism and retrieval-augmented correction process are thoroughly defined. The experimental design section clearly outlines benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating retrieved evidence into the correction process could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the confidence threshold τ and the quality of corrections could be more explicitly analyzed, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., ECE for calibration) are introduced without full explanation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing techniques into a novel framework. The integration of uncertainty quantification based on both token entropy and attention variability for error detection is innovative, as is the iterative loop that alternates between generation, error detection, evidence retrieval, and revision with formal stopping criteria. While self-correction and retrieval augmentation have been explored separately in the literature review, their tight coupling in an end-to-end system with confidence-driven iteration represents a fresh approach. However, the proposal shares conceptual similarities with existing work on self-correction (as noted in the literature review), and the individual components (uncertainty estimation, retrieval augmentation) build upon established methods rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The novelty lies more in the integration and application than in the creation of entirely new methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established techniques from uncertainty quantification, information retrieval, and language modeling. The mathematical formulations for confidence scoring are precise and theoretically sound, combining entropy-based uncertainty with attention pattern analysis. The iterative correction process is formalized as an optimization problem with clear stopping criteria. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the weighted combination of entropy and attention variability (α parameter) lacks theoretical motivation, (2) the relationship between local token confidence and span-level factual correctness could be more rigorously established, and (3) the convergence properties of the iterative process could be more formally analyzed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation details. The authors specify using open-source LLMs (LLaMA-2 13B) with LoRA fine-tuning, standard retrieval techniques (Faiss for ANN search), and widely available datasets (FEVER, TruthfulQA). The computational requirements (NVIDIA A100 GPUs) are substantial but within reach of academic and industry research labs. The expected latency increase (<2× relative to a single forward pass) seems reasonable given the iterative nature of the approach. However, there are feasibility concerns: (1) the retrieval system requires indexing 100M passages, which is resource-intensive, (2) the iterative correction process may face challenges with error propagation or oscillation between corrections, (3) the manual annotation required for evaluation is labor-intensive, and (4) the approach assumes access to high-quality external knowledge bases, which may not be available for all domains. While ambitious, the proposal includes reasonable constraints (maximum iterations T) and implementation details that make it practically achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in LLM deployment: hallucinations and factual errors that undermine trust. By developing an automated framework for error detection and correction, it has the potential to significantly impact high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance where reliability is paramount. The expected 30-50% reduction in hallucination rates would represent a substantial improvement in model trustworthiness. The framework's modular design makes it potentially applicable across multiple LLM architectures, increasing its reach. The work bridges theoretical research on uncertainty quantification with practical applications, addressing a key gap identified in the workshop description. Beyond technical contributions, the proposal explicitly connects to broader societal impacts, including reducing human effort in fact-checking, informing policy and regulation, and establishing best practices for trustworthy AI. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on factual errors rather than addressing all aspects of trustworthiness (e.g., bias, privacy), but within its scope, the potential impact is considerable."
