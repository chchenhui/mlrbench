    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Error detection and correction' and 'Improving reliability and truthfulness of LLMs.' The framework's dual components (internal confidence scorer and retrieval-augmented corrector) match the research idea's outline perfectly. The proposal builds upon the literature review by acknowledging recent work (SuperCorrect, ISC, STaSC) and addressing identified challenges like computational overhead and domain generalization. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines from the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions the challenge of 'Balancing Correction and Creativity,' this aspect receives limited attention in the proposal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the algorithmic steps are presented with precise mathematical formulations. The framework components and their interactions are clearly explained and even visualized through a simple diagram. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the corrected spans back into the full response could be more detailed, (2) the process for tuning the parameters α, β, and θ is not fully specified, and (3) the relationship between the iterative refinement process and computational efficiency trade-offs could be more explicitly quantified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by combining multiple approaches in a unique way. The integration of internal confidence scoring based on both token entropy and self-attention variance represents a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The retrieval-augmented correction mechanism that specifically targets low-confidence spans is also innovative. However, many of the individual components build upon existing techniques mentioned in the literature review. For instance, the self-correction concept appears in all cited papers, and retrieval-augmented generation is a well-established technique. The proposal's novelty lies more in the specific combination and implementation of these techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The domain adaptation aspect adds some originality, but the core mechanisms share similarities with existing approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-defined mathematical formulations for confidence scoring, error detection, and retrieval-based correction. The methodology is grounded in established techniques from uncertainty quantification and information retrieval. The experimental design is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate component contributions. The confidence scoring mechanism combining token entropy and self-attention variance is theoretically well-motivated. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the assumption that self-attention patterns correlate with factual accuracy needs more support, (2) the iterative refinement process could benefit from convergence guarantees, and (3) the threshold-based approach for error detection might need more nuanced justification beyond a single threshold value θ. Overall, the technical foundations are solid but have a few areas that could be strengthened."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and evaluation metrics. The use of existing benchmarks (TruthfulQA, FEVER) and established evaluation methodologies enhances practicality. The modular architecture allows for incremental development and testing. However, several implementation challenges may affect feasibility: (1) computing reliable confidence scores based on self-attention patterns requires significant model instrumentation and may not generalize across different LLM architectures, (2) the retrieval component requires high-quality, domain-specific knowledge bases that may not be readily available for all domains, (3) the iterative refinement process could introduce substantial latency in real-time applications, and (4) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the computational overhead challenge identified in the literature review. While the research is implementable with current technology, these challenges may require more resources or time than anticipated."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in LLM deployment—trustworthiness through automated error detection and correction—which has substantial implications for high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal advice. The potential 30-50% reduction in hallucination rates would represent a significant advancement in LLM reliability. The framework's modular design enables adaptation to various domains, enhancing its broad applicability. The open-source implementation promises to benefit the wider research community. The work bridges theoretical understanding of uncertainty in LLMs with practical deployment concerns, addressing a gap identified in the workshop scope. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on post-generation correction rather than preventing errors during generation, and the proposal could more explicitly address how the approach might scale to very large models or resource-constrained environments. Nevertheless, the potential impact on trustworthy AI deployment is substantial."
