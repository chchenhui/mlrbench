    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Generative AI for formal methods' theme from the VerifAI workshop by proposing LLM-TAC to automate tactic generation in interactive theorem provers. The proposal maintains fidelity to the original research idea of a two-stage framework with contextual encoding, tactic generation/verification, and reinforcement learning. It thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, building upon LeanDojo's retrieval mechanisms, LLMSTEP's tactic suggestions, and COPRA's execution feedback approach. The proposal addresses all key challenges identified in the literature review, including contextual understanding, tactic generation accuracy, and integration with proof assistants."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formalism. The algorithmic design is particularly well-explained, with detailed equations for the contextual encoding, tactic generation, and reinforcement learning components. The evaluation metrics are clearly defined in a tabular format. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for how the RL loop integrates with the LLM fine-tuning process could be more explicitly detailed, (2) some technical terms (e.g., SerAPI) are used without introduction, and (3) the relationship between the baseline models and the proposed approach could be more clearly differentiated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining three key components in a novel way: retrieval-augmented contextual encoding, LLM-based tactic generation with execution verification, and reinforcement learning for iterative refinement. While individual elements draw from existing work (e.g., LeanDojo's retrieval mechanisms, COPRA's execution feedback), the integration of these components into a cohesive end-to-end system represents a fresh approach. The introduction of a reward function that balances execution success with linguistic similarity to human tactics is particularly innovative. However, the core techniques themselves (retrieval-augmented LLMs, execution-guided learning) are extensions of approaches already explored in the literature rather than fundamentally new methods, which limits the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the retrieval mechanism, tactic generation probabilities, and reinforcement learning objective are well-defined and theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate metrics, baselines, and evaluation procedures, including both automated metrics and human evaluation. The data collection and preprocessing steps are thoroughly described. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and offers mitigation strategies. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the linguistic reward component of the RL objective could be better justified theoretically, (2) the baseline comparison could include more detailed statistical analysis methods, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly address how the system handles the undecidability inherent in theorem proving."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation paths. The use of existing tools (Coq, Lean, SerAPI) and models (Llama-3-8A) grounds the work in established technologies. The data collection strategy leverages existing libraries (Coq Standard Library, mathcomp), and the evaluation metrics are measurable. The proposal acknowledges implementation challenges like execution latency and overfitting, offering reasonable mitigation strategies such as model quantization and regret minimization. However, several feasibility concerns remain: (1) the computational resources required for training and fine-tuning LLMs with RL may be substantial, (2) the integration with theorem provers' complex environments may present unforeseen challenges, and (3) the expected improvement metrics (50% reduction in manual effort, 62.3% TSR) seem optimistic given the current state of the art, requiring strong empirical validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical bottleneck in formal verification: the manual labor required for tactic engineering in interactive theorem provers. Successfully automating tactic generation could substantially accelerate formal verification across mathematics and software, directly aligning with the VerifAI workshop's goals of bridging formal methods and AI. The expected outcomes include both technical contributions (the LLM-TAC framework) and practical resources (datasets and APIs), which could benefit the broader research community. The societal impact section convincingly argues for democratizing formal verification by reducing the expertise barrier. The proposal's focus on maintaining formal guarantees while leveraging probabilistic methods addresses a fundamental tension in the field. While the significance is high, the proposal could more explicitly quantify the potential impact beyond the ITP community to achieve the highest significance score."
