        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The FedPrompt idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing the intersection of federated learning and foundation models. It directly tackles the challenges mentioned in the task: privacy concerns, computational burdens, and regulatory constraints when fine-tuning foundation models. The proposal specifically addresses prompt tuning in federated settings and personalization of FL with foundation models, which are explicitly listed as topics of interest. The idea also touches on resource efficiency and adaptive aggregation strategies, which are other key topics mentioned. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some aspects like fairness or interpretability challenges, but these weren't central requirements of the task."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The FedPrompt idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation clearly establishes the problem context, the main idea section articulates the proposed approach with specific technical details (class-level prompts, adaptive clustering, static global model), and the outcome section projects potential impacts. The framework's core mechanisms are well-defined, including how prompts are optimized locally and aggregated via clustering. The evaluation metrics (accuracy, latency, compression ratios) and baselines are explicitly stated. The only minor ambiguities are around the specific implementation details of the adaptive clustering mechanism and how exactly the prototype updates would work, which would benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "FedPrompt demonstrates strong novelty by combining two cutting-edge areas: parameter-efficient prompt tuning and federated learning. While both prompt tuning and federated learning exist separately, their integration—especially with the adaptive clustering mechanism for prompt aggregation—represents a novel contribution. The idea of using class-level prompts instead of full model updates in FL settings is innovative and addresses a gap in current research. The approach of keeping the foundation model static while only sharing prompt vectors is a creative solution to the communication overhead problem. It's not entirely revolutionary as it builds upon existing techniques, but the combination and specific implementation details offer a fresh perspective that hasn't been thoroughly explored in the literature."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The FedPrompt idea is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Prompt tuning is an established technique, and federated learning frameworks exist that could be adapted for this purpose. The communication efficiency gains from only sharing prompt vectors instead of full model weights are realistic and implementable. However, there are moderate challenges: (1) The adaptive clustering mechanism might be complex to implement effectively, especially with heterogeneous data across clients; (2) Ensuring that class-level prompts generalize well across different data distributions requires careful design; (3) The theoretical convergence guarantees for clustered aggregation might be difficult to establish rigorously. These challenges don't undermine the core feasibility but would require careful engineering and theoretical work."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of FedPrompt is exceptionally high. It addresses a critical bottleneck in the deployment of foundation models: the need for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient fine-tuning. By reducing communication overhead by orders of magnitude while preserving privacy, it could enable widespread adoption of foundation models in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. The approach could democratize access to state-of-the-art AI capabilities for resource-constrained organizations. The potential impact extends beyond the specific implementation to establishing design principles for parameter-efficient federated learning more broadly. The work directly addresses the emerging challenges highlighted in the task description regarding the intersection of foundation models and federated learning, making it highly relevant to current research priorities."
