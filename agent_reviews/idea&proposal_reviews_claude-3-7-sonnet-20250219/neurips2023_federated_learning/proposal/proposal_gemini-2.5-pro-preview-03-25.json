    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of adapting foundation models in federated settings while preserving privacy, which is central to the task description. The proposal implements the core concept from the research idea of federated prompt tuning with lightweight parameter sharing and heterogeneity-robust aggregation. It builds upon the literature review by acknowledging existing work (FedBPT, FedDTPT, Fed-BBPT) while identifying and addressing their limitations, particularly in handling data heterogeneity in white-box settings. The proposal maintains consistency throughout, with clear connections between the background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach easy to understand. The overall framework of FedTune is explained step-by-step, and the three proposed aggregation strategies (PWA, USCA, SWA) are described with sufficient detail. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying models, datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The only minor areas that could benefit from further clarification are: (1) more specific details on the implementation of secure aggregation protocols, and (2) clearer distinction between the novel contributions and existing methods in some parts of the methodology section."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The primary novelty lies in the heterogeneity-robust aggregation strategies (PWA, USCA, SWA) specifically designed for federated prompt tuning, which address a gap in existing literature. While federated prompt tuning itself is not entirely new (as evidenced by the cited works like FedBPT), the proposal innovates by focusing on white-box gradient-based approaches rather than black-box API-only methods, and by explicitly addressing data heterogeneity challenges. The integration of privacy-preserving techniques (SecAgg and DP) with prompt tuning in federated settings also adds a novel dimension. However, some components like the basic FedTune framework build upon existing concepts in federated learning and prompt tuning, and the privacy mechanisms (SecAgg, DP) are standard approaches in federated learning rather than novel contributions."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodologies. The FedTune framework is built on established principles from both federated learning and prompt tuning, with clear mathematical formulations for the optimization process and aggregation strategies. The heterogeneity-robust aggregation methods are theoretically justified and logically constructed to address the identified challenges. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics that will allow for rigorous validation of the proposed methods. The privacy preservation techniques are based on well-established approaches (SecAgg and DP) with proper consideration of their theoretical guarantees. The only minor limitation is that some theoretical analysis of convergence properties under the proposed aggregation strategies could strengthen the soundness further."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly feasible research plan with realistic scope and implementation details. The use of accessible foundation models (RoBERTa, ViT) and standard datasets (GLUE, CIFAR) ensures practical implementation. The computational requirements, while significant, are manageable compared to full model fine-tuning approaches. The methodology leverages existing frameworks (PyTorch, Flower, FedML) for implementation, further enhancing feasibility. The experimental design is comprehensive yet achievable within a reasonable research timeframe. The only potential challenges that might affect feasibility are: (1) the implementation of secure aggregation protocols, which can be complex in practice, and (2) the computational resources required for experiments across multiple datasets, prompt tuning methods, and aggregation strategies. However, these challenges are acknowledged and appear manageable given the overall approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem at the intersection of foundation models, federated learning, and privacy-preserving AI. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) Practical: By enabling efficient adaptation of foundation models in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, the research could directly benefit real-world applications where data cannot be centralized; (2) Technical: The proposed heterogeneity-robust aggregation strategies could advance the state of federated learning beyond prompt tuning; (3) Accessibility: By drastically reducing computational and communication requirements, the approach democratizes access to foundation model capabilities for resource-constrained organizations; (4) Privacy: The integration of privacy-preserving techniques ensures responsible AI development aligned with regulatory requirements. The expected outcomes are clearly articulated and would make meaningful contributions to both research and practice in this rapidly evolving field."
