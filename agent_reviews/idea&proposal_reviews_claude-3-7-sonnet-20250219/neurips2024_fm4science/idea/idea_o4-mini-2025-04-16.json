        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The SciCred idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description, particularly addressing the 'Challenges' section that explicitly asks 'How to quantify the scientific uncertainty of foundation models?' SciCred directly tackles this by embedding principled uncertainty estimation into foundation models for scientific applications. It also addresses the 'Opportunities' section by proposing integration with 'classic scientific tools' through simulation oracles. The idea spans multiple scientific domains mentioned in the task (protein folding, battery materials, climate forecasting) and focuses on the intersection of foundation models and scientific discovery, which is the core theme of the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The SciCred idea is presented with strong clarity, clearly articulating the problem (overconfident predictions in scientific foundation models), the proposed solution (uncertainty-aware foundation model), and the technical approach (Bayesian neural layers, deep ensembles, evidential learning). The implementation details are well-specified, including the fine-tuning process, integration of simulation oracles, and evaluation metrics. The only minor ambiguities are around the specific details of the hybrid loss function and how exactly the meta-learning loop works with simulation oracles, which would benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "SciCred demonstrates good novelty in combining several existing uncertainty quantification techniques (Bayesian neural layers, deep ensembles, evidential learning) specifically for scientific foundation models. The integration of classical simulation oracles in a meta-learning loop for uncertainty recalibration is a fresh approach. The proposed Scientific Calibration Score (SCS) appears to be a new metric for this domain. However, the core uncertainty quantification methods themselves are established techniques rather than groundbreaking new approaches, and the application to scientific domains, while valuable, builds upon existing work in uncertainty-aware ML."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Uncertainty quantification techniques like Bayesian neural networks and deep ensembles are well-established, and foundation models for scientific applications already exist. The integration of simulation oracles is practical given the availability of quantum solvers and finite-element tools. However, there are moderate challenges: (1) computational costs of Bayesian neural layers and deep ensembles at foundation model scale could be prohibitive, (2) calibrating uncertainties across diverse scientific domains simultaneously may require significant domain expertise, and (3) the meta-learning loop with simulation oracles would need careful design to be computationally tractable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "SciCred addresses a critical problem in scientific AI: the lack of reliable uncertainty estimates that can guide experimental design and resource allocation. This is particularly important in high-stakes scientific domains where experiments are costly and errors can have serious consequences. The reported 30% reduction in high-error predictions and improved experiment prioritization would have substantial real-world impact on scientific discovery efficiency. By making foundation models more trustworthy for scientific applications, SciCred could accelerate adoption of AI in conservative scientific communities and potentially lead to faster scientific breakthroughs across multiple domains."
