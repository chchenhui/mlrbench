        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns very well with the task description, particularly addressing the challenge of 'How to align scientific foundation models with scientific facts without hallucination?' which is explicitly mentioned in the Challenges section. The proposal directly tackles the issue of scientific hallucinations and factual alignment, which is a core concern in the workshop description. The idea also touches on reusability across scientific domains and performance improvement, which are mentioned in the Progress section of the task. The approach is clearly situated within the foundation models for science paradigm that the workshop is focused on."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with good clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (hallucinations in foundation models when applied to scientific domains), proposes a specific solution (knowledge-infused fine-tuning with a dual-objective loss function), and outlines the expected outcomes (models that maintain capabilities while being more factually consistent). The methodology involving curating domain-specific datasets and developing a knowledge consistency loss is well-defined. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how exactly the knowledge consistency loss would be implemented, how the knowledge base would be structured, and what specific scientific domains would be prioritized."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to scientific foundation model alignment. While fine-tuning foundation models is not new, the specific combination of standard task-specific loss with a knowledge consistency loss that penalizes outputs contradicting a curated scientific knowledge base represents a fresh approach. The focus on scientific domains specifically, rather than general factual alignment, adds originality. However, similar approaches have been explored in other contexts (e.g., knowledge graph-enhanced language models, fact-checking systems), so it's an innovative application and extension of existing concepts rather than a completely groundbreaking methodology."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology and methods. Fine-tuning foundation models is a well-established practice, and incorporating additional loss terms is technically viable. The creation of domain-specific scientific datasets, while labor-intensive, is achievable through collaboration with domain experts and leveraging existing scientific databases. The main implementation challenges would be in effectively representing scientific knowledge in a form that can be used for the consistency loss calculation and ensuring that the fine-tuning process doesn't compromise the model's general capabilities. These challenges are significant but surmountable with appropriate expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in applying foundation models to scientific domains. Hallucinations and factual inconsistencies severely limit the trustworthiness and utility of these models for scientific applications where accuracy is paramount. Successfully aligning foundation models with scientific facts would enable more reliable use in hypothesis generation, literature review, experimental design, and data interpretation across multiple scientific fields. The potential impact is substantial, as it could accelerate scientific discovery while maintaining rigor and factual correctness. This work could establish a methodology that becomes standard practice for deploying foundation models in scientific contexts."
