    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description, particularly addressing the challenge of 'How to align scientific foundation models with scientific facts without hallucination?' which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop's 'Challenges' section. The proposal directly tackles the critical issue of hallucinations in scientific foundation models, which is a key concern highlighted in the task. The hybrid approach combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning also addresses the 'Opportunities' section's question about enabling integration with classic scientific tools. The focus on scientific domains like materials science and biomedicine also matches the scientific domains listed in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined problem (hallucinations in scientific foundation models), a specific solution approach (symbolic-augmented models with constraint integration), and a concrete implementation strategy (two-step inference process). The explanation includes a clear example in materials science to illustrate the concept. However, some minor ambiguities remain regarding the exact mechanisms for integrating symbolic constraints into the loss function and how the knowledge graphs would be constructed or maintained across different scientific domains, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by proposing a hybrid approach that integrates neural foundation models with symbolic reasoning, which represents a fresh perspective on addressing hallucinations. While neuro-symbolic approaches exist in AI research, their specific application to scientific foundation models with embedded physical laws and domain constraints represents an innovative direction. However, the core components (neural networks, symbolic reasoning, constraint-based learning) are established techniques being combined in a new way rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts, which is why it doesn't receive a higher novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. While both foundation models and symbolic reasoning systems exist separately, integrating them effectively presents considerable technical difficulties. Encoding complex scientific principles as differentiable constraints in loss functions is non-trivial, and creating comprehensive knowledge graphs for diverse scientific domains requires substantial expert input. The two-step inference process may also introduce computational overhead that could limit practical applications. These challenges are surmountable but would require considerable research effort and domain expertise to implement successfully."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in scientific AI applications where hallucinations can have serious consequences. Ensuring factual correctness in domains like drug discovery or materials science is essential for real-world adoption and trust. If successful, this approach could significantly accelerate scientific discovery while maintaining reliability, potentially leading to breakthroughs in fields like biomedicine and materials science. The impact extends beyond a single domain, offering a generalizable framework that bridges data-driven and first-principles approaches across scientific disciplines, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals of transformative scientific AI."
