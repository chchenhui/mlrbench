    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of uncertainty quantification in scientific foundation models, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description under 'Challenges.' The proposal follows the research idea of developing a Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification, incorporating all key elements mentioned: variational inference techniques, domain-specific priors, calibration metrics, and visualization tools. The literature review is thoroughly integrated, with references to works like IB-UQ (Guo et al., 2023), NeuralUQ (Zou et al., 2022), and calibration metrics (Davis & Brown, 2024). The proposal acknowledges the key challenges identified in the literature review, including scalability of Bayesian methods, integration of domain knowledge, and calibration of uncertainty estimates. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions multiple scientific domains (quantum chemistry, materials science, computational physics, biomedicine), it could have more explicitly connected to some of the specific domains mentioned in the task description like astrophysics and earth science."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the Bayesian neural network formulation, variational inference approach, domain-specific priors, and evaluation metrics, with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly described. The timeline and expected outcomes are clearly presented. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the frozen foundation model parameters and the Bayesian treatment could be more explicitly explained, (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'scaffold splits') are used without definition, and (3) the visualization tools section could provide more concrete examples of how uncertainty would be visualized for specific scientific applications."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its comprehensive approach to uncertainty quantification for scientific foundation models. The integration of domain-specific scientific laws and empirical constraints into Bayesian priors is innovative, as is the focus on developing calibration metrics specifically for scientific applications. The proposal also introduces novel visualization tools tailored for domain scientists. However, many of the individual components build upon existing methods in Bayesian neural networks and variational inference. The use of stochastic gradient variational Bayes, the reparameterization trick, and variational dropout are established techniques. While the proposal combines these elements in a novel way for scientific foundation models, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithmic approaches to Bayesian inference or uncertainty quantification. The novelty lies more in the application context and integration of components rather than in developing entirely new methodological foundations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on well-established theoretical foundations in Bayesian statistics and variational inference. The mathematical formulations for the variational inference approach, including the ELBO objective and reparameterization trick, are correctly presented. The incorporation of domain-specific priors through gradient penalties and constraint terms in the likelihood is well-justified and mathematically coherent. The evaluation metrics (NLPD, CRPS, ECE) are appropriate for assessing uncertainty quantification. The experimental design, including comparison with relevant baselines and ablation studies, is comprehensive and rigorous. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal could provide more details on how to handle the computational challenges of applying variational inference to very large foundation models, (2) the approach to validating the quality of the domain-specific priors could be more thoroughly explained, and (3) the statistical significance testing methodology could be more detailed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with a reasonable timeline and clear milestones. The methodology builds on established techniques in Bayesian neural networks and variational inference, which increases its implementability. The selection of specific scientific domains and datasets provides concrete targets for evaluation. The computational challenges are acknowledged, and mitigation strategies (GPU clusters, parameter sharing, low-rank approximations) are proposed. However, there are significant implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) scaling variational inference to foundation-model size networks remains computationally intensive, even with the proposed optimizations, (2) defining appropriate domain-specific priors for diverse scientific applications requires deep expertise in multiple scientific domains, (3) the 12-month timeline may be ambitious given the breadth of tasks (implementation, experimentation, visualization tools, user studies), and (4) the evaluation across multiple scientific domains may require more extensive computational resources than anticipated. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present substantial hurdles that may require adjustments to the scope or timeline."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the application of foundation models to scientific domains. Uncertainty quantification is essential for scientific applications where reliability and trustworthiness are paramount, making this research highly significant. The potential impact spans multiple scientific domains, including quantum chemistry, materials science, computational physics, and biomedicine. The expected outcomes—a publicly released library, empirical evidence of superior calibration, best practices guidelines, and peer-reviewed publications—would provide valuable resources to the scientific community. The broader impacts are well-articulated and compelling, including enabling trustworthy AI adoption in experimental sciences, accelerating scientific discovery through targeted data collection, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and supporting ethical decision-making in high-stakes applications like drug design and climate modeling. The proposal directly addresses one of the key challenges identified in the task description ('How to quantify the scientific uncertainty of foundation models?'), making it highly relevant to the workshop's focus. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's potential to bridge the gap between powerful AI capabilities and the rigorous uncertainty requirements of scientific research."
