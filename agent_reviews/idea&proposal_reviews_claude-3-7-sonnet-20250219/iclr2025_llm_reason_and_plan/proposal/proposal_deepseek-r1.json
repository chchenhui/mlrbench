    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks' by proposing an Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP) that dynamically allocates computational resources during LLM planning. The proposal incorporates key elements from the literature review, including concepts from AdaPlanner, LLM-DP, and AdaLLaVA, while extending them with a novel meta-reasoning controller. The methodology clearly builds upon the research idea of balancing solution quality and computational cost through dynamic resource allocation. The proposal also addresses the workshop's interest in reinforcement learning methods and efficient inference techniques for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and timeline. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described in detail, including the meta-reasoning controller architecture, resource allocation mechanisms, and training methodology. Mathematical formulations are provided for the difficulty score calculation and reward function. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive, with specified baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there could be more clarity on how exactly the meta-reasoning controller will assess task difficulty beyond the general formula provided, and some additional details on the implementation of the different computation modes would strengthen the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining meta-reasoning with reinforcement learning to create an adaptive inference system specifically for planning tasks. While adaptive computation and dynamic resource allocation have been explored in works like AdaLLaVA and LLM-RAO, this proposal innovates by focusing specifically on planning tasks and introducing a three-tiered resource allocation approach (minimal, moderate, and high effort) based on difficulty scores. The integration of multiple adaptation mechanisms (CoT depth, beam search width, and tool invocation) in a unified framework is a fresh perspective. However, the core concept of adaptive computation during inference builds upon existing work rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, which limits its groundbreaking potential."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods. It builds upon solid theoretical foundations from reinforcement learning, meta-reasoning, and LLM planning. The methodology is rigorous, with a clear formulation of the meta-reasoning controller, resource allocation mechanisms, and training approach using PPO. The experimental validation plan includes appropriate baselines and metrics to evaluate both task performance and computational efficiency. The mathematical formulations for the difficulty score and reward function are correct and well-presented. The proposal acknowledges the trade-offs between success rate and inference time, incorporating both into a cost-adjusted score. The only minor weakness is that some assumptions about the effectiveness of the difficulty estimation function could be more thoroughly justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of established benchmarks (ALFWorld, MiniWoB++) and open-source LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral) increases practicality. The timeline of 12 months is reasonable for the scope of work. However, several aspects may require significant effort: (1) designing an effective meta-reasoning controller that accurately assesses task difficulty, (2) implementing the dynamic switching between different computation modes without disrupting the planning process, and (3) training the controller via RL to optimize the balance between performance and efficiency. The extension to multi-modal tasks in months 7-9 may be particularly challenging given the added complexity of cross-modal reasoning. Overall, while ambitious, the proposal is implementable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical limitation in current LLM-based planning systems: the inefficient allocation of fixed computational resources regardless of task complexity. By enabling dynamic resource allocation, the AIP framework has the potential to significantly impact several domains: (1) reducing inference time by 30-50% would make LLMs more practical for real-time applications in robotics and autonomous systems, (2) improving success rates by 15-20% on complex tasks would enhance reliability in critical applications, and (3) reducing the carbon footprint of LLM inference aligns with growing concerns about AI's environmental impact. The research also contributes theoretical insights into meta-reasoning and adaptive computation that could influence future model architectures. The significance is somewhat limited by its focus on specific planning benchmarks rather than a broader range of reasoning tasks, but within its domain, the potential impact is substantial."
