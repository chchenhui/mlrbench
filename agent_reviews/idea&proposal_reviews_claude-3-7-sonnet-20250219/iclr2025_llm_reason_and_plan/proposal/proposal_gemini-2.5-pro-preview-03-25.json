    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on enhancing reasoning and planning capabilities in LLMs through efficient inference techniques (Workshop Topic 2) and incorporates reinforcement learning for optimization (Workshop Topic 1). The proposed Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP) framework precisely implements the core idea of dynamically allocating computational resources based on planning step difficulty. The proposal thoroughly acknowledges and builds upon the literature, citing relevant works like AdaPlanner, LLM-DP, and AdaLLaVA, while addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review (dynamic resource allocation complexity, efficiency/performance balance, adaptability, integration, and evaluation). The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed approach will tackle these challenges through meta-reasoning and RL-based resource allocation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research design is logically presented, with detailed explanations of the AIP framework components (meta-reasoning module and resource allocation module), the RL training approach, and evaluation methods. Mathematical sketches help formalize the approach. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined baselines, procedures, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of how the meta-reasoning module will be integrated with the base LLM could be more specific, (2) the transition between planning steps and when/how the AIP modules are invoked could be more precisely defined, and (3) some technical details about the RL training process (e.g., episode termination conditions, state representation) could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several innovative components into a cohesive framework. The combination of meta-reasoning for difficulty assessment with RL-based dynamic resource allocation specifically for LLM planning is a fresh approach. While individual elements like adaptive computation (AdaLLaVA), planning with LLMs (AdaPlanner, LLM-DP), and RL for optimization have been explored separately in the literature, the proposal offers a novel integration of these concepts with specific focus on planning tasks. The multi-dimensional resource allocation (controlling inference steps, CoT depth, beam width, tool use, and model selection simultaneously) is particularly innovative. However, the core concept of adaptive computation for efficiency is not entirely new, as evidenced by the cited works, which somewhat limits the novelty score. The proposal builds upon existing ideas rather than introducing a completely new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The RL framework is appropriately formulated with clearly defined states, actions, and a reward function that balances success, quality, and computational cost. The choice of PPO as the RL algorithm is well-justified given its stability and suitability for the task. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. The meta-reasoning approaches are grounded in established techniques like uncertainty estimation and auxiliary prediction. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to assess component contributions. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal could more thoroughly address potential failure modes of the meta-reasoning module, (2) the reward function design might benefit from more detailed justification of the weighting parameters, and (3) the proposal could more explicitly discuss how to handle the potential instability in RL training with LLMs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, though with some implementation challenges. The core components (meta-reasoning, RL-based allocation) are implementable with current technology and methods. The use of established benchmarks (ALFWorld, Blocks World, WebShop) provides a solid foundation for evaluation. The experimental design is realistic and well-structured. However, several aspects present feasibility concerns: (1) training an RL agent to control resource allocation in LLMs may require significant computational resources and careful hyperparameter tuning, (2) integrating the meta-reasoning module with the base LLM inference loop might be technically challenging depending on model architecture and access, (3) the multi-dimensional resource allocation space could lead to a complex RL training process requiring extensive exploration, and (4) some of the proposed resource dimensions (like dynamically switching between models of different sizes) may present practical implementation challenges. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is feasible with sufficient resources and technical expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant challenge in scaling LLM reasoning and planning capabilities through efficient resource allocation. If successful, the AIP framework would make a valuable contribution to the field by: (1) substantially improving computational efficiency for LLM planning, making these capabilities more accessible and practical for real-world applications, (2) enhancing performance on complex planning tasks by focusing resources where they're most needed, (3) advancing our understanding of meta-reasoning in LLMs, and (4) providing a foundation for future work on adaptive computation in other reasoning tasks. The research directly aligns with multiple workshop topics and addresses key challenges identified in the literature. The potential impact extends beyond planning to other reasoning-intensive tasks and multi-modal settings. While not completely transformative of the field, the proposal targets an important problem with a well-designed approach that could significantly advance the state-of-the-art in efficient LLM reasoning."
