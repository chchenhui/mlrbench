    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks' by proposing Adaptive Meta-Planning (AMP) for dynamic computational resource allocation. The proposal builds upon the literature review, particularly referencing AdaPlanner (Sun et al., 2023) and LLM Dynamic Planner (Dagan et al., 2023), while also incorporating concepts from adaptive computation in multimodal contexts (Xu et al., 2025) and resource allocation in wireless environments (Noh et al., 2025). The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all consistent with the core idea of developing an adaptive inference mechanism that can assess planning step complexity and allocate resources accordingly."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The technical details, including mathematical formulations for complexity assessment and resource allocation, are well-defined. The algorithm for Adaptive Meta-Planning is presented in a clear, step-by-step format. The proposal includes detailed explanations of the Complexity Assessment Module (CAM), Resource Allocation Controller (RAC), and Learning Optimizer components. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more specific details on how the verification steps would work and how the curriculum learning would be implemented in practice. The figures mentioned (e.g., 'Figure 1') are described textually but not actually provided, which slightly reduces clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to dynamic computational resource allocation for LLM planning. While adaptive computation and meta-reasoning are not entirely new concepts, the specific application to LLM planning and the comprehensive framework combining complexity assessment, resource allocation, and reinforcement learning optimization is innovative. The proposal extends beyond existing work by introducing a meta-reasoning component that can assess planning step complexity and a mechanism for dynamically allocating various computational resources (inference depth, sampling parameters, tool usage, verification steps). The integration of these components into a cohesive framework trained through reinforcement learning represents a fresh perspective. However, some individual components build directly on existing techniques (e.g., PPO for RL training, entropy-based uncertainty estimation), which somewhat limits the overall novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established techniques from reinforcement learning, uncertainty estimation, and LLM planning. The mathematical formulations for complexity assessment and resource allocation are technically sound, and the training procedure is well-defined. The proposal includes detailed algorithms and implementation specifics that enhance its technical rigor. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, covering multiple benchmarks and metrics. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. The approach to balancing planning effectiveness and computational efficiency through a parameterized reward function is theoretically sound. However, there could be more discussion of potential failure modes or theoretical limitations of the approach, particularly regarding the challenges of learning effective complexity assessment from limited training data."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction, though with some implementation challenges. The core components (CAM, RAC, Learning Optimizer) can be implemented using existing technologies and methods. The evaluation benchmarks (ALFWorld, BabyAI, WebShop, GSM8K) are established and accessible. The training procedure, including supervised pre-training and RL fine-tuning, follows standard practices. However, there are several practical challenges that may affect feasibility: 1) The computational resources required for training the full system could be substantial, especially for end-to-end RL training with large LLMs; 2) Obtaining human annotations for planning step complexity (for supervised pre-training) may be time-consuming and subjective; 3) The integration of multiple components (base LLM, CAM, RAC) into a cohesive system that operates efficiently during inference presents engineering challenges. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do increase the implementation complexity and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in LLM planning: the inefficient allocation of computational resources across planning steps of varying complexity. The potential impact is significant across several dimensions. From a practical perspective, achieving the stated goal of 30-50% reduction in computational costs without sacrificing planning quality would make LLM planning more economically viable and environmentally sustainable for real-world applications. The theoretical contributions to understanding meta-reasoning and uncertainty monitoring in LLMs could influence future research directions. The proposal also has broader implications for AI sustainability through optimized resource usage. The significance extends beyond the specific planning domain to other reasoning-intensive LLM applications. The transferability of the approach to new planning domains not seen during training would further enhance its impact. While the proposal focuses on a specific aspect of LLM planning (computational efficiency), its potential to influence both practical applications and theoretical understanding of LLM reasoning makes it highly significant."
