        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the workshop's focus on reasoning and planning for LLMs. It specifically addresses the 'Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks' topic by proposing dynamic resource allocation during inference. The hierarchical adaptive computation framework directly tackles the question of 'How can models dynamically allocate resources during inference to optimize for reasoning and planning?' The proposal also touches on training methodologies through its RL-based planner, which connects to the workshop's interest in RL applications for reasoning. However, it doesn't explicitly address some other workshop topics like multi-modality, benchmarking, or collaborative reasoning, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The two-stage hierarchical framework is explained concisely, and the role of the planner module is well-defined. The proposal also specifies concrete benchmarks (GSM8K and HotpotQA) and quantitative expectations (30-50% faster inference). However, some technical details remain ambiguous - for instance, how exactly the sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts architecture integrates with the two-stage framework, how the reward function balances correctness vs. efficiency, and what specific RL algorithm would be used to train the planner. These gaps prevent the idea from achieving perfect clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines several existing concepts (hierarchical computation, Mixture-of-Experts, RL-based routing) in a novel way specifically for LLM reasoning. The hierarchical approach to computational efficiency in LLMs is relatively fresh, especially the two-stage design with a lightweight planner. However, adaptive computation and conditional computation have been explored in various forms in deep learning literature, and Mixture-of-Experts architectures are well-established. The RL-based gating mechanism for controlling computation is somewhat innovative in the LLM context, but not revolutionary. The proposal represents a meaningful extension and combination of existing techniques rather than a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces several implementation challenges. Training an effective planner module that can accurately assess task complexity is non-trivial, especially since the reward signal (balancing accuracy and efficiency) would be complex to optimize. The RL training process might be unstable and computationally expensive. Additionally, integrating a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with dynamic routing into existing LLM frameworks would require significant engineering effort. The expected 30-50% inference speedup while maintaining accuracy is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve across diverse reasoning tasks. While the individual components (RL, MoE, hierarchical models) are established techniques, their integration for this specific purpose presents substantial technical hurdles that would require considerable resources and expertise to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research addresses a critical challenge in LLM deployment: the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning capability. If successful, this approach could significantly impact how LLMs are deployed in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments, potentially democratizing access to powerful AI systems. The 30-50% inference speedup would be meaningful for applications like robotics and real-time tutoring mentioned in the proposal. The idea also contributes to the broader goal of making AI systems more adaptable and efficient. However, the significance is somewhat limited by focusing primarily on inference optimization rather than addressing fundamental reasoning limitations in LLMs, and the approach might not generalize well across all types of reasoning tasks."
