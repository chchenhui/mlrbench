        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on incorporating behavioral science insights into machine learning systems. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of integrating formal models of human cognition into AI systems, specifically targeting the alignment of LLMs with human reasoning processes. The proposal explicitly mentions using computational cognitive architectures (ACT-R, CLARION) to guide LLM training, which perfectly matches the 'Computational cognitive science' topic. It also addresses the 'Alignment' topic by proposing methods to align LLMs with models of human behavior, and touches on 'Interpretability' by aiming to make LLM reasoning more psychologically interpretable. The idea's focus on measuring behavioral congruence with human experiments further demonstrates its alignment with the workshop's evaluation interests."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating both the problem (LLMs lacking transparent, human-like reasoning) and the proposed solution (using cognitive architectures to guide LLM training and inference). The methodological approach is well-defined with two specific components: (1) a hybrid training objective and (2) a constrained decoding mechanism. The evaluation strategy is also clearly outlined, focusing on behavioral congruence with human experiments and user-perceived naturalness. While the overall framework is well-articulated, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration - for instance, how exactly the cognitive model 'traces' would be operationalized and integrated into the training objective, or how the constrained decoding would be implemented without significantly compromising performance. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to integrating established cognitive architectures with modern LLMs. While both cognitive architectures and LLMs are well-established individually, their integration in the manner proposed - particularly using cognitive model traces to guide training and constrained decoding - represents a fresh approach. The proposal goes beyond simply using cognitive science as inspiration and suggests concrete mechanisms for embedding cognitive processes into LLM training and inference. The hybrid training objective that combines language modeling loss with alignment to cognitive model traces is particularly innovative. The approach is not entirely without precedent, as there have been efforts to make LLMs more human-like and to incorporate cognitive science insights into AI, but the specific methodology proposed here offers a novel combination and implementation strategy that could advance the field in meaningful ways."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. While both cognitive architectures and LLMs are well-established, integrating them presents significant technical hurdles. Cognitive architectures like ACT-R operate on different principles than neural networks, making their integration non-trivial. The proposal to create a hybrid training objective would require developing methods to translate cognitive model traces into a form that can guide neural network training, which is technically complex. Additionally, constrained decoding based on cognitive architecture predictions could significantly increase computational demands during inference. The evaluation approach using human behavioral congruence is feasible but would require careful experimental design. The resources required for implementation would be substantial, including expertise in both cognitive modeling and LLM training, as well as significant computational resources. While challenging, these obstacles are not insurmountable, making the idea somewhat feasible but requiring considerable effort and innovation to implement successfully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: making language models reason in ways that are transparent and aligned with human cognitive processes. The significance is substantial for several reasons. First, it could significantly enhance trust in AI systems by making their reasoning processes more interpretable and psychologically plausible. Second, it bridges the gap between cognitive science and machine learning, potentially creating more robust theoretical foundations for AI development. Third, the practical applications in education, healthcare, and human-AI teams could lead to more effective collaboration between humans and AI systems. The approach could also advance our understanding of human cognition itself by creating computational implementations of cognitive theories that can be tested at scale. If successful, this research could influence how future AI systems are designed, moving beyond pure performance metrics toward systems that better complement human cognitive processes. The potential for both theoretical advancement and practical impact across multiple domains makes this idea highly significant."
