        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on incorporating behavioral science insights into AI systems. It directly addresses the 'Interpretability' topic by using behavioral models (cognitive biases) to improve AI system interpretability. The proposal also touches on 'Computational cognitive science' by incorporating formal models of human cognition (cognitive biases) into AI interpretability frameworks. The idea precisely addresses the workshop's goal of converting qualitative behavioral insights into computational models for AI systems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (difficulty in interpreting AI failures), proposes a specific approach (mapping AI failures to cognitive biases), and outlines the expected output (bias attribution explanations). The methodology is described in general terms, mentioning analysis of model inputs, internal states, and outputs. However, it could benefit from more specific details about the technical implementation of the bias detection mechanisms and how exactly the mapping between AI behaviors and cognitive biases would be formalized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea offers a fresh perspective by applying established cognitive bias frameworks to AI interpretability. While both cognitive biases and AI interpretability are well-studied separately, their integration in this manner appears relatively novel. The approach of using human cognitive error patterns as a lens to understand AI failures provides an innovative framing. However, some work has already been done on anthropomorphizing AI errors and examining biases in AI systems, so it's not entirely unprecedented. The novelty lies more in the systematic mapping and attribution framework rather than in the basic concept."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research faces moderate feasibility challenges. On one hand, there's a rich literature on cognitive biases to draw from, and methods exist for analyzing AI system behaviors. On the other hand, establishing clear, reliable mappings between AI failure modes and specific cognitive biases will be challenging. The proposal doesn't detail how to rigorously identify when an AI error truly resembles a cognitive bias versus when the resemblance is superficial. Developing metrics to validate these mappings and ensuring they provide genuine explanatory power rather than just post-hoc rationalizations will require significant methodological innovation. The research is feasible but will require careful experimental design and validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important problem in AI interpretability. If successful, it could provide more intuitive explanations of AI failures that are accessible to non-technical users, potentially increasing trust and facilitating better human-AI collaboration. The approach could bridge gaps between technical AI explanations and human understanding by leveraging familiar concepts from psychology. It could also lead to new debugging approaches and potentially help identify systematic weaknesses in AI architectures. The significance extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in improving AI system reliability and user experience."
