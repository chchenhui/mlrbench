        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on incorporating behavioral science insights into AI systems. It directly addresses the 'Computational creativity' topic by integrating the Geneplore psychological model of human creativity into transformer architectures. The proposal also touches on 'Alignment' by training models on human creativity ratings and 'Evaluation' through human assessments of the generated outputs. The idea fundamentally aims to bridge cognitive theory and generative AI, which is precisely what the workshop seeks to explore."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and methodology. The two-phase architecture (generate and explore) is explained concisely, and the implementation approach through transformer modules and critic networks is well-defined. The three methodological steps provide a good roadmap for implementation. However, some technical details could be more specific - for instance, how exactly the 'perturbing of learned embeddings within semantic subspaces' would be implemented, or what specific information-theoretic surprise metrics would be used."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by explicitly incorporating a psychological theory of creativity (Geneplore) into transformer architectures. While transformers and generative models are common, the structured two-phase approach that mimics human creative processes represents a fresh perspective. The feedback loop between generation and exploration phases to emulate iterative divergent/convergent thinking is particularly innovative. The approach isn't entirely unprecedented (some creativity-focused AI systems exist), but the specific integration of Geneplore theory with modern transformer architectures and the focus on human-like creative processes represents a novel direction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research appears largely feasible with current technology. Transformer architectures are well-established, and the two-phase approach builds on existing techniques. However, several challenges exist: 1) Creating appropriate creativity annotations for pretraining could be resource-intensive and subjective; 2) Designing effective information-theoretic surprise metrics that correlate with human judgments is non-trivial; 3) The feedback mechanism between generate and explore phases may require careful engineering to avoid mode collapse or other optimization issues. While these challenges are significant, they don't appear insurmountable given current ML capabilities."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important gap in current generative AI systems - their lack of human-like creative processes. If successful, it could significantly advance computational creativity by producing outputs that are not just coherent but genuinely novel and surprising in ways humans find creative. The framework's potential applicability across multiple domains (text, image, design) enhances its significance. The work could also provide valuable insights into human creativity itself by operationalizing psychological theories. The impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in creative industries, though it may not solve the broadest challenges in AI alignment or interpretability."
