    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of incorporating behavioral science insights into AI systems, specifically focusing on alignment, computational cognitive science, and interpretability. The proposal faithfully implements the core idea of using cognitive architectures (ACT-R, CLARION) to guide LLM training and inference through a hybrid training objective and constrained decoding mechanism. The literature review is well-integrated, with explicit references to key papers like CoALA [1], LLM-ACTR [4], and cognitive model alignment work [2]. The proposal addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly regarding alignment, scalability, and evaluation of human-like reasoning."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical sequence with appropriate detail. The technical approach is explained with precise mathematical formulations for the hybrid training objective and constrained decoding mechanism. The experimental design includes specific baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact implementation details of how the cognitive architecture will generate valid next steps during constrained decoding, (2) more specifics on how the cognitive model traces will be collected or generated for training, and (3) clearer explanation of how the framework will handle potential conflicts between language modeling performance and cognitive alignment."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel approach to integrating cognitive architectures with LLMs. While previous work like CoALA [1] and LLM-ACTR [4] has explored similar concepts, this proposal introduces innovative elements: (1) the specific formulation of a hybrid training objective that combines language modeling with cognitive alignment, (2) the constrained decoding mechanism that uses cognitive model predictions to guide token generation, and (3) the comprehensive evaluation framework measuring both task performance and behavioral congruence. However, the core idea of using cognitive architectures to guide LLMs is not entirely new, as evidenced by the literature review. The proposal builds upon existing work rather than introducing a completely revolutionary approach, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness. The mathematical formulations for the hybrid training objective and constrained decoding mechanism are well-defined and theoretically grounded. The approach builds on established cognitive architectures (ACT-R, CLARION) and machine learning techniques. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including both quantitative metrics and user studies. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address how to handle potential inconsistencies between cognitive model predictions and optimal language model outputs, (2) the assumption that cognitive architectures can generate valid next steps for arbitrary reasoning tasks may need further justification, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential limitations or failure modes of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents moderate feasibility challenges. On the positive side, it builds on existing technologies (LLMs, cognitive architectures) and proposes incremental rather than revolutionary changes. The experimental design is reasonable, with clearly defined metrics and baselines. However, several significant implementation challenges exist: (1) Integrating cognitive architectures with LLMs at scale could be computationally expensive, especially during training; (2) Creating or obtaining high-quality cognitive model traces for diverse reasoning tasks would require substantial effort; (3) The constrained decoding mechanism might significantly slow down inference; (4) The proposal requires expertise in both cognitive science and machine learning, which might be difficult to find in a single research team. While these challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, they do represent substantial hurdles that would need to be overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in AI alignment and interpretability. Successfully integrating cognitive architectures with LLMs could lead to more transparent, trustworthy, and human-aligned AI systems. The potential applications in education, healthcare, and human-AI collaboration are significant and align well with the workshop's goals. The interdisciplinary nature of the work could help bridge the gap between behavioral sciences and machine learning, fostering collaboration across fields. The expected outcomes include concrete improvements in behavioral alignment and user trust, with quantifiable targets (≥15% higher SMS, ≥20% improvement in perceived naturalness). However, the proposal could more explicitly address how the approach would scale to more complex reasoning tasks beyond syllogistic reasoning and how it would handle domains where human reasoning itself might be suboptimal or biased."
