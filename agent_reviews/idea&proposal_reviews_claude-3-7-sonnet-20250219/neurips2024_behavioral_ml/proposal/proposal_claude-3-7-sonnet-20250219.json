        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of incorporating behavioral science insights into AI systems, specifically focusing on computational cognitive science and alignment of LLMs with human behavior. The proposal builds upon the literature review by extending work from Sumers et al. (2023), Wu et al. (2024), and Binz and Schulz (2023), while addressing the identified challenges of aligning cognitive models with LLMs. The methodology clearly implements the main idea of using cognitive architectures (ACT-R, CLARION) to guide LLM training and inference through a hybrid training objective and constrained decoding mechanism. The proposal comprehensively covers all aspects mentioned in the original idea and expands on them with detailed technical specifications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with formal mathematical definitions of the hybrid loss function, cognitive alignment loss, and constrained decoding mechanism. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, providing a comprehensive framework for assessing the proposed approach. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for translating cognitive processes to neural network operations could be more precisely defined, (2) the implementation details of the cognitive trace generation system could be elaborated further, and (3) the relationship between the cognitive reward function and human preferences in the RLHF phase could be more explicitly formulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of established cognitive architectures with modern LLM training and inference. While individual components like cognitive architectures (ACT-R, CLARION) and LLM training techniques are not new, the combination and specific implementation approach is innovative. The hybrid training objective that combines language modeling loss with cognitive alignment loss represents a fresh perspective on LLM training. The constrained decoding mechanism that guides LLM generation based on cognitive architecture predictions is also innovative. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing work (e.g., CoALA framework, LLM-ACTR) rather than introducing entirely new concepts, and similar ideas of aligning LLMs with cognitive models have been explored in the literature review, though perhaps not with the same comprehensive approach or technical detail."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The approach is grounded in established cognitive architectures (ACT-R, CLARION) and modern machine learning techniques. The mathematical formulations for the hybrid loss function, cognitive alignment loss, and constrained decoding mechanism are technically sound and well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate controls, diverse datasets, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. The three-phase training approach (initial fine-tuning, cognitive alignment training, and reinforcement learning) is well-structured and builds logically on established training paradigms. The evaluation framework is comprehensive, with both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. However, there are some assumptions that could benefit from further justification, such as the effectiveness of the embedding distance for measuring similarity between reasoning steps and the optimal balance between language modeling and cognitive alignment objectives."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces significant implementation challenges. The integration of cognitive architectures with LLMs is technically complex and requires expertise in both cognitive science and machine learning. Creating the proposed datasets, particularly the Human Reasoning Benchmark with human reasoning traces, will require substantial resources and time. The computational requirements for training LLMs with the proposed hybrid objectives may be substantial. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential obstacles and mitigation strategies. The timeline for implementing all components (cognitive architecture integration, dataset creation, model training, and evaluation) is ambitious and may require prioritization of specific aspects. Additionally, the proposal does not fully address how to handle potential conflicts between cognitive architecture predictions and optimal LLM performance, which could create implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI research: the disconnect between how LLMs reason and how humans reason. By grounding LLM reasoning in established cognitive processes, this research has the potential to significantly enhance the transparency, trustworthiness, and utility of AI systems across multiple domains. The impact spans theoretical advances in bridging cognitive science and machine learning, practical applications in education, healthcare, and decision support, and contributions to responsible AI development. The approach directly addresses the workshop's focus on behavioral machine learning and computational cognitive science. If successful, this research could establish a new paradigm for developing AI systems that reason in more human-like, interpretable ways, potentially transforming how humans interact with and trust AI systems. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and provides a convincing case for the significance of the research."
