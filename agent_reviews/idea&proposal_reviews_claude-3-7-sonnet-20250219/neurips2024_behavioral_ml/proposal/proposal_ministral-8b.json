    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of incorporating behavioral science insights into AI systems, specifically focusing on computational cognitive science and alignment of LLMs with human behavior. The proposal faithfully expands on the original idea of using cognitive architectures to guide LLM training and inference, maintaining the core components of hybrid training objectives and constrained decoding. The methodology references cognitive architectures like ACT-R mentioned in the literature review (e.g., paper #4 on LLM-ACTR), and the evaluation metrics align with the behavioral congruence mentioned in the original idea. The proposal also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as balancing performance with interpretability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is explained in detail, including mathematical formulations of the hybrid training objective. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, providing a clear roadmap for implementation. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the specific cognitive architectures to be used could be more explicitly tied to the literature review, (2) the exact implementation details of the cognitive model alignment loss could be more precisely defined, and (3) the connection between the constrained decoding mechanism and specific cognitive processes could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining cognitive architectures with LLM training and inference in a structured way. The hybrid training objective that combines language modeling loss with cognitive model alignment is innovative, as is the constrained decoding mechanism that prioritizes token sequences matching cognitive architecture-predicted steps. However, the core ideas build upon existing work in the literature review, such as the LLM-ACTR framework (paper #4) and cognitive preference alignment (paper #3). While the proposal offers a fresh perspective by focusing specifically on structuring latent reasoning pathways in LLMs based on cognitive models, it represents an evolution rather than a revolution in the field. The integration approach is novel, but the individual components (cognitive architectures and LLMs) are well-established."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established theoretical foundations from both cognitive science and machine learning. The methodology is well-justified and builds upon existing work in the literature. The hybrid training objective is mathematically formulated, and the evaluation metrics include both automatic and human evaluation, which is appropriate for assessing human-like reasoning. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) the exact formulation of the cognitive model alignment loss is not fully specified, (2) the mechanism for extracting and comparing cognitive model 'traces' with LLM reasoning pathways needs more detail, and (3) the proposal could benefit from a more thorough discussion of potential limitations and how they will be addressed. The experimental design is solid but could be strengthened with more specific details about the datasets and baseline models."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is somewhat feasible but presents several implementation challenges. The integration of cognitive architectures with LLMs is technically complex and requires expertise in both cognitive science and machine learning. The hybrid training objective and constrained decoding mechanism are conceptually sound but may require significant computational resources to implement effectively. The proposal acknowledges the need for both synthetic and real-world datasets, but does not fully address the challenge of creating or obtaining these datasets. Additionally, the human evaluation component, while essential, can be time-consuming and expensive. The literature review indicates that similar approaches have been attempted, suggesting feasibility, but the scale and complexity of the proposed integration may present practical challenges. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of computational requirements, data collection strategies, and potential implementation hurdles."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current LLM technology: the lack of transparent, human-like reasoning. By integrating cognitive architectures into LLMs, the research has the potential to significantly enhance the interpretability, trustworthiness, and alignment of these models with human cognition. This is particularly important for applications in education, healthcare, and human-AI collaboration, where transparency and trust are essential. The interdisciplinary nature of the research also promotes collaboration between computer scientists and behavioral scientists, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals. The impact extends beyond theoretical contributions to practical applications that could improve human-AI interaction across multiple domains. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and provides a compelling case for the significance of the research."
