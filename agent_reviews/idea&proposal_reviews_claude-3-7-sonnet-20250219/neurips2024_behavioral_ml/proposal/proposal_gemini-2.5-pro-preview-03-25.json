        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of incorporating behavioral science insights into AI systems, particularly focusing on alignment, evaluation, computational cognitive science, and interpretability. The proposal builds upon the research idea by developing a comprehensive framework for cognitive architecture-guided training and inference in LLMs. It thoroughly incorporates the literature review by addressing the key challenges identified (alignment, scalability, evaluation, generalization, and performance-interpretability balance) and building upon previous work like CoALA, LLM-ACTR, and cognitive preference alignment. The methodology section clearly outlines how cognitive architectures will guide both training and inference, as specified in the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction provides comprehensive context, the research objectives are specific and measurable, and the methodology section details the approach with appropriate technical depth. The mathematical formulations for the hybrid loss function and constrained decoding are particularly well-defined. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as the exact mapping between symbolic cognitive traces and natural language representations, and more concrete examples of how the cognitive architecture-constrained decoding would work in practice. The proposal is also quite lengthy, which occasionally impacts conciseness."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to integrating cognitive architectures with LLMs. While previous work has explored using cognitive models to guide LLMs (as noted in the literature review), this proposal innovates by developing a comprehensive framework that addresses both training and inference phases. The hybrid loss function that combines language modeling with cognitive alignment is particularly innovative, as is the cognitive architecture-constrained decoding mechanism. The proposal extends beyond existing approaches like CoALA and LLM-ACTR by focusing on verifiable alignment with human reasoning processes rather than just performance improvements. The evaluation methodology, which includes behavioral congruence and interpretability metrics, also represents a fresh approach to assessing cognitive alignment."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-grounded in both machine learning and cognitive science. The methodology builds upon established techniques in LLM training and cognitive modeling. The hybrid loss function and constrained decoding approach are theoretically justified, and the evaluation metrics are appropriate for the research objectives. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) The mapping between symbolic cognitive traces and natural language may introduce inconsistencies or ambiguities that aren't fully addressed; (2) The proposal assumes that cognitive architectures like ACT-R provide accurate models of human reasoning, which may not always be the case; (3) The computational feasibility of the constrained decoding approach during inference isn't thoroughly analyzed. These limitations somewhat reduce the overall soundness of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially feasible research agenda. The implementation of cognitive architecture-guided training seems achievable with current technology, especially given the existing work on integrating cognitive models with LLMs cited in the literature review. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Developing accurate ACT-R models for complex reasoning tasks requires significant expertise in cognitive modeling; (2) The computational cost of the constrained decoding mechanism could be prohibitive for real-time applications; (3) The proposal requires expertise across multiple domains (LLMs, cognitive architectures, evaluation methods); (4) The timeline for implementing all components (trace generation, hybrid training, constrained decoding, comprehensive evaluation) is ambitious. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could benefit from a more detailed risk mitigation strategy."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI research: the lack of transparent, human-like reasoning in LLMs. By integrating cognitive architectures with LLMs, the research has the potential to significantly advance the field of behavioral machine learning. The expected outcomes align perfectly with the workshop's focus areas, particularly alignment, evaluation using human models, computational cognitive science, and interpretability. If successful, this research could transform how we develop and evaluate AI systems, making them more trustworthy, interpretable, and aligned with human cognition. The potential applications in education, healthcare, and human-AI teaming are substantial and could lead to real-world impact. The proposal also contributes methodologically to both AI and cognitive science, potentially creating a bidirectional relationship where each field informs the other."
