    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on incorporating behavioral science insights into AI systems, particularly under the topics of alignment, computational cognitive science, and interpretability. The proposal faithfully expands on the research idea of using cognitive architectures (specifically ACT-R) to guide LLM training and inference through a hybrid training objective and constrained decoding. The literature review is thoroughly integrated, with the proposal building upon works like 'Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents' and 'Integrating Cognitive Architectures with Large Language Models for Enhanced Reasoning'. The methodology addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as alignment of cognitive models with LLMs and balancing performance with interpretability. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions CLARION as a cognitive architecture, the proposal primarily focuses on ACT-R, though it does mention CLARION as a potential alternative in the ablation studies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined, and the technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The hybrid loss function and constrained decoding mechanism are precisely specified with equations. The experimental design section comprehensively outlines datasets, baselines, ablations, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mapping between LLM hidden states and cognitive architecture states could be more explicitly defined; (2) The process of extracting and labeling cognitive operations from human reasoning transcripts could be elaborated; and (3) Some technical details about how the ACT-R simulator interfaces with the LLM during training could be further explained. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to integrating cognitive architectures with LLMs. While the literature review shows that others have explored similar concepts, this proposal offers several innovative contributions: (1) The specific hybrid loss function that combines language modeling with cognitive alignment penalties is a fresh approach; (2) The constrained decoding mechanism that incorporates cognitive model predictions during inference is original; (3) The comprehensive evaluation framework measuring both task performance and cognitive fidelity is distinctive. The proposal doesn't claim to invent cognitive architectures or LLMs, but rather creates a new bridge between these established fields. The approach of using KL divergence to align LLM predictions with cognitive model traces appears to be a novel technical contribution. While building on existing work in cognitive modeling and LLMs, the specific integration method and training objective represent a meaningful advancement beyond the current state of the art described in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations from both cognitive science and machine learning. The mathematical formulations for the hybrid loss function and constrained decoding are technically correct and well-justified. The use of ACT-R as a reference cognitive model is appropriate given its established status in cognitive science. The experimental design includes proper baselines, ablations, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle potential misalignment between the discrete operations in ACT-R and the continuous representations in LLMs; (2) There's limited discussion of how to validate that the cognitive model itself accurately represents human reasoning (the proposal assumes ACT-R is correct); (3) The hyperparameter selection process for λ and β could be more rigorously justified. While these limitations don't undermine the overall approach, they do represent areas where the theoretical foundations could be more thoroughly developed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially feasible research agenda. Several aspects support its feasibility: (1) The use of existing tools (ACT-R 7.9, GPT-2/LLaMA models) rather than building everything from scratch; (2) A clear computational setup with appropriate hardware; (3) A phased approach starting with smaller models before scaling up. However, significant challenges to feasibility exist: (1) Collecting and annotating human reasoning transcripts with cognitive operations is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise; (2) Integrating ACT-R with modern deep learning frameworks may present technical hurdles; (3) The computational cost of running ACT-R simulations alongside LLM training could be prohibitive at scale; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle cases where human reasoning and optimal problem-solving diverge. The timeline and resource requirements for this ambitious project are not explicitly discussed, which raises questions about its complete feasibility within a typical research timeframe. While the core ideas are implementable, the full scope as described would require substantial resources and expertise across multiple disciplines."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI research: the lack of human-like, interpretable reasoning in LLMs. Its significance is substantial for several reasons: (1) It creates a bridge between cognitive science and modern AI, potentially advancing both fields; (2) It directly addresses the alignment problem by grounding LLM reasoning in validated human cognitive processes; (3) The applications in education, healthcare, and collaborative work could have meaningful real-world impact; (4) The approach offers a path toward more transparent and trustworthy AI systems, addressing a major concern in current AI development. The proposal goes beyond incremental improvements to suggest a fundamentally different approach to training and using LLMs. If successful, this research could establish a new paradigm for developing AI systems that reason in human-like ways, making them more interpretable, trustworthy, and aligned with human values. The interdisciplinary nature of the work also opens new research directions at the intersection of cognitive science and AI."
