    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding why and how neural models learn similar representations, with a specific application to model merging across architectures. The proposal builds upon the Canonical Representation Hypothesis (CRH) mentioned in the literature review and addresses the 'You Are What You Eat' critique by explicitly conditioning on task properties. The methodology incorporates functional alignment techniques that connect to the SARA framework's hierarchical alignment approach. All five key challenges identified in the literature review are explicitly addressed in the proposal, particularly architectural disparities (Challenge 1) and task distribution variability (Challenge 2). The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions computational efficiency (Challenge 4), it could have more explicitly connected to the learning theory perspectives mentioned in the first literature review item."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is presented with appropriate mathematical formulations for both the Hierarchical Optimal Transport and Conditional Canonical Correlation Alignment methods. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. Tables are effectively used to present model pairs and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for task-conditioned filtering (𝓕_c) could be more explicitly defined; (2) The relationship between the stitching architecture and the gating mechanism could be elaborated further; and (3) Some technical terms (e.g., 'manifold transport') are used without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with the concepts. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is logically structured and generally clear in its presentation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong novelty in several aspects. The task-conditioned approach to functional alignment represents a fresh perspective that goes beyond existing model merging techniques. While functional alignment itself is not new, the explicit conditioning on task properties and the development of lightweight stitching operators that generalize across architectures are innovative contributions. The combination of Hierarchical Optimal Transport with task conditioning is particularly novel. The proposal also introduces a new framework for cross-architecture model merging that bridges theoretical alignment principles from neuroscience with practical engineering constraints. However, some components build upon existing methods (CCA variants, optimal transport) rather than introducing entirely new techniques. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work in parameter-space merging (like TiesMerging) and standard activation-space alignment, positioning TCFA as a novel approach that addresses limitations in both areas."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for HOT and CCCA are technically correct and appropriate for the alignment task. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that will effectively test the hypotheses. The connection to theoretical concepts like the Canonical Representation Hypothesis provides a solid grounding. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) The proposal lacks formal analysis of convergence properties or theoretical guarantees for the alignment methods; (2) While the lightweight stitching architecture is described, there's limited justification for why the proposed approximations will preserve alignment quality; (3) The relationship between task conditions and representation alignment could benefit from more formal characterization; and (4) The ablation studies, while comprehensive, don't fully address potential failure modes or limitations of the approach. Despite these limitations, the overall methodology is well-founded and follows sound scientific principles."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The model inventory includes standard architectures (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, BERT) that are widely available, and the datasets (ImageNet-1K, GLUE) are standard benchmarks. The alignment methods (HOT and CCCA) build on established techniques with known implementations. However, several aspects present implementation challenges: (1) The task-conditioned filtering mechanism may require significant tuning to identify meaningful activation subspaces; (2) Scaling the optimal transport computation to large activation matrices could be computationally intensive; (3) The conditional routing mechanism adds complexity that might require careful optimization; and (4) The expected 10-15% accuracy gain over baselines is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve consistently across all model pairs. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of computational requirements and potential bottlenecks. Overall, while the research is implementable with current technology and methods, it will require careful engineering and may face some practical challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem with both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it contributes to understanding how task-specific invariances govern representation alignment across architectures, directly addressing the workshop's core question about when and why neural models learn similar representations. Practically, it enables efficient model merging across heterogeneous architectures, which has substantial value for reducing computational costs in model deployment. The expected outcomes include both quantitative improvements (10-15% accuracy gain, >100× parameter efficiency) and theoretical contributions (conditioned alignment theory, architectural generalization framework). The work has broad applicability across vision and language domains, with potential extensions to multimodal systems. The interdisciplinary nature of the research, connecting neuroscience concepts with practical ML engineering, enhances its significance. The proposal directly addresses current limitations in model merging techniques, particularly for cross-architecture scenarios, which represents an important gap in the current literature. While the immediate impact is focused on model efficiency rather than fundamental scientific breakthroughs, the combination of theoretical and practical contributions makes this a significant research direction."
