    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central question of 'when, how, and why different neural models learn similar representations' by proposing Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment (TCFA) to identify and leverage functional similarities between models with different architectures. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, such as representation alignment (Insulla et al.), canonical representations (Ziyin et al.), and the relationship between data structure and model generalization (Lehalleur et al.). The methodology is comprehensive and clearly connects to the original research idea of using task-conditioned functional alignment for cross-architecture model merging. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions SARA's hierarchical alignment framework, the proposal doesn't explicitly incorporate this multi-level approach, though it does propose exploring different layers for alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research problem, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, including mathematical formulations for the alignment methods (OT and CCA-based). The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. The only areas that could benefit from further clarification are: (1) more specific details on how the task conditions will be defined and selected beyond the examples given, (2) clearer explanation of how the merged model will handle potential discrepancies in intermediate representations beyond the aligned layers, and (3) more concrete examples of the specific architectural pairs to be tested. Overall, the proposal is highly understandable and logically organized, with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to model merging by focusing on task-conditioned functional alignment rather than direct parameter space alignment. This represents a significant departure from conventional merging techniques like parameter averaging or naive stitching. The key innovation lies in conditioning the alignment on specific task properties, which allows for more semantically meaningful merging across architecturally diverse models. The use of Optimal Transport and CCA variants for finding minimal transformations between activation spaces is also innovative in this context. While some individual components (like using OT or CCA for representation alignment) have precedents in the literature, their combination and application to cross-architecture model merging, especially with the task-conditioning aspect, represents a fresh perspective. The proposal doesn't claim to be entirely groundbreaking but offers a novel integration of existing concepts to address an important problem in a new way."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in established theoretical frameworks. The mathematical formulations for the alignment methods (OT and CCA-based) are technically correct and appropriate for the task. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. However, there are some areas where the theoretical foundations could be strengthened: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential issues with alignment when the functional spaces of the two models are fundamentally incompatible for certain tasks, (2) there's limited discussion of the theoretical guarantees or bounds on the quality of the learned transformations, and (3) the relationship between task-conditioning and the generalization capabilities of the merged model could be more rigorously established. Despite these gaps, the overall approach is methodologically sound and builds appropriately on established techniques in representation learning and optimal transport."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The use of publicly available datasets and pre-trained models ensures reproducibility. The implementation of TCFA appears technically feasible, leveraging established methods like OT and CCA that have existing implementations. However, there are some practical challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) finding the right granularity of task conditions that meaningfully differentiate activations while still allowing for alignment could require significant experimentation, (2) the computational cost of extracting activations and computing alignments across many conditions and model pairs could be substantial, (3) the effectiveness of the approach may vary significantly across different architectural pairs, potentially requiring architecture-specific adaptations. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges through its ablation studies but might underestimate the difficulty of finding robust alignment transformations that generalize well across diverse inputs. Overall, the research is implementable but will likely require iterative refinement of the methodology based on initial results."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in machine learning: how to effectively combine knowledge from diverse pre-trained models without extensive retraining. If successful, TCFA could substantially reduce the computational resources needed for leveraging multiple models, making advanced AI capabilities more accessible. The research directly contributes to the workshop's goal of understanding representation similarities across neural systems and has both practical and theoretical significance. Practically, it could enable more flexible model reuse and combination across architectural boundaries. Theoretically, it would provide insights into when and how functionally equivalent representations emerge despite structural differences. The work could influence future research on model composition, transfer learning, and multi-modal integration. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on supervised learning scenarios and potentially the specific architectural pairs chosen for evaluation, but the underlying principles could have broader implications for understanding neural representations in both artificial and biological systems."
