        "justification": "The Meta-Contrastive Representational Alignment (MCRA) idea is highly aligned with the workshop's focus on understanding when, how, and why different neural models learn similar representations. The proposal directly addresses the core question of the workshop by providing a method to identify and enforce shared invariances across different model architectures. It specifically targets the alignment of representations between heterogeneous models (e.g., ResNet and ViT, or BERT and GPT), which is precisely what the workshop aims to explore. The idea also touches on model merging and stitching applications mentioned in the task description, and seeks to identify universal features that emerge during learning, another key aspect of the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear two-stage pipeline: (1) extracting and projecting hidden activations from different models into a unified embedding space, and (2) optimizing this projection using contrastive learning. The expected outcomes are also clearly defined. However, there are some minor ambiguities that could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific details of the sparsity penalty mechanism, how the lightweight mapping networks are designed, and how the approach would scale to very different architectures. The overall approach is understandable, but these technical details would make the methodology even clearer."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing techniques (contrastive learning, representation alignment) in a novel way to address the specific problem of cross-architecture representation alignment. While contrastive learning is well-established and representation alignment methods like CKA and SVCCA already exist, the meta-contrastive approach that specifically targets heterogeneous architectures appears to be relatively novel. The addition of a sparsity penalty to highlight universally salient features is an interesting innovation. However, the core techniques themselves (projection networks, contrastive learning) are adaptations of existing methods rather than fundamentally new approaches, which limits the novelty score somewhat."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is quite feasible with current technology and methods. Contrastive learning frameworks are well-established, and the projection networks described would be straightforward to implement. The evaluation metrics mentioned (CKA, SVCCA) are existing tools that can be readily applied. The main implementation challenges would likely involve tuning the contrastive loss and sparsity penalty to work effectively across very different architectures, and ensuring that the lightweight mapping networks are expressive enough to capture meaningful alignments without being too complex. Overall, the approach seems practical and implementable with current resources and knowledge, though it may require careful optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses an important problem in neural network research with potentially broad implications. Successfully aligning representations across different architectures could enable more effective model merging, transfer learning between heterogeneous models, and deeper insights into the fundamental abstractions that neural networks learn. The ability to identify universally salient features across different architectures could advance our understanding of neural network learning dynamics and potentially inform more efficient architecture design. The practical applications in model stitching without fine-tuning would be valuable for creating more efficient and capable systems. While the immediate impact might be primarily in the research community, the long-term implications for model efficiency and interpretability could be substantial."
