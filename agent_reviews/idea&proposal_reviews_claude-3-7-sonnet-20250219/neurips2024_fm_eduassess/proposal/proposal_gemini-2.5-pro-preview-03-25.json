    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' and 'Trustworthy AI for educational assessment.' The SecureED framework specifically targets the detection of AI-generated responses in educational assessments, which aligns perfectly with the research idea. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, particularly leveraging contrastive learning approaches from papers like ConDA (Bhattacharjee et al., 2023), DeTeCtive (Guo et al., 2024), and WhosAI (La Cava et al., 2024). It also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as detection accuracy, generalizability across domains, adversarial evasion tactics, explainability, and integration into educational platforms. The only minor inconsistency is that while the research idea mentions using LFMs themselves as part of the detection solution, the proposal focuses more on using contrastive learning with transformer-based models rather than explicitly leveraging LFMs for detection."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally very clear and well-structured. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the SecureED framework, including the data collection process, model architecture, contrastive learning objective, and experimental design. The mathematical formulation of the contrastive learning objective is particularly well-articulated, though there is a self-identified correction in the formulation that could have been integrated more seamlessly. The expected outcomes and impact are clearly delineated. There are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as the specific implementation details of the multimodality handling (how exactly mathematical responses will be parsed and represented) and more concrete details on the integration guidelines. Overall, the proposal is comprehensive and understandable, with only minor ambiguities that do not significantly impede comprehension."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by applying contrastive learning specifically to the educational assessment domain for AI-generated content detection. While contrastive learning for AI text detection has been explored in the cited literature (ConDA, DeTeCtive, WhosAI), SecureED innovates by: 1) focusing specifically on educational assessment responses across multiple modalities (text, code, mathematical reasoning); 2) emphasizing higher-order thinking tasks that are particularly relevant to education; 3) incorporating domain-specific features relevant to educational contexts; and 4) addressing the practical integration into educational platforms. The proposal builds upon existing approaches rather than introducing an entirely new paradigm, which limits its groundbreaking nature. However, the adaptation to the educational domain, the multimodal approach, and the focus on robustness against evasion tactics in this specific context provide sufficient novelty to distinguish it from prior work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. The contrastive learning framework is well-grounded in established machine learning principles, and the mathematical formulation of the learning objective is technically correct (after the self-correction). The research design includes appropriate data collection strategies, model architecture considerations, and evaluation metrics. The experimental design is comprehensive, including comparisons with relevant baselines, ablation studies, and multiple evaluation metrics covering performance, robustness, generalizability, and fairness. The proposal also acknowledges potential ethical considerations in data collection and privacy. The adversarial fine-tuning approach to enhance robustness is well-justified based on the literature review's identification of evasion tactics as a key challenge. There are some minor gaps, such as the lack of detailed discussion on potential limitations of the contrastive learning approach or potential failure modes of the system, but overall, the methodology is rigorous and well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, though with some implementation challenges. The contrastive learning approach and model architecture are implementable using existing deep learning frameworks and pre-trained models. The data collection strategy is realistic, acknowledging the need for ethical considerations and IRB approval. The evaluation methodology is well-defined and achievable. However, there are several aspects that may present challenges: 1) Collecting a sufficiently diverse and representative dataset of human responses across multiple subjects and modalities could be resource-intensive and time-consuming; 2) Ensuring the quality and authenticity of human responses might be difficult, especially for complex, higher-order thinking tasks; 3) The adversarial fine-tuning process could be computationally expensive and may require iterative refinement; 4) The multimodal aspect, particularly handling mathematical reasoning, may require specialized processing techniques that are not fully elaborated in the proposal. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is feasible with adequate resources and expertise, though it may require considerable effort to implement successfully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in educational assessment: maintaining integrity in the face of increasingly sophisticated AI tools that students might misuse. This research has significant potential impact in several ways: 1) It could provide educators with a reliable tool to detect AI-generated responses, preserving assessment validity; 2) The focus on explainability would enhance trust in the detection system among stakeholders; 3) The multimodal approach addresses a broader range of assessment types than many existing solutions; 4) The open-source framework and integration guidelines could facilitate practical adoption in educational settings. The significance extends beyond just detection to enabling the responsible integration of AI in education more broadly. While the impact might initially be limited to educational institutions with the technical capacity to implement such solutions, the potential for wider adoption and influence on educational assessment practices is substantial. The research directly addresses a pressing need identified in both the workshop call and the literature review, making it highly relevant to current challenges in educational technology."
