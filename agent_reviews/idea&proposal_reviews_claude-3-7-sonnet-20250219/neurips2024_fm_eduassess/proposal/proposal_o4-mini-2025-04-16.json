    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' by developing a robust detection framework for AI-generated content in educational assessments. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the contrastive learning approach, multimodal dataset spanning text/code/math, and adversarial training. It also builds upon the literature review by extending ConDA and DeTeCtive's contrastive learning approaches, addressing the limitations of current detection tools (GPTZero, Originality.AI) mentioned in the review, and incorporating explainability mechanisms to increase stakeholder trust. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions watermarking techniques, the proposal doesn't explicitly incorporate watermarking detection, though it does address adversarial evasion tactics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the three-component architecture (dual-encoder contrastive network, domain discriminator, explainability module) is well-defined. The technical details, including mathematical formulations for contrastive loss and domain adaptation, are precisely presented. The data collection, preprocessing, and experimental design sections provide comprehensive information about implementation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for handling multimodal inputs (especially diagrams) could be more explicitly defined, (2) the relationship between the contrastive learning approach and the final classification decision could be more clearly explained, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'cyclomatic complexity') are used without definition, which might be unclear to readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements: (1) applying contrastive learning specifically to educational content across multiple modalities (text, code, math, diagrams), (2) incorporating domain adaptation via adversarial training to ensure subject-invariant representations, (3) integrating explainability mechanisms for transparent feature attributions, and (4) designing a comprehensive framework that addresses both detection and prevention. While individual components like contrastive learning for AI detection (ConDA, DeTeCtive) and explainable AI for academic integrity have been explored in the literature review, the integration of these approaches into a unified, multimodal framework for educational assessment is novel. However, the core technical approach builds heavily on existing contrastive learning methods (particularly MoCo-style momentum updates and InfoNCE loss) and domain adaptation techniques (gradient reversal layer), rather than proposing fundamentally new algorithms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The contrastive learning approach is well-justified and mathematically formalized with the InfoNCE loss function. The domain adaptation mechanism using gradient reversal is a proven technique for achieving domain invariance. The adversarial training module incorporates multiple strategies (paraphrasing, back-translation, synonym substitution) to enhance robustness. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, with appropriate dataset splits, baseline comparisons, and metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential fairness concerns and includes measures to address them. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The only minor limitations in soundness are: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address how the model will handle completely novel LFMs that emerge after training, (2) there's limited discussion of potential limitations or failure modes of the approach, and (3) the explainability module relies on SHAP, which may have computational limitations for very large inputs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The data collection strategy leverages existing datasets (Stanford QA Dataset, CodeSearchNet, MATH dataset) and institution-provided assignments, making data acquisition practical. The model architecture builds on established techniques (Transformers, contrastive learning, SHAP) that have proven implementations. The training protocol specifies concrete hyperparameters and optimization strategies. The integration and API deployment plan is well-thought-out, with specific endpoints and integration pathways for LMS platforms. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) collecting and labeling a sufficiently diverse multimodal dataset across subjects may require significant effort, (2) the computational resources needed for training large Transformer models with contrastive learning on multimodal data could be substantial, (3) achieving the targeted performance improvements (≥10% F1 on in-domain, ≥15% on cross-domain) is ambitious given the challenges noted in the literature review, and (4) ensuring fairness across demographic groups may be challenging without explicit debiasing techniques."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and timely problem at the intersection of AI and education. As large foundation models become increasingly accessible, maintaining assessment integrity is a pressing concern for educational institutions worldwide. The significance of this work is substantial for several reasons: (1) it directly addresses a major challenge identified in the workshop call - ensuring AI accountability in educational assessments, (2) the proposed framework could significantly improve detection capabilities across diverse subjects and question types, addressing a key limitation of current tools, (3) the explainability component increases transparency and trust, which is crucial for adoption in high-stakes educational settings, (4) the open-source API and integration guidelines facilitate practical implementation, extending impact beyond research, and (5) the fairness evaluations promote equitable AI detection practices. The potential impact extends beyond just detection to enabling responsible AI adoption in education more broadly, as explicitly stated in the expected impact section."
