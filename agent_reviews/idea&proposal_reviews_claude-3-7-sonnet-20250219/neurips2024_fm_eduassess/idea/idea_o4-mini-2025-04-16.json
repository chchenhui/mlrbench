        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on large foundation models for educational assessment. It specifically addresses automated scoring using LLMs, which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest. The proposal directly tackles the explainability challenge mentioned in the task description ('the explainability and accountability of current large foundations models are still inadequate to convince the stakeholders in the educational ecosystem'). The two-phase framework incorporating chain-of-thought prompting and saliency attribution is designed precisely to address the transparency concerns that limit adoption in educational assessments. The proposal also mentions evaluation through educator feedback loops, which aligns with the workshop's goal of bringing together AI and educational assessment researchers."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The two-phase framework is well-articulated with specific techniques (CoT prompting and saliency attribution) clearly defined. The expected outputs are explicitly stated: (a) numeric score, (b) human-readable rationale, and (c) highlighted evidence in student text. The motivation is concisely explained, establishing the problem context effectively. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as the specific rubric dimensions to be used, the exact feature-attribution implementation details, and how the saliency attribution will be mapped back to the original text. The evaluation methodology is mentioned but could be more detailed regarding metrics and comparison baselines."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in combining two established techniques (chain-of-thought prompting and saliency attribution) in a novel way specifically for educational assessment. While both CoT prompting and feature attribution methods like Integrated Gradients exist separately, their integration for explainable automated essay scoring represents a fresh approach. The focus on mapping the model's reasoning to specific rubric criteria and highlighting relevant evidence in student text adds innovative elements. However, both core techniques are established in the literature, and explainable AI for education has been explored before, though perhaps not with this specific combination of methods. The approach builds upon existing work rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or paradigms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and resources. Chain-of-thought prompting is well-established with foundation models, and feature attribution techniques like Integrated Gradients have mature implementations. Public essay datasets are available for evaluation. The two-phase approach is modular and can be implemented incrementally. The main technical challenges would be in fine-tuning the foundation model effectively for the educational domain and ensuring the saliency attribution correctly identifies relevant parts of the student text. Educator feedback loops might require significant coordination but are certainly achievable. The proposal doesn't require novel theoretical breakthroughs or unavailable data, making it quite practical to implement with existing methods and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in educational technology: the lack of transparency and explainability in AI-based assessment systems. The significance is high because automated essay scoring has substantial real-world impact on students' educational outcomes, and current black-box approaches limit trust and adoption. By providing transparent, rubric-aligned explanations alongside scores, this work could significantly advance the practical application of AI in high-stakes educational contexts. The potential impact extends beyond technical improvements to address social and ethical dimensions of AI in education, including fairness and accountability. If successful, this approach could become a standard for trustworthy AI-driven assessments, benefiting millions of students and educators while setting new standards for explainable AI in education."
