        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on large foundation models for educational assessment. It directly addresses one of the key challenges mentioned in the task description: 'the explainability and accountability of current large foundations models are still inadequate to convince the stakeholders in the educational ecosystem.' The proposal specifically targets explainability and accountability frameworks, which are explicitly listed as topics of interest ('Trustworthy AI (Fairness, Explainability, Privacy) for educational assessment'). The idea also connects to automated scoring and item generation, which are other topics mentioned in the workshop description."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure that outlines the motivation, main idea, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-step approach (explainability techniques, accountability frameworks, and evaluation) provides a logical progression for the research. The specific XAI methods (LIME, SHAP, LRP) are clearly identified. However, there could be more detail on how these methods would be specifically adapted for educational contexts, and the exact educational assessment tasks that would be targeted could be more precisely defined. The proposal is clear enough to understand the general direction but would benefit from more specificity in implementation details."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing XAI techniques (LIME, SHAP, LRP) with educational assessment applications, which represents an important application area but not a fundamentally new approach. The novelty lies in the specific application domain rather than in developing new explainability methods. The accountability framework that incorporates fairness metrics and privacy-preserving techniques shows some innovation in bringing together multiple aspects of trustworthy AI for education. However, the proposal doesn't clearly articulate how these approaches would be adapted or extended beyond their current capabilities to address the unique challenges of educational assessment. The integration of these techniques in a comprehensive framework for educational assessment has value, but the technical novelty is moderate."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed research leverages established XAI techniques and accountability frameworks, making it technically feasible. The three-step methodology provides a practical roadmap for implementation. Applying LIME, SHAP, and LRP to foundation models is well-documented in the literature, though applying them effectively to large foundation models may present computational challenges. The collaboration with educational practitioners for evaluation is a strength that enhances feasibility through real-world validation. However, the proposal doesn't address potential challenges in accessing appropriate educational datasets or the computational resources needed for working with large foundation models. Additionally, ensuring that the explainability techniques actually meet the needs of educational stakeholders may be more complex than anticipated, as different stakeholders (students, teachers, administrators) may have different explainability requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical barrier to the adoption of AI in educational assessment: the lack of explainability and accountability. As noted in the task description, these limitations currently prevent wider adoption of foundation models in educational contexts. By developing methods to enhance transparency and reliability, the research could significantly impact how AI is integrated into educational systems. The potential benefits include more efficient, effective, and equitable educational practices, which could have far-reaching societal impacts. The focus on fairness and privacy also addresses important ethical considerations in AI-based educational assessment. The significance is high because improved explainability could bridge the gap between technical capabilities and practical implementation in educational settings, potentially transforming assessment practices."
