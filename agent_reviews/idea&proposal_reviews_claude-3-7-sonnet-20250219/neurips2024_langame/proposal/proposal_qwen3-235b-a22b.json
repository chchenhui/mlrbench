    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on Language Gamification by implementing Wittgenstein's concept of language games through an adversarial setup between Planner and Skeptic agents. The proposal incorporates deep reinforcement learning for interactive LLM finetuning as specified in the task description. It faithfully expands on the research idea of 'Planning via Persuasion' by detailing the adversarial game structure, reward mechanisms, and expected outcomes. The literature review is well-integrated, with the methodology building upon concepts from papers on reinforcement learning, planning, and adversarial training. The only minor inconsistency is that some of the cited papers in the literature review (particularly the fictional ones with authors like 'Jane Doe') aren't explicitly referenced in the proposal, though their concepts are implicitly incorporated."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented with appropriate technical detail, including mathematical formulations of the reward structure and policy learning objectives. The adversarial language game framework is thoroughly explained with a clear delineation of the roles of the Planner and Skeptic agents. The experimental design section provides comprehensive information about datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific mechanisms for determining when the Skeptic 'approves' a plan could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the task success reward and the actual verification of plan success could be elaborated, and (3) some technical details about how the dialogue history is encoded into state representations could be more explicit."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The adversarial 'Persuasion Game' framework for improving planning capabilities in LLMs is a fresh approach that extends beyond standard reinforcement learning or imitation learning paradigms. The integration of Wittgensteinian philosophy with computational models provides a unique theoretical grounding. However, the core techniques (PPO, multi-agent RL, adversarial training) are well-established in the literature. The proposal builds incrementally on existing work rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks. While the application to planning via persuasion is innovative, similar adversarial setups have been explored in other contexts, as indicated in the literature review (e.g., papers on adversarial training and multi-agent RL for language games)."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The reinforcement learning framework is well-formulated with clear mathematical definitions of the policy learning objective, reward structure, and advantage estimation. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The ablation studies are thoughtfully designed to isolate the effects of different components. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations (training instability, computational cost, evaluation bias) and offers reasonable mitigation strategies. The theoretical grounding in Wittgenstein's language games provides a solid philosophical foundation. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal could provide more detail on how the Skeptic agent is trained or designed to be an effective adversary, (2) the relationship between persuasion success and actual plan quality could be more rigorously established, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more explicit connections to formal game theory."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components, though it faces some implementation challenges. The core technologies (LLMs, PPO, multi-agent RL) are established and accessible. The datasets mentioned (ALFWorld, GSM8K, StrategyQA, MuTual) are publicly available. The proposal acknowledges computational constraints and suggests parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA to address them. However, several practical challenges exist: (1) training two LLM agents in an adversarial setting with RL is computationally expensive and potentially unstable, (2) designing an effective reward function that balances task success, persuasion, and efficiency may require significant tuning, (3) evaluating dialogue quality and persuasion success introduces subjectivity that could complicate assessment, and (4) the proposal mentions distributed training but doesn't detail the infrastructure requirements. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do increase its complexity and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant limitation in current LLMs—their restricted planning and reasoning abilities—which has broad implications across multiple domains. If successful, the research could substantially advance interactive training paradigms for language models, potentially improving their performance in complex reasoning tasks. The expected 15% improvement in Task Success Rate would represent a meaningful advance in the field. The proposal identifies several high-impact application areas (education, scientific discovery, ethical alignment) where improved planning capabilities would be valuable. The theoretical contribution of formalizing adversarial language games bridges philosophy and computational linguistics in a novel way. The work directly addresses the workshop's focus on Language Gamification and could influence future research on interactive training methods. While the immediate practical applications might be limited by computational requirements, the conceptual framework and empirical findings could significantly influence how future language models are trained and evaluated."
