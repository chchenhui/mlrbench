    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the concept of Language Gamification through the Persuasion Game framework, which embodies Wittgenstein's language games theory by creating an interactive environment where language acquires meaning through use. The proposal incorporates multi-agent learning, reinforcement learning, and planning capabilities as mentioned in the workshop topics. The adversarial setup between Planner and Skeptic agents perfectly matches the research idea of 'Planning via Persuasion' using DRL in adversarial language games. The methodology also builds upon several papers mentioned in the literature review, particularly those related to reinforcement learning, planning capabilities in LLMs, and adversarial training approaches. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions human feedback integration as a challenge, the proposal primarily focuses on agent-to-agent interaction with limited human involvement (only in one experimental condition)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The Persuasion Game framework is explained in detail, including the roles of the Planner and Skeptic, the turn-based protocol, and the evaluation criteria. The reinforcement learning approach is presented with formal mathematical notation for state space, action space, and reward functions, making the technical aspects precise and understandable. The experimental design is comprehensive, with five distinct experiments addressing different aspects of the research. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of how the reward models will be trained could be more specific, (2) some parameters in the reward functions (α, β, γ, etc.) are introduced without specifying their values or how they will be determined, and (3) the transition from supervised fine-tuning to the MARL training loop could be explained more explicitly."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach to enhancing planning capabilities in LLMs through adversarial language games. While individual components like reinforcement learning from human feedback and multi-agent training have been explored in the literature, the specific formulation of the Persuasion Game as a structured adversarial dialogue between Planner and Skeptic agents represents a novel contribution. The reward functions designed specifically for planning and persuasion tasks are original and well-thought-out. The integration of Wittgenstein's language games theory with modern deep reinforcement learning techniques creates a fresh perspective on LLM training. The proposal also innovatively addresses the limitations of static training data by creating a dynamic, interactive environment. However, it builds upon existing techniques like PPO and RLHF rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms, which slightly limits its novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations, drawing appropriately from language philosophy, cognitive science, and reinforcement learning. The methodology is generally rigorous, with well-defined state spaces, action spaces, and reward functions. The experimental design is comprehensive, including comparative evaluations, ablation studies, and human evaluations. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The reward functions, while well-conceived, may face challenges in implementation, particularly in determining what constitutes a 'valid' critique or a 'genuine' flaw without perfect ground truth; (2) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address the computational complexity of training two LLMs simultaneously with RL; (3) There's limited discussion of potential failure modes or theoretical limitations of the approach; (4) The curriculum learning approach is mentioned but not detailed sufficiently. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is sound and the technical formulations are correct, with appropriate citations to established methods like PPO."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially implementable research agenda. On the positive side, it builds on established techniques like PPO and supervised fine-tuning, and the experimental design is logical and well-structured. The data preparation plan is reasonable, with clear domain specifications and evaluation criteria. However, several significant feasibility challenges exist: (1) The computational resources required to train two LLM agents with reinforcement learning would be substantial, potentially limiting full implementation; (2) Creating reliable reward models that can accurately evaluate plan quality and persuasiveness is extremely difficult and may require extensive human annotation; (3) The proposal requires creating 4,000+ planning problems with ground-truth evaluations across diverse domains, which represents a significant data creation burden; (4) The action space of 'all possible text utterances' is enormous, and constraining it effectively while maintaining expressiveness will be challenging. The authors acknowledge some of these limitations in section 3.3, but don't fully address how they'll overcome them within the scope of the proposed research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental limitation in current LLM training paradigms - the lack of interactive learning for developing planning and reasoning capabilities. If successful, this research could significantly advance both theoretical understanding and practical applications of LLMs. The theoretical contributions align perfectly with the workshop's focus on Language Gamification and could provide empirical evidence for Wittgenstein's language games concept in AI development. The practical applications are far-reaching, including enhanced planning assistants, more robust conversational agents, and improved reasoning capabilities across domains. The expected outcomes include not just improved planning capabilities (20% increase in success rates) and logical coherence (30% reduction in contradictions), but also a reusable framework for training LLMs through structured language games that could benefit the broader research community. The proposal also addresses a critical gap in current LLM capabilities that has significant implications for their deployment in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning and planning."
