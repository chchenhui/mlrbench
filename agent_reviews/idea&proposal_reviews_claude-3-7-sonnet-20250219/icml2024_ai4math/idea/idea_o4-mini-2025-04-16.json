        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on autoformalization, auto-informalization, and theorem generation. It directly addresses the first bullet point about 'autoformalization and the reversed auto-informalization' by proposing a dual-Transformer framework that handles both directions. It also tackles 'automated theorem generation' by incorporating a mechanism to generate new theorems. The cycle-consistency approach addresses the measurement aspect mentioned in the workshop topics. The idea of leveraging formal libraries to expand training data is consistent with the workshop's interest in improving mathematical reasoning capabilities in AI systems. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address formal verification aspects, though the autoformalization component is closely related."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure explaining the motivation, approach, and expected outcomes. The dual-Transformer framework is well-defined with specific tasks: autoformalizing informal proof sketches and generating natural-language descriptions for formal theorems. The cycle-consistency mechanism and self-critical learning objective are mentioned, though they could benefit from slightly more technical elaboration. The proposal specifies concrete proof assistant languages (Lean/Coq) and outlines a clear methodology for generating training data. While the overall approach is clear, some implementation details about how the 'slight perturbation' of formal theorems would work and how the self-critical learning objective would be formulated could be more precisely defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents significant innovation in several aspects. The cycle-consistency approach to autoformalization is relatively unexplored, especially when combined with theorem generation. Using perturbed formal theorems to generate new training data addresses the critical issue of scarce parallel corpora in autoformalization, which is an innovative solution. The bidirectional nature of the framework (formal-to-informal and informal-to-formal) is not entirely new, but the integration with theorem generation and the self-supervised learning approach represents a fresh perspective. The retrieval of similar lemmas to augment context is also a clever addition. While some individual components may exist in prior work, their combination and application to autoformalization represents a novel contribution to the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but faces some implementation challenges. The Transformer architecture is well-established, and both autoformalization and theorem generation have existing baselines to build upon. Access to formal libraries in Lean/Coq is available. However, several practical challenges exist: (1) Ensuring that perturbed theorems remain mathematically valid is non-trivial; (2) The cycle-consistency loss may be difficult to optimize effectively given the discrete nature of formal languages; (3) Evaluating the correctness of generated theorems requires sophisticated verification mechanisms. The proposal doesn't fully address how these challenges would be overcome. The computational resources required for training dual Transformer models might also be substantial. Despite these challenges, the core approach appears implementable with current technology and expertise in the field."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI for mathematics: the scarcity of parallel data for autoformalization and the brittleness of current approaches. If successful, it could significantly advance the field by: (1) Creating larger and higher-quality training datasets for autoformalization; (2) Improving the accuracy and robustness of autoformalization systems; (3) Enabling the discovery of new mathematical conjectures through AI; (4) Lowering barriers to formalizing mathematics, which has implications for verification and theorem proving. The potential impact extends beyond autoformalization to collaborative human-AI mathematical discovery, which aligns with the workshop's vision. The approach could also generalize to other formal domains beyond mathematics, such as program synthesis and verification. The significance is high because it tackles fundamental limitations in current approaches to mathematical AI."
