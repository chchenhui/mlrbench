        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Autoformalization' focus area mentioned in the workshop summary. The proposal directly tackles the challenge of improving 'the precision of the autoformalization process from natural language proof to formal proof' which is explicitly mentioned as a key area of interest. The multi-modal approach combining NLP with symbolic reasoning is highly relevant to the workshop's goals of advancing AI for mathematical reasoning. The idea also touches on automated theorem proving by addressing intermediate step errors through improved formalization precision."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a well-structured methodology with five clear steps: data collection, preprocessing, symbolic integration, neural network training, and evaluation/refinement. The motivation and expected outcomes are articulated concisely. However, some minor ambiguities exist - for instance, the exact mechanisms of the 'symbolic reasoning module' could be further elaborated, and the specific techniques for back-translation and active learning in the refinement phase could be more precisely defined. Despite these minor points, the overall approach is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to combining multi-modal learning with symbolic reasoning for autoformalization. While neural-symbolic approaches exist in the field, the specific application to autoformalization with the integration of back-translation and active learning for refinement offers fresh perspectives. The approach isn't entirely groundbreaking as it builds upon existing techniques in NLP and symbolic reasoning, but it combines these in a potentially innovative way. The multi-modal aspect particularly stands out as a novel direction for addressing the precision challenges in autoformalization."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The data collection, preprocessing using NLP techniques, and neural network training are all well-established practices. The symbolic reasoning integration presents moderate challenges but is achievable with existing techniques. The continuous evaluation and refinement using back-translation and active learning is a practical approach. The main implementation challenges would likely come from creating a sufficiently diverse and high-quality dataset of natural language proofs paired with formal proofs, and effectively integrating the symbolic reasoning with neural approaches. These challenges are significant but surmountable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant problem in AI for mathematics. Improving autoformalization precision has far-reaching implications for automated theorem proving, formal verification, and human-AI collaboration in mathematical reasoning. The potential impact extends to code generation, educational applications, and scientific discovery, aligning well with the workshop's broader scope. The significance is particularly high because autoformalization serves as a foundational capability that can enable progress in many of the other areas mentioned in the workshop description. By bridging the gap between natural language and formal representations, this research could substantially advance the field of AI for Math."
