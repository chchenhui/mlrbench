    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Automated theorem generation' focus area mentioned in the workshop summary, while incorporating elements of formal verification. The proposal faithfully expands on the main idea of creating a neural-symbolic framework enhanced by reinforcement learning, maintaining consistency with the original motivation and expected outcomes. The methodology leverages relevant prior work cited in the literature review, particularly building upon approaches from FGeo-DRL, QEDCartographer, and TacticZero. The proposal acknowledges and addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as ensuring logical validity, balancing creativity with correctness, and integrating symbolic and neural methods. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions knowledge graphs for theorem proving, the proposal could have more explicitly connected its knowledge graph component to those specific works."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The system architecture is clearly broken down into three core components (Neural Generator, RL Agent, and Symbolic Knowledge Graph), and the algorithmic steps are presented in a logical sequence with formal notation. The experimental design, including baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics, is well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for integrating the knowledge graph into the theorem generation process could be more precisely defined; (2) The 'Utility(t)' component of the reward function is somewhat vaguely described as 'usage frequency in subsequent proofs'; and (3) The proposal could more clearly articulate how the symbolic constraints will be implemented and enforced during generation. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing approaches in a new way. The integration of transformer-based generation, RL-driven validation with ATP rewards, and a knowledge graph for guiding novelty represents a fresh synthesis not fully explored in the cited literature. The reward mechanism that balances correctness, novelty, and applicability is particularly innovative. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing work: transformer models for theorem generation (Johnson & Lee, 2023), RL for theorem proving (FGeo-DRL, QEDCartographer, TacticZero), and knowledge graphs for mathematical reasoning (Black & Grey, 2024). While the proposal creates a novel combination of these elements, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks. The approach is more evolutionary than revolutionary, building incrementally on established techniques rather than proposing entirely new paradigms for theorem generation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The approach is grounded in established machine learning techniques (transformers, PPO for RL) and formal verification methods (ATPs). The mathematical formulations for pre-training, candidate generation, validation, and policy optimization are correctly presented and appropriate for the task. The reward function is well-designed to balance multiple objectives (correctness, novelty, and utility). The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics, with ablation studies to assess component contributions. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations. However, there are a few areas where additional rigor would strengthen the approach: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the potentially large search space of theorem candidates; (2) There's limited discussion of how to ensure diversity in the generated theorems beyond the similarity metric; and (3) The proposal could benefit from more detailed statistical analysis plans for evaluating results. Despite these minor limitations, the overall technical approach is sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant computational resources and expertise. The use of established frameworks (transformers, RL, ATPs) increases feasibility, and the modular design allows for incremental development and testing. The datasets mentioned (Formalgeo7K, CoqGym) are publicly available, and the evaluation metrics are measurable. However, several implementation challenges exist: (1) Integrating neural models with formal theorem provers is technically complex and may require substantial engineering effort; (2) The reward function relies on ATP verification, which can be computationally expensive and may create bottlenecks during training; (3) Building a comprehensive knowledge graph of mathematical concepts is labor-intensive and may require domain expertise; and (4) The expected outcomes (>90% validity, 30% higher novelty) are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve in practice. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal infeasible—rather, they suggest that the timeline and resources required may be substantial, and some technical compromises might be necessary during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in AI for mathematics with potentially high impact. Automated theorem generation that balances novelty with formal validity could significantly advance collaborative mathematics, as highlighted in the workshop summary. The potential applications span mathematical research, AI collaboration, education, and formal verification—all areas emphasized in the task description. If successful, the system could accelerate mathematical discovery by generating high-quality hypotheses for exploration, reducing the time between conjecture and proof. The broader impact section convincingly argues for the significance of the work across multiple domains. The proposal also contributes methodologically by demonstrating how hybrid neural-symbolic systems can leverage both the creativity of neural networks and the rigor of symbolic logic. However, the actual impact will depend on how well the system performs in practice and whether it can generate theorems that are not just formally valid but also mathematically interesting and useful—a subjective criterion that's harder to guarantee. Nevertheless, the potential significance is substantial, aligning well with the workshop's goal of applying AI technologies to mathematics for meaningful discoveries."
