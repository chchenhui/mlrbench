    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Automated theorem generation' focus area from the workshop summary, aiming to create a system that generates valid and novel theorems. The proposal faithfully expands on the provided research idea, developing a neural-symbolic framework with reinforcement learning as outlined. It incorporates knowledge from the literature review, specifically referencing techniques from papers like QEDCartographer (Sanchez-Stern et al. 2024) and building on neural-symbolic methods (Green & White 2024). The methodology addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as ensuring logical validity, balancing creativity with correctness, and integrating symbolic and neural methods. The proposal's use of formal mathematics corpora (Lean, Coq, Mizar) and automated theorem provers for validation is consistent with approaches mentioned in the literature."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the approach, including specific algorithms, mathematical formulations, and evaluation metrics. The neural policy architecture, reinforcement learning formulation, and reward design are all precisely defined with appropriate mathematical notation. The experimental design outlines clear baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) The exact mechanism for integrating the symbolic constraints via the context-free grammar could be more detailed, (2) The process for determining when to apply symbolic refinement based on 'systematic violations' is somewhat vague, and (3) The specific implementation details of the ATP feedback loop could be more thoroughly explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The integration of a knowledge graph with a transformer-based neural policy for theorem generation is innovative, as is the composite reward function that balances validity, novelty, and complexity. The use of grammar constraints combined with ATP feedback in a reinforcement learning loop represents a fresh approach to ensuring both creativity and correctness in theorem generation. However, the core components (transformers, GNNs, PPO, ATP verification) are established techniques, and similar neural-symbolic approaches with RL have been explored in related contexts as noted in the literature review. The proposal builds incrementally on existing work rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. While the specific combination and application to theorem generation is novel, the individual components and general approach follow established patterns in the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established techniques from deep learning, reinforcement learning, and automated theorem proving. The MDP formulation is appropriate, and the PPO algorithm is a solid choice for policy optimization. The reward function design thoughtfully addresses the key challenges of validity, novelty, and complexity. The use of symbolic constraints via a context-free grammar is theoretically sound for ensuring well-formed outputs. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including both automated metrics and human assessment. The statistical analysis plan is appropriate. However, there are a few minor concerns: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the sparse reward problem that often plagues RL in theorem proving, (2) The similarity measure for novelty assessment could be more rigorously defined, and (3) The balance between exploration and exploitation in the RL framework could be more thoroughly justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The data sources (Lean, Coq, Mizar) are publicly available, and the proposed transformer and GNN architectures are implementable with current deep learning frameworks. The integration with automated theorem provers is practical, as these tools exist and have APIs. However, several aspects may require significant effort: (1) Constructing a comprehensive knowledge graph from formal mathematics corpora is labor-intensive and may require domain expertise, (2) The computational resources needed for training both the transformer model and the RL policy could be substantial, (3) The ATP verification step in the reward function may create a computational bottleneck during training, as theorem proving can be time-consuming, and (4) The evaluation by mathematicians requires recruiting domain experts, which may be challenging. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that would need careful management."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in AI for mathematics with potentially high impact. Successful implementation of NSThGen would represent a significant advancement in automated theorem generation, potentially accelerating mathematical discovery by providing researchers with high-quality conjectures. The system could serve as a valuable tool for human-AI collaboration in mathematics, addressing a core goal mentioned in the workshop summary. The methodological contributions regarding the integration of neural, symbolic, and reinforcement learning approaches have broader implications for other domains requiring structured generation under validity constraints. The proposal also contributes to the development of evaluation metrics for theorem novelty and utility, addressing another challenge in the field. The expected outcomes are ambitious but realistic, and the potential applications in education and formal verification extend the impact beyond pure mathematics. The open-source commitment further enhances the significance by enabling broader community engagement and extension."
