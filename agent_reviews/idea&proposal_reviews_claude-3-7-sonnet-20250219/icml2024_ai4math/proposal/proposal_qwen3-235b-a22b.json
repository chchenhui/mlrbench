    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Automated theorem generation' focus area mentioned in the workshop summary, proposing a neural-symbolic framework enhanced by reinforcement learning to generate formally valid theorems. The methodology incorporates automated theorem provers (ATPs) as reward signals, knowledge graphs for novelty steering, and evaluation metrics for logical validity, originality, and applicability—all consistent with the original idea. The proposal extensively references and builds upon the literature review, citing works like TRAIL (Crouse et al., 2019), TacticZero (Wu et al., 2021), and QEDCartographer (Sanchez-Stern et al., 2024) to inform its reinforcement learning approach. It also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as ensuring logical validity, balancing creativity with correctness, and integrating symbolic and neural methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-articulated and structured logically across its sections. The introduction clearly establishes the problem context and research objectives. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the neural-symbolic framework, reinforcement learning integration, and evaluation metrics. The technical approach is described with sufficient detail, including the MDP formulation, reward function design, and curriculum learning strategy. Mathematical formulations are presented clearly, such as the reward function equation. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, particularly regarding the specific implementation details of the symbolic constraint layer and how exactly the knowledge graph will guide theorem generation. Additionally, while the proposal mentions using transformer-based models, it doesn't specify architectural details or hyperparameter considerations that would be important for implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining neural-symbolic methods with reinforcement learning specifically for theorem generation rather than theorem proving. While individual components (transformers, ATP validation, knowledge graphs) have been explored in prior work, their integration into a cohesive framework for generating novel theorems represents a fresh approach. The use of ATP as a reward signal in the RL framework is particularly innovative, as is the knowledge graph-driven exploration strategy to encourage novelty. However, the proposal shares similarities with existing approaches in the literature, particularly those mentioned in the review like the work by Green and White (2024) on neural-symbolic methods for automated theorem generation. The dual-reward mechanism that balances validity and originality is a notable contribution, but the overall approach builds incrementally on existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates a strong theoretical foundation. The MDP formulation for theorem generation is well-justified, with clearly defined states, actions, and rewards. The integration of symbolic constraints with neural generation is theoretically well-grounded, ensuring type-theoretic consistency during the generation process. The reward function is properly formulated to balance multiple objectives (validity, originality, applicability). The methodology draws appropriately from established techniques in reinforcement learning (PPO, A3C) and curriculum learning strategies similar to QEDCartographer. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and well-defined, including both quantitative measures (ATP validation, cosine similarity) and qualitative human assessment. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to validate component contributions. One minor weakness is that while the proposal mentions using cosine similarity for measuring theorem novelty, it doesn't fully address potential limitations of embedding-based similarity for mathematical statements where semantic equivalence might not be captured by syntactic similarity."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with some implementation challenges. The data sources (Lean's mathlib, Coq libraries) are readily available, and the transformer-based architecture can be implemented using existing frameworks. The integration with ATPs for validation is practical, as these systems are well-established. The curriculum learning strategy addresses the sparse reward problem in RL, making training more manageable. However, several aspects present feasibility challenges: (1) The computational resources required for training RL agents on complex mathematical domains could be substantial; (2) The symbolic constraint layer that enforces type-theoretic consistency during generation may be complex to implement effectively; (3) The knowledge graph construction for mathematical concepts requires significant domain expertise; and (4) The evaluation by expert mathematicians introduces logistical challenges. While these challenges don't render the proposal impractical, they do require careful consideration and potentially significant resources to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in AI for mathematics—generating novel, valid theorems that can contribute to mathematical discovery. If successful, this research would significantly advance human-AI collaboration in mathematics by enabling automated hypothesis generation that maintains formal rigor. The potential applications span multiple domains, including education (generating structured theorem challenges), formal verification (ensuring mathematical guarantees in software), and scientific research (generating new mathematical principles for domain-specific models). The proposal directly addresses a gap in current research, where theorem generation has received less attention than theorem proving. The expected outcomes include not only a functional system but also theoretical insights into balancing creativity with correctness in mathematical reasoning. The impact extends beyond mathematics to areas like program synthesis and formal verification, aligning with the workshop's broader scope. While the proposal has clear significance, its transformative potential depends on achieving the ambitious goal of generating truly novel and useful theorems, which remains challenging."
