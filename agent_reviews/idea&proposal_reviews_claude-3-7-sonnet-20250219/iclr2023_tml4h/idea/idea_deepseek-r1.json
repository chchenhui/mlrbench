        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description for the Trustworthy Machine Learning for Healthcare Workshop. It directly addresses multiple key topics mentioned in the scope, including multi-modal fusion of medical data (CT, MRI, EHRs), uncertainty estimation through Bayesian neural networks, explainability via attention maps, and robustness to out-of-distribution samples through the dynamic reliability estimation. The proposal specifically targets the trustworthiness gap that prevents ML adoption in healthcare settings, which is the central theme of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other topics like fairness or privacy, but this is reasonable given the focused nature of the proposal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (unreliable multi-modal fusion), the proposed solution (dynamic modality reliability estimation), the technical approach (Bayesian neural networks with attention mechanisms and self-supervised learning), and expected outcomes. The methodology is well-structured with a logical flow from problem to solution. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific implementation details of the Bayesian uncertainty quantification and how exactly the self-supervised auxiliary task would be designed and integrated, which would benefit from further elaboration. However, these are reasonable limitations given the concise format of the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to multi-modal medical fusion. While Bayesian neural networks, attention mechanisms, and multi-modal fusion are established techniques individually, their combination for dynamic reliability estimation in medical contexts represents a fresh perspective. The self-supervised auxiliary task for predicting modality corruption is particularly innovative. However, the core components build upon existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. Similar approaches to uncertainty-aware fusion exist in other domains, though perhaps not with this specific application to medical data reliability. The proposal offers a novel combination and application rather than groundbreaking new techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Bayesian neural networks, attention mechanisms, and multi-modal fusion are all established techniques with available implementations. The proposed self-supervised learning approach is reasonable and implementable. Medical datasets with multiple modalities (CT, MRI, EHRs) are available for research, and creating synthetic corruptions for training is straightforward. The main implementation challenges would be in tuning the Bayesian networks for proper uncertainty estimation and ensuring the attention mechanism correctly incorporates reliability signals, but these are manageable challenges rather than fundamental barriers. The computational requirements seem reasonable for modern research infrastructure."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is very high for healthcare ML applications. Trust is a critical barrier to clinical adoption of ML systems, and addressing modality reliability directly targets this issue. The ability to dynamically assess the reliability of different data sources during inference could substantially improve robustness in real-world clinical settings where data quality varies. The interpretability component through attention maps addresses the black-box nature of many ML systems, which is another major concern for clinicians. If successful, this approach could meaningfully advance trustworthy ML in healthcare by providing more reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions that clinicians can better understand and trust, potentially accelerating the adoption of ML in clinical practice."
