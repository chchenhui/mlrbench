        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Privacy-preserving ML for medical data' topic explicitly mentioned in the workshop scope. The proposal recognizes the challenges of applying ML in healthcare settings due to privacy concerns and regulatory constraints (like HIPAA), which is central to the workshop's focus on trustworthiness in healthcare ML. The federated learning approach with differential privacy and homomorphic encryption specifically targets the gap between ML capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, which is the core problem the workshop aims to address."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (privacy constraints in healthcare data sharing), proposes a specific solution (federated learning with differential privacy and homomorphic encryption), and outlines the expected benefits (collaborative model development without compromising privacy). The technical components are identified with sufficient detail - secure aggregation, adaptive noise injection, and mechanisms for handling class imbalance. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how the 'clinical significance thresholds' would be determined and how exactly the system would handle institution-specific data distributions."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining several existing techniques (federated learning, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption) in a novel way specifically tailored for healthcare applications. The innovation of 'adaptive noise injection calibrated to clinical significance thresholds' appears to be a fresh approach to balancing privacy and utility in the medical context. However, federated learning with privacy guarantees has been explored before in healthcare, and the core technologies mentioned are established. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and healthcare-specific adaptations rather than introducing fundamentally new methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Federated learning and differential privacy are mature enough for implementation, but homomorphic encryption remains computationally expensive and may introduce latency issues in a distributed healthcare setting. The challenge of handling institution-specific data distributions and class imbalance in a privacy-preserving manner is substantial. Additionally, getting multiple healthcare institutions to adopt a common framework requires addressing organizational, technical, and regulatory hurdles. While the core components exist, integrating them into a practical system that meets both privacy requirements and maintains clinical utility will require considerable engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical barrier to ML adoption in healthcare: the inability to share sensitive patient data across institutions. If successful, it could enable unprecedented collaboration among healthcare organizations, particularly valuable for rare diseases or diverse populations where single-institution data is insufficient. The potential impact extends beyond technical advancement to potentially improving patient outcomes through better diagnostic and treatment models. The approach directly addresses regulatory compliance concerns that currently limit ML deployment in healthcare. By enabling privacy-preserving collaboration, this research could significantly accelerate the development and deployment of ML in clinical settings."
