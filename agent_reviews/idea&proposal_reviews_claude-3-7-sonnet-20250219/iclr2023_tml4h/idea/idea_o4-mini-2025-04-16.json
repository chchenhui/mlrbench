        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on trustworthy machine learning for healthcare. It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the scope: uncertainty estimation, human-in-the-loop approaches, active learning in healthcare, and multi-modal learning (MRI/CT scans). The proposal specifically targets improving model calibration and clinician trust, which are central to the workshop's goal of enhancing the trustworthiness of ML in healthcare settings. The only minor limitation is that while it touches on explainability indirectly through uncertainty visualization, it could more explicitly address the explainability aspect mentioned in the workshop scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured with clear components: the Bayesian uncertainty-driven framework, the active learning approach, the interactive interface for clinicians, and the validation methodology. The proposal specifies concrete evaluation metrics (Dice score, Expected Calibration Error, annotation time) and target applications (brain tumor segmentation, pulmonary nodule detection). While the overall approach is clear, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific Bayesian model architecture to be used, how the incremental model updates will be implemented, and the exact mechanism for integrating clinician feedback into the model training process."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines several existing concepts (Bayesian uncertainty estimation, active learning, human-in-the-loop annotation) in a thoughtful way that is tailored to the medical imaging domain. The integration of predictive entropy and mutual information for sample selection in a clinical context is a valuable contribution. However, each of these individual components has been explored in prior work, and similar approaches have been applied in medical imaging before. The novelty lies primarily in the specific combination of techniques and the focus on both improving model performance and building clinician trust simultaneously, rather than in introducing fundamentally new algorithms or frameworks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Bayesian neural networks, uncertainty estimation, and active learning frameworks are well-established techniques with available implementations. The medical imaging datasets mentioned (brain tumor and pulmonary nodule) are standard benchmarks with accessible data. The main implementation challenges would be developing an effective interactive interface for clinicians and securing sufficient clinical expertise for the annotation process. The computational requirements for Bayesian uncertainty estimation in large medical images might be demanding but are manageable with modern GPU resources. The incremental model updating strategy would need careful design to ensure efficiency, but overall, the technical components are realistic to implement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in healthcare ML adoption: the gap between technical performance and clinical trust. By focusing on both model accuracy and uncertainty calibration while actively involving clinicians, the approach could significantly impact how ML models are developed and integrated into clinical workflows. Well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are particularly valuable in high-stakes medical decisions, potentially preventing harmful misdiagnoses. The reduction in annotation burden addresses a practical limitation in medical AI development, while the focus on building clinician trust tackles a key barrier to adoption. If successful, this approach could serve as a template for developing trustworthy AI systems across various medical imaging applications, potentially accelerating clinical adoption of ML technologies."
