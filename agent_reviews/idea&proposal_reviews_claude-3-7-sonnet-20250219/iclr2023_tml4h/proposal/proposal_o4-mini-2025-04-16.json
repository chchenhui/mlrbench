    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on trustworthy ML for healthcare, particularly targeting uncertainty estimation, multi-modal fusion, and explainability. The proposal implements the core idea of dynamic modality reliability estimation using Bayesian neural networks and attention mechanisms as outlined in the research idea. It also builds upon and extends the literature review by incorporating Bayesian uncertainty quantification (from Gal & Ghahramani), addressing missing modalities (as in MDA and DrFuse), and implementing attention-based fusion (similar to DRIFA-Net). The methodology section comprehensively covers all aspects mentioned in the idea, including the self-supervised auxiliary task for corruption detection. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes modal inconsistency as a key challenge, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed this aspect beyond missing data and noise."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated with numbered points, and the methodology is presented in a logical, step-by-step manner with appropriate mathematical formulations. The architecture is well-defined with clear explanations of each component: Bayesian backbones, reliability estimation, attention-weighted fusion, and the auxiliary corruption detection task. The experimental design section provides comprehensive details on datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The expected outcomes are also clearly enumerated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the reliability scores r_m and the auxiliary corruption detection task could be more explicitly connected, (2) Some technical details about how the Bayesian neural networks are implemented beyond MC Dropout could be elaborated, and (3) The proposal could more clearly specify how the approach handles completely missing modalities versus corrupted ones."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing techniques in a novel way. The integration of Bayesian uncertainty estimation with attention-based fusion and a self-supervised auxiliary task for corruption detection represents a fresh approach not fully explored in the cited literature. The Auxiliary Corruption Detection (ACD) task is particularly innovative, as it explicitly trains the model to recognize and quantify modality degradation. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing work: Bayesian neural networks with MC Dropout from Gal & Ghahramani, attention-based fusion similar to MDA and DRIFA-Net, and handling missing modalities like DrFuse and HEALNet. While the proposal combines these elements in a novel architecture, it represents an incremental rather than transformative advance. The reliability weighting mechanism is similar to existing attention mechanisms, though with the novel application to uncertainty-based weighting."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The Bayesian neural network approach using MC Dropout is theoretically grounded in established literature (Gal & Ghahramani), and the mathematical formulations for uncertainty estimation and reliability weighting are correct and appropriate. The attention-weighted fusion mechanism is well-justified, and the auxiliary task provides a clever way to improve reliability estimation. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical validation plans. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address how the approach handles correlations between modalities, which could affect reliability estimation, (2) The choice of the exponential function for converting uncertainties to reliability scores could be better justified with alternatives discussed, and (3) The sensitivity parameter Î± is introduced without clear guidance on how to set it optimally."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The datasets mentioned (MIMIC-CXR, MIMIC-IV, TCGA) are publicly available, and the preprocessing steps are standard and achievable. The model architecture, while complex, builds on established techniques (Bayesian NNs, attention mechanisms) that have proven implementations. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and measurable. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) The computational cost of running multiple forward passes for MC Dropout across multiple modalities could be substantial, potentially requiring significant GPU resources, (2) The in-house multi-center cohort mentioned is subject to IRB approval, which introduces uncertainty, (3) The proposal doesn't fully address the potential challenges in hyperparameter tuning for such a complex model with multiple components (Bayesian backbones, attention mechanism, auxiliary task weighting), and (4) The implementation of corruption simulation across different modality types (images vs. EHR) may require careful design to ensure fair comparisons."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in clinical AI deployment: trustworthy multi-modal fusion that can handle real-world data imperfections. Its significance is high for several reasons: (1) It directly tackles the trust gap that has limited clinical adoption of AI systems, (2) The ability to dynamically assess modality reliability could significantly improve robustness in clinical settings where data quality varies, (3) The interpretability aspect through reliability weights provides transparency that clinicians need, and (4) The uncertainty quantification enables safer deployment by flagging low-confidence predictions. The expected outcomes align well with the needs of the healthcare domain, particularly the ability to maintain performance despite corrupted inputs and to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates. The promise to open-source code, models, and benchmarks further enhances the potential impact. However, the proposal could more explicitly address how the approach might generalize beyond the specific medical domains studied, and how it might integrate with existing clinical workflows to maximize real-world impact."
