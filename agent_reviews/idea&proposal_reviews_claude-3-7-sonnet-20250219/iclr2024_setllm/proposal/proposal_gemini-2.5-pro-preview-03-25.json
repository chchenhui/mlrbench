        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Reliability assurance and assessment of LLMs' and 'Fact verification (e.g. hallucinated generation)'. The core concept of proactive hallucination detection via internal confidence calibration perfectly matches the research idea. The methodology incorporates contrastive learning approaches as suggested in the original idea, and the proposal extensively references and builds upon the literature review, citing all provided papers and addressing the key challenges identified. The proposal thoroughly integrates insights from papers like InternalInspector, MIND, and PRISM, while proposing solutions to challenges like calibration and generalization mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and impact. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations and clear descriptions of the data collection, model architecture, training procedure, and evaluation metrics. The writing is professional and accessible. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for extracting and processing internal states could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between segment-level and token-level confidence scores during inference could be elaborated, and (3) some implementation details regarding the contrastive learning procedure could be more specific."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The core innovation lies in the integration of contrastive learning with internal state analysis specifically for hallucination detection, and the focus on proactive rather than post-hoc verification. While individual components like contrastive learning, internal state analysis, and confidence calibration have been explored in the cited literature (e.g., InternalInspector, MIND), the proposal's unique contribution is the comprehensive framework that combines these elements into a cohesive approach for real-time hallucination flagging. The proposal is not entirely groundbreaking as it builds heavily on existing methods, but it does offer a fresh perspective by focusing on training models to self-assess factuality during generation rather than relying on external verification or post-processing."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The contrastive learning approach is mathematically well-formulated with clear loss functions and training objectives. The data collection strategy is comprehensive, addressing both factual and hallucinated examples. The evaluation plan is rigorous, including multiple metrics and baselines for comparison. The proposal is grounded in established machine learning principles and builds logically on prior work in the field. The technical formulations for the contrastive loss and confidence prediction are correct and appropriate for the task. The experimental design includes appropriate controls and comparisons. One minor limitation is that while the proposal acknowledges potential challenges in generalizing across domains, it could provide more detailed strategies for addressing this issue beyond dataset diversity."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that could be implemented with current technology and resources. The use of publicly available pre-trained LLMs (Mistral-7B, Llama-2-13B) is practical, and the data collection strategy leverages existing datasets supplemented with generated examples. The contrastive fine-tuning approach is computationally intensive but manageable with modern GPU resources. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) extracting and processing internal states from LLMs at scale may be computationally expensive, (2) the quality of synthetically generated hallucinations might not fully represent real-world hallucination patterns, (3) fine-tuning large models with contrastive objectives may require significant computational resources, and (4) the human evaluation component, while valuable, would require careful planning and resources. Overall, the approach is implementable but would benefit from more discussion of computational requirements and potential optimization strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in LLM deployment - hallucination detection and mitigation - which has significant implications for trustworthiness and safety. If successful, the research could substantially improve the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains like medicine, finance, and education by enabling real-time hallucination flagging without external verification systems. The potential impact extends beyond academic contributions to practical applications in AI assistants, content generators, and information systems. The work directly addresses a major limitation of current LLMs that prevents their wider adoption in critical applications. The significance is well-articulated in relation to both scientific advancement (understanding internal representations) and practical utility (enhancing trustworthiness). The proposal also aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on secure and trustworthy LLMs, making it highly relevant to the intended audience."
