        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on secure and trustworthy LLMs. It directly addresses the 'fact verification (e.g. hallucinated generation)' topic explicitly mentioned in the workshop description, while also contributing to 'reliability assurance and assessment of LLMs.' The proposal aims to improve LLM trustworthiness by developing methods for proactive hallucination detection, which is a central concern of the workshop. The approach of internal confidence calibration is highly relevant to making LLMs more reliable and trustworthy in real-world applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (hallucinations in LLMs), proposes a specific solution approach (internal confidence calibration via contrastive learning), and outlines how this would work during inference. The methodology involving contrastive learning on factual vs. hallucinated content is well-explained. However, some minor ambiguities remain about the exact internal confidence metrics to be used (several possibilities are mentioned but not definitively selected) and how the thresholds would be determined. The implementation details could be more specific, but the core concept is presented with good clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows notable originality by focusing on proactive, self-monitoring approaches rather than post-hoc verification. While confidence calibration itself is not new in machine learning, applying it specifically to hallucination detection during generation represents a fresh perspective. The use of internal model states (entropy, activation patterns) as signals for hallucination detection is innovative. However, some aspects of the approach build upon existing work in confidence calibration and uncertainty estimation. The contrastive learning approach to distinguish between factual and hallucinated content is a clever application of an existing technique rather than a completely new methodology."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with current technology and methods. The contrastive learning approach is well-established, and accessing internal model states is possible with most modern LLM architectures. Creating datasets with paired factual/hallucinated content is challenging but achievable through existing techniques. Some implementation challenges exist: identifying which internal signals best correlate with hallucinations may require extensive experimentation, and the approach might need significant computational resources for fine-tuning large models. Additionally, the effectiveness may vary across different domains and types of factual knowledge, potentially requiring domain-specific calibration."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in LLM deployment - hallucinations that undermine trust and reliability. The significance is high because: 1) Hallucination detection is one of the most pressing challenges for practical LLM applications, especially in high-stakes domains; 2) The proactive approach could enable real-time reliability assessment without external verification tools, greatly expanding usability; 3) If successful, this could establish a new paradigm for self-monitoring LLMs that are inherently more trustworthy; 4) The approach could generalize to other forms of model uncertainty beyond factual accuracy. The potential impact on making LLMs more reliable for real-world applications is substantial."
