        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on secure and trustworthy LLMs. It directly addresses the 'fact verification' topic explicitly mentioned in the workshop's list of topics, specifically targeting hallucination reduction which is a critical trustworthiness challenge. The proposal also touches on interpretability (through linked evidence and confidence scores) and reliability assurance, which are other key topics of interest for the workshop. The idea is highly relevant to the workshop's aim of discussing novel solutions to address emerging challenges in LLM trustworthiness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, proposed solution, and expected outcomes. The multi-stage pipeline is explained in a logical sequence (retrieval → generation → verification), and the training methodology is described with sufficient detail. The only minor ambiguities are in the specifics of how the generator and verifier 'share representations' and the exact implementation details of the contrastive learning approach. While these technical details would need elaboration in a full paper, the core concept is presented with strong clarity for an initial proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining several existing techniques (retrieval-augmentation, contrastive learning, and verification) in a novel way. The joint optimization of generator and verifier is a fresh approach to the hallucination problem. However, retrieval-augmented generation and fact verification are active research areas with many existing approaches. While this proposal offers a new combination and training methodology, it builds upon rather than fundamentally reimagines existing paradigms. The contrastive learning between true and decoy citations adds an innovative element, but the overall framework follows established retrieval-augmented generation patterns."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is highly feasible with current technology and methods. All components (retriever, generator, verifier) use established techniques, and the datasets mentioned (FEVER and Truthful-QA) are publicly available benchmarks. The joint training of generator and verifier might present some optimization challenges, but these are likely manageable given recent advances in multi-objective training. The lightweight nature of the verifier is a practical consideration that enhances feasibility. The research team would need access to substantial computational resources for training large language models, but this is standard for research in this domain."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in LLM deployment: hallucinations undermine trust and limit practical applications in high-stakes domains. The expected 15% reduction in hallucination rates would represent a substantial improvement with immediate practical benefits. The approach's emphasis on interpretability (through linked evidence and confidence scores) further enhances its significance, as it not only reduces hallucinations but provides mechanisms for users to verify outputs. This work could significantly advance trustworthy AI by providing a systematic approach to grounding LLM outputs in verifiable evidence, which is essential for responsible deployment in domains like healthcare, legal, and educational applications."
