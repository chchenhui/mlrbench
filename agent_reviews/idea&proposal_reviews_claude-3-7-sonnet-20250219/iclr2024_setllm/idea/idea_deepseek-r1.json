    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on secure and trustworthy LLMs. It directly addresses 'Adversarial attacks and defenses in LLMs,' which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest. The proposal tackles a specific security vulnerability (latent-space adversarial attacks) and offers a defense mechanism to enhance model reliability. The idea also touches on interpretability and reliability assurance, which are other key topics mentioned in the workshop description. The only minor limitation in alignment is that it focuses specifically on embedding-level attacks rather than addressing multiple security challenges, but this focused approach is still highly relevant to the workshop's goals."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (adversarial attacks in latent space), the proposed solution (a three-component defense framework), and the evaluation methodology. The three main components—perturbation detector, robust alignment layer, and dynamic gradient regularization—are well-defined with their specific functions explained. The evaluation metrics and expected outcomes are also clearly stated. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific implementation of the contrastive learning approach, how the robust alignment layer would be integrated into existing LLM architectures, and the exact mechanism of the dynamic gradient regularization during inference. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by focusing on latent-space adversarial defenses for LLMs, an area that has received less attention compared to input-level defenses. The combination of a perturbation detector, robust alignment layer, and dynamic gradient regularization represents a novel integrated approach. The use of contrastive learning specifically for detecting embedding perturbations is innovative. However, individual components draw from existing techniques in adversarial defense literature (contrastive learning, adversarial training, gradient regularization), albeit applied in a new context. While the integration is creative, the fundamental techniques themselves are adaptations of established methods rather than completely groundbreaking approaches, which is why it doesn't receive a higher novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears feasible with current technology and methods. The three-component approach builds upon established techniques (contrastive learning, adversarial training, gradient regularization) that have proven effective in other contexts. The evaluation plan using benchmark datasets and existing attack methods is practical. However, there are implementation challenges that could affect feasibility: (1) Training an effective perturbation detector might require extensive data generation and fine-tuning; (2) Integrating the robust alignment layer without significantly increasing computational overhead could be challenging; (3) Dynamic gradient regularization during inference might introduce latency issues for real-time applications. The proposal acknowledges computational overhead as an evaluation metric, suggesting awareness of these challenges, but doesn't fully detail how they'll be addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a significant security vulnerability in LLMs that could have major implications for their trustworthiness in high-stakes applications. As LLMs continue to be deployed in critical domains like healthcare and finance (as mentioned in the proposal), protecting against sophisticated adversarial attacks becomes increasingly important. The focus on latent-space attacks is particularly valuable as these are more difficult to detect than input-level attacks. If successful, the proposed defense mechanism could substantially improve LLM security with minimal performance impact. The significance is enhanced by the growing reliance on LLMs across industries and the corresponding increase in potential attack surfaces. The work could establish new standards for embedding-level security in language models, though its impact might be somewhat limited to the specific threat model of latent-space attacks rather than addressing broader security concerns."
