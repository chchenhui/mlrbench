        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Causal Diffusion Models (CDMs) idea aligns excellently with the task description for the Causal Representation Learning Workshop. It directly addresses the core challenge mentioned in the task: integrating causal relationships into deep representation models to overcome spurious correlations and algorithmic bias. The proposal specifically targets the intersection of causal discovery and generative models, which is explicitly listed as a topic of interest ('Causal generative models'). The idea also touches on applications in healthcare/biomedical imaging, which aligns with the workshop's interest in applications of causal representation learning. The only minor limitation in consistency is that it doesn't explicitly address benchmarking, which was one of the listed topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (spurious correlations in generative models), proposes a specific solution (embedding causal graph structures into diffusion models), and outlines the technical approach (joint optimization for data reconstruction and causal disentanglement). The two-step process involving causal discovery and integration with the diffusion process is well-explained. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific mechanisms for implementing the causal constraints during the diffusion process and how exactly the causal discovery module would operate in practice. The evaluation metrics are mentioned but could be more precisely defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel integration of causal representation learning with diffusion models, which represents a significant innovation in the field. While both causal discovery and diffusion models exist separately, their combination in the proposed manner appears to be original. The concept of aligning each denoising step with an inferred causal graph is particularly innovative. The approach goes beyond simply applying existing causal discovery methods to generative models by proposing a joint optimization framework. However, similar concepts of incorporating causal structures into generative models have been explored in other contexts (e.g., with VAEs or GANs), which slightly reduces the novelty score from perfect."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of the proposed research faces several challenges. While diffusion models and causal discovery methods are well-established individually, their integration poses significant technical hurdles. The proposal acknowledges the need for interventional data or domain constraints, which may not always be available in practice. The computational complexity of jointly optimizing for both high-quality generation and causal disentanglement could be substantial. Additionally, evaluating causal correctness in the latent space is notoriously difficult, especially without ground truth causal graphs. The idea is implementable in principle, but would likely require considerable methodological innovations and computational resources to realize fully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is very high. If successful, Causal Diffusion Models could address a fundamental limitation of current generative AI systems: their reliance on correlational rather than causal patterns. This has profound implications for applications in critical domains like healthcare, where understanding and controlling causal factors is essential. The ability to generate counterfactual examples guided by causal factors would enhance interpretability and trustworthiness of AI systems. Furthermore, the approach could provide a framework for testing causal hypotheses in domains where interventional experiments are costly or unethical. The potential impact extends beyond the specific implementation to advancing our understanding of causality in deep learning more broadly."
