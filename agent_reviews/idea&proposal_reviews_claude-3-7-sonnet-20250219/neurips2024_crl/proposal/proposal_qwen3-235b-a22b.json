    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on causal representation learning by proposing Causal Diffusion Models that disentangle latent causal factors. The proposal incorporates the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as identifying latent causal variables, handling confounders, and ensuring interpretability. It builds upon recent works like DeCaFlow and CausalBGM while extending their concepts to diffusion models. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposal will address the limitations of current generative models by incorporating causal structures. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions C2VAE from 2024, the proposal references it as a baseline but doesn't fully explain how CDMs improve upon its specific approach to correlation-aware causal modeling."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The causal graph learning process, integration into the diffusion process, and experimental design are all thoroughly explained. The proposal uses consistent terminology and provides clear definitions of key concepts. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) The exact mechanism for how the causal masking matrix M_G is derived from the causal graph G could be more explicitly defined; (2) The relationship between the latent space z and the diffusion process variables x_t could be more clearly explained; and (3) Some of the evaluation metrics like MIG could benefit from more detailed explanations for readers unfamiliar with these specific measures."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of causal representation learning with diffusion models, which has not been extensively explored in the literature. The innovation lies in embedding causal graph structures directly into the diffusion process, particularly through the causal masking and consistency loss mechanisms. This approach extends beyond existing methods like DeCaFlow and CausalBGM by specifically adapting causality to the iterative denoising process of diffusion models. The hybrid causal discovery module that combines score-based methods, interventional data, and domain constraints is also innovative. While individual components (causal discovery, diffusion models) exist separately, their integration in this manner represents a significant advancement. The proposal loses some novelty points because it builds upon existing frameworks rather than proposing an entirely new paradigm, and some of the techniques (like using masking to enforce structural constraints) have parallels in other domains of machine learning."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations by properly formulating the structural causal model and clearly defining the mathematical framework for both the causal discovery and diffusion processes. The loss functions are well-defined, and the approach to integrating causal constraints into the diffusion process is technically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential identifiability issues in learning the causal graph from observational data; (2) The assumption that the causal graph remains fixed throughout the diffusion process may be limiting; (3) The proposal doesn't thoroughly discuss how to handle potential conflicts between the diffusion objective and causal constraints; and (4) While the evaluation metrics are appropriate, the expected performance thresholds (e.g., SHD < 0.15) would benefit from more justification based on theoretical or empirical grounds."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially implementable research direction. The methodology builds on established techniques in both causal inference and diffusion models, which provides a solid foundation. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) Causal discovery in high-dimensional latent spaces is notoriously difficult, and the proposal doesn't fully address how to overcome this challenge at scale; (2) The integration of causal constraints into the diffusion process may significantly increase computational complexity, potentially making training prohibitively expensive; (3) The availability of interventional data, which would greatly aid causal discovery, is assumed in some parts but may be limited in practice; (4) The proposal doesn't provide a clear timeline or resource requirements for implementation; and (5) The evaluation of counterfactual accuracy requires ground truth counterfactuals, which may be unavailable for real-world datasets. These challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, but they do present significant hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current generative AI systems by incorporating causal reasoning, which could substantially improve their trustworthiness, interpretability, and controllability. The potential impact spans multiple domains: (1) In healthcare, CDMs could enable more reliable synthetic data generation for training diagnostic models while preserving privacy; (2) In economics, they could support policy analysis through counterfactual scenarios; (3) In fairness and ethics, they could help mitigate algorithmic bias by disentangling sensitive attributes. The proposal aligns perfectly with the growing recognition that causal understanding is essential for advancing AI beyond pattern recognition. If successful, this research could establish a new paradigm for generative models that combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the interpretability of causal reasoning. The long-term vision of Causal Foundation Models represents a significant step toward more robust and trustworthy AI systems. The significance is particularly high given the increasing deployment of generative AI in high-stakes domains where understanding causal factors is crucial."
