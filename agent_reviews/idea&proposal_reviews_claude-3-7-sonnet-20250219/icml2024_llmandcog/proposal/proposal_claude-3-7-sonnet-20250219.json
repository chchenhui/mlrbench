    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on assessing LLMs' cognitive abilities, particularly in planning and theory of mind. The Dynamic Curriculum Benchmark (DCB) framework elaborated in the proposal faithfully expands on the core idea of creating adaptive task sequences that scale in difficulty based on model performance. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the literature review, including addressing the challenges of comparing fine-tuned vs. modular architectures (as in Cross et al.'s 'Hypothetical Minds'), measuring emergent planning behaviors (as noted by Dong et al.), and evaluating ToM capabilities in multi-agent settings (as studied by Li et al.). The methodology section thoroughly addresses the adaptive benchmarking challenge highlighted in the literature review, and the human-in-the-loop validation component directly responds to the validation challenge mentioned."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The technical aspects of the DCB framework are explained in detail, with precise definitions of task parameters, generation algorithms, and evaluation metrics. Mathematical formulations for the adaptive sampling algorithm and performance metrics are provided with appropriate notation. The capability hierarchies for both planning and ToM domains are clearly defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the task generator G_d(p_d) could be more specific, (2) the relationship between the CGI and CTI metrics could be better explained in terms of how they complement each other, and (3) some technical terms (like 'bandit problem') are used without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with reinforcement learning concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach to LLM evaluation through its dynamic, adaptive benchmarking framework. The DCB represents a significant departure from traditional static benchmarks by incorporating reinforcement learning-based task generation that adapts to model performance in real-time. The formulation of cognitive task difficulty as a multi-dimensional parameter space is original and well-conceived. The proposal's integration of emergence threshold detection and capability hierarchies provides a novel framework for precisely characterizing when and how cognitive abilities emerge in LLMs. The metrics introduced (Cognitive Generalization Index and Cognitive Transfer Index) are innovative contributions to the field of AI evaluation. While the individual components (RL-based task generation, adaptive difficulty, human validation) have precedents in other domains, their combination and application to emergent cognitive abilities in LLMs is highly original. The proposal builds upon existing work in ToM and planning evaluation but extends it significantly through its dynamic curriculum approach."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The task generation algorithm is well-formulated mathematically, with clear definitions of the optimization objective and update rules. The capability hierarchies for planning and ToM are grounded in cognitive science literature. The human validation protocol is comprehensive and includes appropriate checks for inter-rater reliability. However, there are some areas where the soundness could be improved: (1) The bandit formulation for task difficulty adaptation lacks details on how to handle the multi-dimensional nature of the difficulty parameters, which could lead to exploration challenges in high-dimensional spaces. (2) The proposal doesn't fully address potential confounds in measuring emergence thresholds, such as the influence of prompt engineering or in-context learning. (3) While the metrics are well-defined mathematically, their empirical validation is not thoroughly discussed. (4) The proposal could benefit from more explicit connections to formal theories of planning and ToM from cognitive science to ensure construct validity of the tasks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the researchers clearly define the technical components needed and provide a structured evaluation protocol. The task generation approach using parameterized templates is practical and implementable. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) The scale of human validation required (3 evaluators reviewing 100 tasks per domain and difficulty level, plus evaluating responses from 5 different LLMs) represents a significant resource commitment that may be difficult to sustain. (2) The adaptive task sampling algorithm requires 1000 iterations per domain per model, which could be computationally expensive when evaluating multiple large models. (3) The proposal doesn't address potential challenges in automatically scoring responses to complex ToM and planning tasks, which often require nuanced interpretation. (4) The development of task generators that can reliably produce valid, coherent tasks across the full spectrum of difficulty parameters may prove challenging, especially for higher-order ToM scenarios. (5) The proposal lacks a clear timeline or resource allocation plan to assess overall feasibility within a reasonable research timeframe."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposed research addresses a critical gap in our understanding and evaluation of emergent cognitive abilities in LLMs. Its significance is substantial for several reasons: (1) It provides a methodological breakthrough in AI evaluation by moving beyond static benchmarks to dynamic, adaptive frameworks that can precisely characterize emergence thresholds. (2) The research directly addresses a central question in the workshop description: 'Where do LLMs stand in terms of performance on cognitive tasks, such as reasoning, navigation, planning, and theory of mind?' (3) The benchmark would enable meaningful comparisons between different architectural approaches (fine-tuned end-to-end vs. modular augmented systems), addressing another key workshop topic. (4) The expected outcomes would provide actionable insights for LLM developers seeking to enhance cognitive capabilities. (5) The approach bridges AI and cognitive science by creating evaluation frameworks grounded in cognitive theory while applicable to state-of-the-art AI systems. (6) The methodology could be extended to other cognitive domains and multimodal models, suggesting broad impact potential. The research could fundamentally change how we evaluate and understand emergent capabilities in AI systems."
