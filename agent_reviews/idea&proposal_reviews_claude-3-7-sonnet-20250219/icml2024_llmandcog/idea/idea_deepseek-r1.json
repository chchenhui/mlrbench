    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. The workshop focuses on assessing LLMs' cognitive abilities and understanding their position in the landscape of intelligent systems, and the proposed benchmark framework directly addresses this by creating a more sophisticated evaluation method for LLM cognition. The idea specifically targets the workshop topic of 'improving existing benchmarks and evaluation methods to rigorously assess cognitive abilities in LLMs' and touches on several other listed topics including reasoning, planning, and theory of mind. The proposal's emphasis on collaborating with cognitive scientists also aligns with the workshop's interdisciplinary approach."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (limitations of current benchmarks), proposes a specific solution (dynamic cognitive benchmarking inspired by human cognitive assessment), and outlines key components (multi-step reasoning tasks, process-focused metrics, transfer learning challenges). The methodology is described with concrete examples of task types. However, it could benefit from more specific details about implementation methodology and exactly how the metrics would be quantified, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score. The overall vision and approach are nonetheless communicated effectively."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by proposing a fundamental shift in how we evaluate LLMs' cognitive abilities. While cognitive testing of AI systems isn't entirely new, the specific approach of adapting neuropsychological testing protocols to create dynamic, process-oriented benchmarks represents a fresh perspective. The focus on evaluating the reasoning process rather than just outcomes is particularly innovative. The integration of theory of mind assessment and real-time adaptation requirements pushes beyond conventional benchmarking approaches. It doesn't receive a perfect score because some elements build upon existing work in cognitive assessment, but the comprehensive framework and application to LLMs constitute a novel contribution."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. Creating dynamic cognitive benchmarks inspired by human assessment protocols is achievable with current technology and methodologies. The proposal to collaborate with cognitive scientists strengthens feasibility by leveraging established expertise. However, several practical challenges exist: (1) designing truly dynamic scenarios that test adaptation may require complex simulation environments, (2) developing metrics that reliably measure process quality rather than just outcomes is methodologically challenging, and (3) ensuring the benchmark's validity as a measure of cognitive abilities requires careful validation. These challenges are surmountable but require significant effort, justifying the score of 7."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current LLM evaluation practices and could substantially impact the field. By developing more sophisticated cognitive benchmarks, it would provide deeper insights into LLMs' true capabilities and limitations, potentially redirecting research efforts toward addressing fundamental cognitive shortcomings. The proposed taxonomy of cognitive strengths/weaknesses would be valuable for both theoretical understanding and practical development. The emphasis on process over outcomes could transform how we conceptualize AI evaluation more broadly. The interdisciplinary approach connecting AI with cognitive science could foster valuable cross-pollination between fields. This work could significantly influence how we measure progress toward human-like AI cognition."
