        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on touch processing, specifically tackling the temporal and active nature of touch sensing. The proposal incorporates the research idea of self-supervised learning for temporal-aware tactile representations through active exploration, developing both a contrastive learning module and a reinforcement learning agent as suggested. It thoroughly references and builds upon the literature review, addressing key challenges like limited labeled data (Challenge 1), temporal dynamics modeling (Challenge 3), and active exploration strategies (Challenge 4). The proposal also aligns with the workshop's goal of building community resources by promising to release a large-scale dataset and open-source code."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research gap, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, with mathematical formulations for the contrastive learning objective and reward functions. The overall framework (AT-TCE) is clearly defined with its two main components (TCLM and AEM) and their interaction. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-specified. There are only minor areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as more details on the specific hardware implementation and potential challenges in the joint training procedure."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of temporal contrastive learning and active exploration for tactile representation learning. While both contrastive learning for tactile data and active exploration have been explored separately (as noted in the literature review), their combination into a unified, self-reinforcing framework represents a significant innovation. The approach of using self-supervised signals from the contrastive learning module to guide the reinforcement learning agent's exploration policy is particularly novel. The proposal also introduces a new large-scale active tactile dataset (LATID), which would be a valuable contribution to the field given the noted scarcity of tactile data. The temporal aspects of the contrastive learning approach are well-developed beyond existing methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The technical foundations of the proposal are generally sound. The contrastive learning approach builds on established methods like InfoNCE, and the reinforcement learning component uses well-validated algorithms like SAC or PPO. The reward function design is theoretically justified, combining representation change/novelty, contrastive loss maximization, exploration bonuses, and regularization. However, there are some areas where more rigorous justification would strengthen the proposal: (1) The exact mechanism for how the TCLM and AEM will co-adapt during training could be more precisely defined; (2) The potential challenges in reward function design and stability during joint training could be more thoroughly addressed; (3) The theoretical guarantees or convergence properties of the joint learning system are not discussed. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces several implementation challenges. The hardware requirements (robotic arm with tactile sensors) are reasonable and commonly available in research labs. The data collection plan for LATID is well-defined and achievable. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The joint training of the TCLM and AEM may be computationally intensive and potentially unstable, requiring careful hyperparameter tuning; (2) The design of an effective intrinsic reward function that balances exploration and exploitation is notoriously difficult in reinforcement learning; (3) The scale of the proposed dataset collection (thousands of interaction sequences across 50-100 materials) represents a significant time investment; (4) Real-world robotic data collection often faces practical challenges like sensor wear, calibration drift, and environmental variations. While these challenges don't make the proposal impractical, they do suggest that significant engineering effort and potential methodological adjustments may be needed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in tactile perception research by developing a framework that explicitly models both the temporal dynamics and active nature of touch. If successful, this work would make several significant contributions: (1) A novel framework integrating self-supervised learning and active exploration for tactile perception; (2) A large-scale tactile dataset that addresses the data scarcity problem highlighted in the literature review; (3) Open-source tools that lower the barrier to entry for touch processing research, directly supporting the workshop's community-building goals; (4) Insights into optimal exploration strategies for tactile perception. The potential applications span robotics (manipulation, agriculture, telemedicine), prosthetics, and AR/VR, aligning with the workshop's vision. The work could significantly advance our understanding of computational touch processing, particularly in how temporal dynamics and active exploration contribute to tactile perception."
