    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on fine-tuning large pre-trained models for robotics with limited hardware while ensuring safe deployment. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including the safety adapters concept, contrastive learning on offline data, and safety-constrained RL. The methodology thoroughly addresses challenges identified in the literature review, particularly regarding parameter-efficient adaptation (papers 1-3) and safe reinforcement learning (papers 4-10). The proposal's emphasis on safety guarantees, computational efficiency, and generalization directly responds to the key challenges outlined in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical formulations are precise and well-defined, with appropriate mathematical notation and algorithmic descriptions. The two-phase approach (pre-training and fine-tuning) is clearly delineated, and the safety mechanisms are thoroughly explained. The experimental design section provides concrete metrics and evaluation procedures. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact relationship between the safety critic and the shield mechanism could be more explicitly defined, and (2) some technical details about how the adapters are integrated with the VLPM architecture could be more thoroughly explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of parameter-efficient adapters with safety-constrained RL for vision-language models in robotics represents a fresh approach. The contrastive pre-training objective for aligning semantic and control embeddings is innovative, as is the dual-critic system with shielding for safe fine-tuning. However, many of the individual components draw from existing work in the literature - adapters from papers 1-3 and safety mechanisms from papers 4-10. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score. The primary innovation lies in the specific combination and application of these techniques to the vision-language robotics domain."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks. The contrastive learning approach for pre-training is based on solid principles, and the CMDP formulation for safe RL is mathematically rigorous. The Conservative Q-Learning approach with safety critics and shielding has strong theoretical foundations. The experimental design includes appropriate metrics and evaluation procedures across both simulated and real-world settings. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) the theoretical guarantees for the safety bounds could be more explicitly derived, and (2) the convergence properties of the joint optimization of adapters and safety critics could be more thoroughly analyzed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The adapter-based fine-tuning approach is practical and has been demonstrated in similar contexts (as shown in papers 1-3). The safety-constrained RL methods have precedent in the literature (papers 4-10). The computational requirements are reasonable, with the proposal explicitly targeting efficiency (<5% of parameters, <1 hour on a single GPU). The experimental design includes both simulated benchmarks and real-world evaluation, which is appropriate. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the integration of safety critics with large VLPMs may require significant engineering effort, (2) the real-world deployment on hardware introduces complexities not fully addressed, and (3) the collection of sufficient offline multi-modal logs for pre-training may be challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in robotics: enabling safe, efficient adaptation of large vision-language models to robotic tasks with limited resources. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus and addresses multiple key challenges identified in the literature review. The potential impact is substantial, as it could democratize access to advanced AI capabilities for robotics researchers with limited computational resources. The safety guarantees are particularly significant for real-world deployment. The approach could enable new applications in warehouse automation, assistive robotics, and field robotics. The open-sourcing of adapter modules and pre-training logs would further amplify the impact. While the approach is significant, it may not be completely transformative as it builds upon existing paradigms rather than introducing an entirely new framework."
