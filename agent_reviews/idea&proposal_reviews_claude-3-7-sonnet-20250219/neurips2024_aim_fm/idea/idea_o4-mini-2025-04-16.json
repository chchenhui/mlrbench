    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The SecEx-Health proposal aligns excellently with the task description, addressing multiple key topics outlined in the workshop. It directly tackles 'Patient Privacy' through federated learning and differential privacy, 'Explainable MFMs' via its attention-driven explanation module, and 'Multimodal Learning' through its cross-modal fusion backbone. The proposal also touches on 'Robust Diagnosis' by benchmarking against multi-center datasets and 'Human-AI Interaction' through clinician trust evaluations. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address resource constraints or fairness considerations, though these could be implicit in the implementation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with clear objectives, methods, and evaluation metrics. The proposal specifies the transformer-based architecture, privacy guarantees (ε≤1), and target performance metrics (≥95% of centralized baseline). The explanation mechanisms (saliency heatmaps and concept activation vectors) are clearly identified. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific transformer architecture, how the cross-modal fusion backbone works with heterogeneous inputs, and the exact methodology for the clinician trust user studies. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining several advanced approaches in a novel way. The integration of federated learning with differential privacy for multimodal medical data, coupled with explainability mechanisms, represents a fresh approach to medical foundation models. However, each individual component (federated learning, differential privacy, multimodal fusion, explainability techniques) has been explored in prior research. The innovation lies in their combination and application to medical foundation models rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The proposal builds upon existing approaches in a thoughtful way rather than presenting a groundbreaking new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal faces several implementation challenges that affect its feasibility. While federated learning and differential privacy are established techniques, implementing them effectively across multiple hospitals with heterogeneous data systems presents significant coordination challenges. Achieving the target performance (≥95% of centralized baseline) while maintaining strong privacy guarantees (ε≤1) is ambitious, as privacy protections typically reduce model accuracy. The multimodal nature adds another layer of complexity, especially for medical data where modalities may have different formats and standards across institutions. The user studies with clinicians will require careful design and IRB approvals. These challenges are surmountable but will require considerable resources, expertise, and time."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The SecEx-Health proposal addresses critical barriers to AI adoption in healthcare: privacy concerns and lack of explainability. If successful, it could significantly impact medical practice by enabling AI assistance in sensitive clinical environments while maintaining patient privacy and building clinician trust. The focus on underserved environments aligns with the task's emphasis on addressing healthcare disparities. The potential to deploy AI diagnostics without compromising privacy or transparency could transform healthcare delivery, especially in regions with limited access to specialists. The dual focus on technical performance and human factors (clinician trust) demonstrates a holistic approach to a significant healthcare challenge."
