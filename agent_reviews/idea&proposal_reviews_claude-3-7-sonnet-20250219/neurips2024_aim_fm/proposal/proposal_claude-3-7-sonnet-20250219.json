    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for explainable Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) as highlighted in the task description, focusing on transparency and interpretability to enhance trust in healthcare AI. The proposal fully embraces the causal reasoning approach outlined in the research idea, developing the 'CausalMFM' framework that integrates causal discovery, causal-aware architecture, and counterfactual explanations. The methodology comprehensively incorporates references from the literature review, including work by Zhang et al. (2023) on causal foundation models, Cheng et al. (2025) on causally-informed critical care, and Shetty & Jordan (2025) on clinical decision support. The proposal also addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as data quality issues, complexity of causal inference, and the interpretability-performance trade-off."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The causal discovery process, model architecture, and explanation generation methods are all well-defined with specific algorithms and equations. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, covering multiple datasets, tasks, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the causal graph learning and the foundation model training could be more explicitly described; (2) some technical terms (e.g., Structural Intervention Distance) are used without sufficient explanation; and (3) the transition between different components of the methodology could be smoother to help readers better understand how they integrate into a cohesive framework."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to integrating causal reasoning with medical foundation models. The CausalMFM framework offers several innovative components, including: (1) the causal-aware model architecture with specialized causal encoder and attention mechanisms; (2) the counterfactual explanation generation method tailored to medical contexts; and (3) the integration of multimodal medical data in causal discovery. However, while the individual components show innovation, the overall approach builds upon existing work in causal AI and explainable medical models rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The proposal acknowledges its foundations in prior work (e.g., Zhang et al.'s CInA, Cheng et al.'s causally-informed critical care models) and extends these approaches in meaningful but incremental ways. The novelty lies more in the specific application and integration of these techniques in the medical domain rather than in developing entirely new methodological paradigms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological approaches. The causal discovery methods are based on established algorithms (PC algorithm with modifications) and incorporate domain knowledge appropriately. The mathematical formulations for the causal-aware architecture are technically correct and build on solid foundations in graph neural networks and attention mechanisms. The counterfactual explanation generation follows sound principles from causal inference. The evaluation plan is comprehensive and includes appropriate metrics for assessing both predictive performance and explanation quality. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to assess component contributions. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal could more thoroughly address the potential limitations of causal discovery from observational data, particularly regarding unobserved confounders; (2) the assumptions underlying the counterfactual generation process could be more explicitly stated and justified; and (3) more details on how the causal structures will be validated against ground truth (beyond synthetic data) would enhance rigor."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The use of existing datasets (MIMIC-IV, CheXpert, UK Biobank) and pre-trained foundation models as starting points enhances practicality. The multi-stage training approach is sensible and breaks down the complex task into manageable components. The evaluation methodology is well-designed and includes both technical metrics and clinical validation. However, several aspects present implementation challenges: (1) causal discovery from complex, multimodal medical data is notoriously difficult and may not yield reliable causal graphs without significant domain expertise; (2) the clinical validation with 20-30 clinicians may be challenging to organize and execute, particularly obtaining diverse specialties; (3) the computational resources required for training foundation models with causal components could be substantial; and (4) the integration of causal mechanisms into deep learning architectures often faces optimization difficulties. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that may require adjustments to the methodology or scope during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in healthcare AI with far-reaching implications. The lack of explainability in medical foundation models represents a major barrier to clinical adoption, and the proposed causal approach directly tackles this challenge. The potential impact spans multiple domains: (1) Clinical Practice - by providing explanations aligned with medical reasoning, potentially increasing trust and adoption; (2) Regulatory Compliance - addressing transparency requirements in frameworks like the EU AI Act; (3) Research Advancement - bridging causal inference, explainable AI, and medical informatics; (4) Healthcare Equity - potentially extending high-quality medical assistance to underserved regions; and (5) Medical Education - generating explanations that could serve as educational tools. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and provides a convincing case for how CausalMFM could transform how AI systems are used in clinical settings. The significance is further enhanced by the open-source implementation and benchmark datasets that would benefit the broader research community."
