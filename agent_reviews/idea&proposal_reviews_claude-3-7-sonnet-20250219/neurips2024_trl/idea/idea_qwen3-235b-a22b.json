        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses 'Representation Learning for (semi-)Structured Data' by proposing a novel hierarchical Transformer architecture specifically designed for tables. It also covers 'Multimodal Learning' by incorporating different data types within tables and enabling table-text alignment. The proposal mentions applications like text-to-SQL and table QA, which match the 'Applications of TRL models' topic. The idea acknowledges challenges with heterogeneous data sources and noisy tables, touching on 'Domain-specific challenges'. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address the production challenges or benchmarking aspects beyond mentioning WikiSQL and TabMWP."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The three-component architecture (Schema Encoder, Cell Encoder, and Structure-Aware Attention) is well-defined with specific functions for each component. The motivation clearly articulates the problem of existing models losing structural context when processing tables. The pre-training and fine-tuning approach is outlined with specific tasks. However, some technical details could be more precise - for example, the exact mechanism of the 'modality-specific adapters' or how the 'relational embeddings' are constructed could be further elaborated. The implementation details of the structure-aware attention constraints could also benefit from more specificity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to table representation learning. The hierarchical Transformer architecture that explicitly models table structure is a fresh perspective compared to methods that flatten tables. The structure-aware attention mechanism that constrains attention patterns based on table structure is particularly innovative. The integration of multimodal elements through modality-specific adapters is also relatively novel. However, hierarchical attention and position encodings have been explored in other domains, and the use of Transformer architectures for structured data is not entirely new. The idea builds upon existing concepts in a novel way rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. Transformer architectures are well-established, and the proposed extensions (hierarchical structure, position encodings, constrained attention) are implementable with existing deep learning frameworks. The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm is well-understood, and the mentioned benchmarks (WikiSQL, TabMWP) are available for evaluation. The modality-specific adapters might require careful design but are conceptually straightforward. The main implementation challenge would likely be in efficiently handling the structure-aware attention patterns, but this is manageable with current techniques. The computational resources required would be substantial but not prohibitive for academic or industry research."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant gap in current ML approaches to tabular data. Tables are ubiquitous in real-world data (as highlighted in the task description), yet their structural properties are often lost in current models. Improving table representation learning could have far-reaching impacts across multiple domains including database systems, business intelligence, scientific research, and enterprise applications. The potential applications mentioned (text-to-SQL, table QA, automated data analysis) are highly valuable in practice. If successful, this approach could significantly enhance how AI systems interact with structured data, bridging an important gap between unstructured and structured data processing. The impact would be particularly strong for organizations with large amounts of tabular data."
