    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of identifying and mitigating spurious features in foundation models, which is a core concern highlighted in the task description about reliable and responsible FMs. The two-stage pipeline (causal attribution via interventions followed by pruning/reweighting) faithfully implements the main idea presented in the research idea section. The proposal also builds upon and extends the literature review by incorporating causal intervention techniques similar to those in Zhou & Zhu (2024) and Ma et al. (2024), while addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review regarding identifying spurious features and designing effective interventions. The evaluation metrics and expected outcomes are well-aligned with the reliability and responsibility concerns outlined in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is described in a logical sequence with appropriate mathematical formulations. The two-stage pipeline is clearly delineated, with detailed explanations of the intervention techniques, spuriousness scoring, and pruning/reweighting procedures. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for determining factuality in the evaluation metrics could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the spuriousness score threshold Ï„ and the expected performance trade-offs could be more explicitly discussed, and (3) some technical details about how interventions would be implemented efficiently at scale are somewhat underspecified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts into a novel framework. The key innovation lies in the systematic application of causal interventions to identify spurious features in foundation models, followed by a targeted pruning and reweighting approach. While individual components draw from existing work (e.g., causal interventions from Volodin et al., feature reweighting from Zhou & Zhu), the comprehensive pipeline that automates the identification and removal of spurious features represents a fresh approach. The proposal extends beyond prior work like SEraser by operating directly on hidden activations rather than just prompts, and by providing a quantitative spuriousness score. However, the core techniques of intervention, pruning, and contrastive learning are established methods in the field, limiting the proposal's groundbreaking nature. The novelty is more in the integration and application to foundation models than in fundamentally new algorithmic innovations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The causal framework is grounded in established principles from Pearl's do-calculus, and the intervention techniques (masking, scaling, swapping) are appropriate for isolating feature effects. The mathematical formulations for spuriousness scoring and the contrastive reweighting loss are technically correct and well-motivated. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, variants, and statistical analyses. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes mechanisms to address them, such as the contrastive invariance loss to handle moderate spurious features. However, there are some theoretical assumptions that could benefit from further justification: (1) the assumption that interventions on individual features can cleanly isolate their causal effects in deeply interconnected neural networks, and (2) the assumption that the proposed spuriousness score will reliably identify truly spurious (rather than important but sensitive) features. These assumptions, while reasonable, could benefit from more rigorous theoretical validation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible approach, though with several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the methodology builds on established techniques and uses existing models and datasets. The two-stage pipeline is clearly defined with concrete steps. However, significant feasibility concerns include: (1) Computational cost - performing interventions on each feature across multiple examples would be extremely computationally intensive for large foundation models with billions of parameters; (2) Access limitations - full access to internal activations may be restricted for proprietary models like GPT-3.5; (3) Evaluation complexity - assessing factuality at scale would require sophisticated fact-checking systems or extensive human evaluation; (4) Fine-tuning challenges - retraining large foundation models, even with most parameters frozen, requires substantial computational resources. The proposal acknowledges the need to report compute cost overhead but doesn't fully address how these computational challenges would be managed. The feasibility would be significantly higher for smaller models or if applied to specific layers rather than the entire model."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI reliability and responsibility - the presence of spurious features in foundation models that lead to hallucinations, biases, and poor generalization. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) Practical utility - reducing hallucination rates by 20% and improving calibration would significantly enhance the reliability of foundation models in real-world applications; (2) Methodological contribution - providing a systematic, automated pipeline for identifying and mitigating spurious features advances the field's technical capabilities; (3) Ethical importance - improving fairness metrics by reducing demographic biases aligns with responsible AI principles; (4) Transparency - the spuriousness scores offer interpretable measures of feature reliability. The approach is also generalizable across different modalities and tasks, enhancing its broader impact. The significance is somewhat limited by feasibility challenges that might restrict full implementation at scale, but even partial implementation or application to smaller models would provide valuable insights and improvements."
