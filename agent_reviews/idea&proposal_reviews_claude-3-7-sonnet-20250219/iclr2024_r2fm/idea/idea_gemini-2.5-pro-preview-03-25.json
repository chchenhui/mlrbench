        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing the core challenge of foundation model reliability. It directly tackles the question of 'How can we pinpoint and understand the causes behind known or emerging sources of FM unreliability?' by examining training data characteristics. The proposal also addresses 'Interventions during pre-training to enhance the reliability and responsibility of FMs' through its proactive approach to data curation. The causal analysis methodology is highly relevant to the workshop's focus on reliable and responsible foundation models, offering a systematic approach to identify problematic data segments before full-scale training."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, methodology, and expected outcomes. The proposal outlines a specific approach: segmenting pre-training data, training probe models on different combinations, analyzing causal influences on failure modes, and creating a causal map for data curation. The methodology is described in sufficient detail to understand the overall approach. However, some minor ambiguities exist around the specific attribution techniques that would be scaled to large models and how exactly the causal analysis would be implemented across massive datasets. These details would benefit from further elaboration, but the core idea remains clear and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by shifting from reactive interventions during fine-tuning to proactive reliability shaping during pre-training. While data quality assessment for machine learning is not new, the causal approach to linking specific data characteristics to downstream reliability issues represents a fresh perspective. The proposal innovatively combines several existing techniques (data segmentation, probe models, attribution methods) into a novel framework specifically designed for foundation models. The causal mapping between pre-training data properties and reliability metrics is particularly innovative and addresses a gap in current research, which often treats pre-training data as a monolithic entity rather than identifying problematic segments causally."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. Training multiple probe foundation models, even at smaller scales, requires substantial computational resources. Establishing clear causal relationships between specific data segments and downstream reliability issues is methodologically complex, especially given the black-box nature of large models. The proposal acknowledges these challenges by suggesting smaller probe models, but scaling attribution techniques to foundation model scale remains difficult. Additionally, isolating the causal effects of specific data characteristics when models learn from diverse, interconnected concepts presents statistical challenges. While the core approach is implementable with current technology, it would require significant computational resources and methodological refinements to execute effectively."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI development: the fundamental reliability of foundation models. By targeting pre-training data characteristics that lead to unreliability, the approach could lead to more inherently trustworthy models from the ground up, rather than applying post-hoc fixes. The potential impact is substantial across all domains using foundation models, as it could reduce hallucinations, biases, and other failure modes at their source. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on reliability and responsibility. If successful, this methodology could establish new best practices for data curation in foundation model development, potentially influencing how all large models are trained in the future and addressing one of the most pressing challenges in responsible AI development."
