        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable optimization for efficient and adaptive foundation models, particularly targeting efficient long context understanding, sub-quadratic models, and retrieval augmentation. The proposed DySRA-SubQ model integrates dynamic sparse retrieval, sub-quadratic processing, and rotating compressive KV caching, which perfectly matches the original research idea. The methodology thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like AttentionRAG for context pruning, GCA for efficient attention mechanisms, and various KV cache compression techniques (RazorAttention, PyramidKV, KV-Compress). The proposal builds upon these existing approaches while addressing their limitations, particularly by combining sparse retrieval with sub-quadratic processing and compressive caching in a novel way."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research problem, objectives, and significance are explicitly stated and logically connected. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the three core components (Dynamic Sparse Retriever, Sub-Quadratic Backbone, Rotating Compressive KV Cache) with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design is comprehensive, including baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the compressed KV cache representations during attention computation could be more precisely defined, (2) the training procedure for the end-to-end co-optimization could be elaborated with more specific algorithmic details, and (3) some of the mathematical formulations, particularly for the RL-based retriever training, could be more rigorously defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach by combining three key elements in a novel way: (1) a dynamic sparse retriever trained via reinforcement learning to minimize retrieved tokens, (2) a sub-quadratic backbone with sparse attention, and (3) a rotating compressive KV cache for constant memory usage. While individual components build upon existing work (e.g., RL for retrieval, sub-quadratic architectures, KV cache compression), their integration into a cohesive system represents a significant advancement. Particularly novel is the RL-based sparse retriever that actively minimizes retrieved tokens based on both relevance and computational cost, the end-to-end co-optimization framework balancing task performance with efficiency, and the rotating compressive KV cache concept for handling streaming data. The proposal goes beyond existing approaches like AttentionRAG (which prunes based on attention scores post-retrieval) and standard KV cache compression methods (which typically operate within a single forward pass) by creating a truly dynamic, adaptive system for continuous context processing."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with appropriate technical formulations and methodological choices. The three main components are grounded in established techniques (RL for sequential decision-making, sub-quadratic attention mechanisms, compression via low-rank projections) and the integration approach is logical. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification or more rigorous formulation: (1) the theoretical guarantees for the performance of the compressed KV cache representations are not fully established, (2) the convergence properties of the proposed end-to-end co-optimization approach are not analyzed, especially given the challenges of training RL components alongside supervised components, (3) the exact mechanism for backpropagating through the discrete retrieval step could be more precisely defined, and (4) the computational complexity analysis could be more formal, particularly regarding the interaction between the retriever and the backbone model."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially feasible research direction. The individual components (RL-based retriever, sub-quadratic backbone, KV cache compression) have precedents in the literature, suggesting their implementation is possible. The datasets and evaluation metrics are well-established and accessible. However, several significant implementation challenges exist: (1) Training the RL-based retriever end-to-end with the backbone model will be computationally intensive and may face optimization difficulties due to the discrete nature of token selection, (2) The proposed alternating optimization strategy might face convergence issues given the complex interaction between the retriever policy and the backbone model, (3) Implementing and optimizing the rotating compressive KV cache for streaming scenarios will require careful engineering to maintain performance while achieving the promised memory benefits, (4) The end-to-end co-optimization with the hybrid loss function balancing multiple objectives (task performance, retrieval sparsity, computational efficiency) will require extensive hyperparameter tuning. While these challenges are acknowledged in the proposal, their difficulty might be underestimated, potentially requiring more computational resources and development time than implied."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in modern AI: enabling foundation models to efficiently process and adapt to long or streaming contexts. If successful, the research would have substantial impact in both theoretical and practical domains. Theoretically, it would advance our understanding of how to integrate retrieval, attention, and memory mechanisms in foundation models. Practically, it could enable new applications requiring real-time processing of long documents or continuous data streams (e.g., financial analysis, legal document processing, news monitoring) with significantly reduced computational resources. The approach directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable optimization for efficient and adaptive foundation models. The potential for constant memory usage with sub-quadratic computation while maintaining performance would represent a significant advancement over current approaches that face quadratic scaling issues. The proposal also has broader implications for sustainable AI, as more efficient models require less energy and computational resources. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on specific architectural innovations rather than fundamental theoretical breakthroughs in optimization or representation learning."
