    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on scalable optimization for efficient and adaptive foundation models, particularly targeting efficient long context understanding and sub-quadratic models. The three-component architecture (dynamic sparse retriever, sparse attention mechanism, and rotating compressive KV cache) perfectly implements the core idea of integrating dynamic sparse retrieval with compressive KV caching. The proposal extensively references and builds upon the literature review, citing works like AttentionRAG, PyramidKV, LongRAG, and Grouped Cross Attention to position the research within the current landscape. The methodology section thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, particularly balancing context length with computational efficiency and effective KV cache management."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the three-component architecture is well-defined with appropriate mathematical formulations. The training and optimization approach, including the reinforcement learning framework for the retriever, is thoroughly explained. The experimental design section provides clear metrics and baselines. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the sparse attention with the compressive KV cache could be more explicitly detailed, (2) the relationship between the RL-based retriever and the end-to-end training could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical details about the rotating policy for the KV cache could be more precisely defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in its integrated approach to long-context efficiency. While individual components build upon existing work (e.g., RAG, sparse attention, KV cache compression), the integration of these components into a unified framework with dynamic adaptation capabilities represents a novel contribution. Particularly innovative aspects include: (1) the RL-based dynamic retriever that adapts the number of retrieved chunks based on query complexity, (2) the modified Grouped Cross Attention mechanism specifically designed for retrieved tokens, and (3) the rotating compressive KV cache with low-rank projections. The proposal goes beyond existing approaches like AttentionRAG and PyramidKV by jointly optimizing retrieval, attention, and caching rather than addressing them in isolation. The end-to-end training approach with a hybrid loss function that balances task accuracy with efficiency constraints is also a fresh perspective."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with appropriate technical formulations and methodological choices. The architecture builds on established techniques in retrieval, attention mechanisms, and KV cache compression. The RL formulation for the dynamic retriever is theoretically justified, and the loss function balances multiple objectives appropriately. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and metrics. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical analysis of the sub-quadratic complexity claims could be more rigorous, (2) the stability of the RL training for the retriever might face challenges that aren't fully addressed, (3) the potential information loss from the compressive KV cache and its impact on model performance isn't thoroughly analyzed, and (4) the interaction effects between the three components might introduce complexities not fully accounted for in the current formulation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction with realistic implementation paths. The three-component architecture can be implemented using existing frameworks and techniques, and the experimental setup with specified datasets and hardware is practical. The use of established baselines and metrics enhances feasibility. However, several challenges may affect implementation: (1) training the RL-based retriever might require substantial computational resources and careful hyperparameter tuning, (2) the end-to-end optimization of multiple components with different objectives could face convergence issues, (3) the NewsStream-24H dataset mentioned may require significant preprocessing and management for streaming experiments, and (4) the simulation of edge-device constraints might not fully capture real-world deployment challenges. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do increase implementation complexity and might require adjustments to the original plan."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in foundation models: balancing long-context understanding with computational efficiency. Its significance is substantial for several reasons: (1) it tackles the quadratic complexity bottleneck of transformer attention, which is a fundamental limitation for scaling, (2) it provides a solution for efficient adaptation to streaming data, which has broad applications in real-time analytics and personalization, (3) the memory efficiency gains from the compressive KV cache could enable deployment on resource-constrained devices, expanding accessibility, and (4) the framework could serve as a blueprint for future sub-quadratic architectures. The expected outcomes of 50-70% lower latency and 60% reduced memory usage would represent meaningful advances in the field. The proposal aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on scalable optimization and efficient adaptation, making it highly relevant to the current research landscape."
