    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The DiffuNA proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the AI4NA workshop's focus on AI applications for nucleic acids, specifically targeting RNA therapeutic design through diffusion models. The proposal elaborates comprehensively on the brief idea provided, maintaining the core concept of a 3D graph-based diffusion model for joint learning of RNA sequence and structure. It incorporates the reinforcement learning loop for optimization as mentioned in the original idea. The proposal also builds upon the literature review effectively, citing relevant works like RiboDiffusion and DiffSBDD as baselines and addressing key challenges identified in the literature review such as data scarcity and the complexity of RNA folding. The methodology section demonstrates awareness of existing tools mentioned in the literature (trRosettaRNA, FARFAR2, UFold) and proposes solutions to the challenges identified."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined with numbered points, making the goals explicit. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the model architecture, including mathematical formulations of the diffusion process and loss functions. The experimental design outlines specific benchmarks and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating user constraints during generation could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the diffusion process and the sequence-structure joint optimization could be more explicitly explained, and (3) some technical details about the SE(3)-equivariant GNN implementation are somewhat abstract. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible but has minor areas that could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing approaches in a novel way. The integration of 3D graph-based diffusion models with reinforcement learning for RNA therapeutic design represents a fresh approach not fully explored in the literature. The joint modeling of sequence, secondary, and tertiary structures differentiates it from existing methods like RiboDiffusion (which focuses on inverse folding given a structure). The proposal's novelty lies in its comprehensive end-to-end pipeline rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms. While it builds upon existing diffusion models (like DiffSBDD) and RNA structure prediction tools, it adapts these for the specific challenge of RNA therapeutic design. The RL fine-tuning approach with a multi-component reward function is innovative in this context. However, many of the individual components (diffusion models, GNNs, RL optimization) have been applied in adjacent fields, limiting the groundbreaking nature of the technical approach."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The diffusion model formulation is mathematically sound, with clear forward and reverse processes defined. The integration of SE(3)-equivariant GNNs shows awareness of the importance of rotational invariance in 3D molecular modeling. The reinforcement learning component is well-justified with a multi-term reward function that balances stability, affinity, and diversity. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, benchmarks, and statistical analysis methods. The data preprocessing approach is comprehensive, addressing the challenges of representing RNA molecules as 3D graphs. However, there are some minor concerns: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address how it will overcome the data scarcity issue beyond synthetic data generation, (2) the surrogate models for predicting stability and affinity might introduce compounding errors that aren't fully discussed, and (3) the computational complexity of the approach isn't thoroughly analyzed. Despite these minor issues, the overall technical approach is well-founded and rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a somewhat feasible approach but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, it builds upon existing methods and tools (diffusion models, GNNs, docking software) that have demonstrated success in related domains. The data sources are well-identified, and the evaluation metrics are clearly defined. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The data scarcity issue for RNA 3D structures is acknowledged but not fully resolved - synthetic data generation may not capture the full complexity of real RNA structures; (2) Training a joint sequence-structure diffusion model with SE(3)-equivariance is computationally intensive and may require substantial GPU resources; (3) The RL fine-tuning loop adds another layer of complexity and computational cost; (4) The surrogate models for predicting folding stability and binding affinity may not be accurate enough to provide reliable rewards for RL optimization; (5) The timeline for implementation is not specified, but the complexity suggests it would require significant development time. While the individual components have been demonstrated elsewhere, integrating them into a cohesive pipeline presents considerable engineering challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in RNA therapeutic design with potential for substantial impact. RNA therapeutics represent a rapidly growing field in medicine, as evidenced by the success of mRNA vaccines and siRNA therapies. The current bottleneck in designing functional RNA molecules is well-established, and an AI-driven approach could significantly accelerate discovery. The expected outcomes include a 2×–5× improvement in binding affinity over existing methods, which would be meaningful for therapeutic development. The open-source release of DiffuNA could democratize access to advanced RNA design tools across the scientific community. The potential applications span multiple therapeutic areas, including personalized medicine for rare mutations. The proposal also aligns with broader trends toward AI-driven drug discovery. While the immediate impact depends on experimental validation beyond computational predictions, the long-term significance could be substantial if the approach enables the design of novel RNA therapeutics that reach clinical testing. The proposal convincingly articulates how success would transform the RNA therapeutic landscape."
