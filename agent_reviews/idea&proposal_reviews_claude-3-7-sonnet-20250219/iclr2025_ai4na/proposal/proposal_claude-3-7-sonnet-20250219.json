    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the AI4NA workshop's focus on AI applications for nucleic acids, specifically targeting RNA therapeutic design through a novel diffusion-based approach. The proposal expands on the brief idea by providing a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 3D graph-based diffusion models, reinforcement learning optimization, and validation plans. It thoroughly addresses the literature review by building upon existing work like RiboDiffusion while extending beyond current capabilities to jointly model sequence and structure. The proposal acknowledges key challenges identified in the literature review, such as data scarcity and the complexity of RNA folding, and proposes specific solutions. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal is more ambitious and detailed than the initial idea, but this represents an enhancement rather than a misalignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with clear mathematical formulations of the diffusion process, neural network architecture, and optimization objectives. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the significance of the work is well-justified. The methodology section provides comprehensive details on data collection, model architecture, training procedures, and validation plans. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the RL optimization loop with the diffusion model could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical terms and concepts might be challenging for non-specialists to understand without additional explanation, and (3) the transition between the diffusion model generation and the RL refinement phase could be more clearly delineated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. First, it introduces a joint sequence-structure optimization approach for RNA design, which goes beyond existing methods like RiboDiffusion that focus primarily on inverse folding. Second, the integration of a 3D equivariant graph diffusion model with a reinforcement learning optimization loop represents a novel technical approach not previously applied to RNA therapeutic design. Third, the proposal addresses the unique challenges of RNA design by incorporating both discrete (sequence) and continuous (structure) variables in a unified diffusion framework. While building upon existing work in diffusion models and equivariant neural networks, DiffuNA combines these elements in an innovative way specifically tailored to RNA therapeutics. The proposal is not entirely groundbreaking as it adapts concepts from protein and small molecule design (as cited in the literature review), but its application to RNA therapeutics and the specific technical innovations represent substantial originality."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in many aspects. The diffusion model formulation is mathematically sound, with clear definitions of forward and reverse processes. The E(3)-equivariant graph neural network architecture is appropriate for capturing 3D structural information while respecting rotational and translational invariance. The multi-objective loss function and training procedure are well-justified. However, there are some areas where the technical soundness could be improved: (1) The proposal assumes that sufficient high-quality RNA 3D structural data exists for training, but the literature review mentions data scarcity as a key challenge; (2) The reinforcement learning reward function relies on surrogate models for folding stability and binding affinity prediction, but the accuracy of these surrogate models is not thoroughly discussed; (3) The proposal does not fully address how to handle the non-unique mapping between RNA sequences and structures (mentioned as a challenge in the literature review); (4) Some of the mathematical formulations, particularly for the RL optimization, could benefit from more rigorous derivation and justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a technically ambitious project with several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the methodology builds upon established techniques in diffusion models and graph neural networks, and the authors propose a reasonable data collection strategy from existing databases. The computational benchmarks and case studies are well-defined and achievable. However, several factors limit the feasibility: (1) The proposal acknowledges data scarcity as a challenge but expects to compile 5,000-10,000 non-redundant RNA structures, which may be optimistic given the limited availability of high-resolution RNA 3D structures; (2) Training a joint sequence-structure diffusion model with E(3)-equivariance is computationally intensive and may require substantial computational resources; (3) The integration of diffusion models with reinforcement learning adds complexity that may introduce training instabilities; (4) The validation plan relies on computational metrics without immediate experimental validation, making it difficult to assess real-world performance; (5) The timeline for implementing such a complex system is not specified, but would likely require significant development effort. While the individual components are feasible, their integration into a cohesive system as described represents a substantial challenge."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical bottleneck in RNA therapeutics development with potentially transformative impact. The significance is high for several reasons: (1) RNA therapeutics represent a rapidly expanding frontier in medicine, as evidenced by the success of mRNA vaccines and the growing interest in RNA-based treatments; (2) Current experimental methods for RNA therapeutic design are time-consuming, expensive, and limited in their exploration of sequence space; (3) A computational approach that accelerates discovery could dramatically reduce development costs and time-to-market for new therapeutics; (4) The technical innovations in joint sequence-structure modeling could advance the broader field of AI for biomolecular design; (5) The proposed open-source release of code and models would benefit the research community. The proposal clearly articulates these points in the introduction and expected outcomes sections, making a compelling case for the significance of the work. The potential applications span multiple domains including precision medicine, pandemic preparedness, and diagnostic platforms, further enhancing the impact."
