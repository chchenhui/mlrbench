        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the AI4NA workshop's focus. It directly addresses multiple core topics including RNA structure prediction, foundation models for nucleic acids, multimodal approaches, and therapeutic applications. The proposal specifically targets RNA design with therapeutic potential, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop description. The integration of structure prediction, function analysis, and the development of foundation models for nucleic acids makes this idea highly relevant to the workshop's stated goals of exploring how AI can address key challenges in nucleic acids research."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The proposal defines a specific technical approach combining active learning with multimodal foundation models and reinforcement learning. The workflow is clearly outlined with three iterative steps: generating candidate sequences, validating them, and updating the foundation model. While the overall concept is well-defined, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific geometric and transformer architectures to be used, the exact reinforcement learning algorithm, and how the system will balance exploration vs. exploitation in the active learning framework."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining several advanced approaches (multimodal foundation models, active learning, and reinforcement learning) in the specific domain of RNA design. While foundation models and active learning are established techniques in machine learning, their application to RNA therapeutic design in this integrated manner represents a fresh approach. The multimodal aspect incorporating sequence, structure, and functional assay data is particularly innovative. However, each individual component (foundation models for biomolecules, active learning for experimental design, RL for molecular optimization) has precedents in the literature, making this more of a novel combination of existing techniques rather than a fundamentally new method."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Training multimodal foundation models requires extensive computational resources and diverse datasets that may be difficult to obtain for RNA, especially for tertiary structures and functional assays. The active learning component requires reliable experimental validation pipelines, which can be costly and time-consuming. The reinforcement learning module needs well-defined reward functions that accurately reflect RNA therapeutic properties. While the individual components (foundation models, active learning, RL) are established techniques, integrating them effectively for RNA design represents a significant engineering challenge. The claimed 2-3x reduction in experimental cost is ambitious and would require careful validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in RNA therapeutics development - the gap between computational predictions and experimental validation. If successful, it could substantially accelerate RNA drug discovery by reducing costly trial-and-error iterations. The potential impact extends beyond RNA therapeutics to synthetic biology and functional RNA systems. The approach of combining foundation models with active learning could establish a new paradigm for biomolecular design that balances computational efficiency with experimental validation. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of RNA therapeutics following the success of mRNA vaccines and the increasing interest in RNA-based treatments for various diseases."
