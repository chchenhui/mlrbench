    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the AI4NA workshop's focus on AI applications for nucleic acids. It specifically addresses RNA secondary structure prediction, which is explicitly mentioned as a key challenge in the task description. The proposal integrates deep learning approaches with biological data, which matches the workshop's goal of bringing together machine learning and biology experts. The idea also has potential therapeutic applications, which aligns with the workshop's interest in 'designing bespoke RNA/DNA molecules with therapeutic potential.' The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other areas mentioned in the task description, such as tertiary structure prediction or foundation models, though it could potentially be extended to these areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact. The proposed approach using CNNs for RNA sequences and RNNs for protein sequences is specific and understandable. The evaluation metrics are also clearly defined. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further elaboration: (1) The exact mechanism of how protein sequence data will improve RNA structure prediction isn't fully explained, (2) The specific attention mechanisms to be used could be more detailed, and (3) The data sources and specific datasets to be used aren't identified. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving the highest clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to integrate protein sequence data with RNA sequence data for secondary structure prediction, which is not commonly done in current methods. The use of attention mechanisms to weigh feature importance is also innovative in this specific context. However, the core deep learning architectures mentioned (CNNs and RNNs) are established techniques in bioinformatics, and hybrid models combining different neural network architectures have been explored in various domains. The proposal builds upon existing methodologies rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts, which is why it receives a good but not excellent novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and resources. Deep learning frameworks for biological sequence analysis are well-established, and there are substantial RNA and protein sequence datasets available in public repositories. The proposed methodologies (CNNs, RNNs, attention mechanisms) are mature technologies with extensive documentation and implementation examples. The evaluation metrics mentioned are standard in the field. The main challenges would be in effectively integrating the protein and RNA data in a meaningful way and ensuring that the model can generalize across different types of RNA molecules. These challenges are significant but surmountable with proper experimental design and validation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is high as RNA secondary structure prediction is fundamental to understanding RNA function and has direct applications in drug development and gene therapy. Improving prediction accuracy could accelerate therapeutic discoveries and enhance our understanding of RNA biology. The integration of protein sequence data could provide new insights into RNA-protein interactions, which are critical in many cellular processes. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications in medicine and biotechnology. However, it doesn't represent a complete paradigm shift in the field, which would be necessary for the highest significance score. The incremental improvement, while valuable, builds on existing approaches rather than fundamentally transforming them."
