        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on probabilistic inference and sampling from unnormalized distributions. It directly addresses the challenge of sampling from distributions weighted by a target density, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop description. The proposal connects learning approaches with sampling methods, which is a central theme of the workshop. The idea would fit well in the 'Research Papers' track as it addresses Bayesian posterior inference and sampling from generative models weighted by target density - both specifically mentioned as example topics. The only minor limitation in alignment is that it doesn't explicitly discuss connections to optimal transport or physics, which are mentioned as discussion topics for the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly defines the problem (sampling from weighted distributions), the proposed solution (amortized guidance network), and the intended application (Bayesian inference and inference-time alignment). The technical approach is well-articulated, explaining how the guidance network modifies the score function to approximate the gradient of the log weighting function. The mathematical formulation (p(x)w(x)/Z) is precise and understandable. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific training methodology for the guidance network and exactly how it integrates with different types of diffusion models, which would benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to amortizing the computation of score guidance for weighted sampling. While score-based diffusion models and guidance techniques exist, the specific focus on learning a separate lightweight network to approximate the gradient of the log weighting function appears to be a fresh perspective. The approach combines existing concepts (diffusion models, score-based sampling, amortized inference) in a new way to address an important problem. However, it builds upon established methods in diffusion modeling and guidance techniques rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which limits its novelty somewhat. Similar approaches may exist in adjacent fields, though the application to inference-time alignment of generative models adds originality."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. The components required (diffusion models, score networks, guidance techniques) are well-established in the field. Training a lightweight guidance network is computationally practical compared to retraining large base models. The approach builds on existing diffusion sampling frameworks, making implementation straightforward for researchers familiar with these methods. The main implementation challenges would likely be in designing effective architectures for the guidance network and ensuring stable training, but these are manageable given current deep learning practices. The approach also offers a practical advantage in computational efficiency at inference time compared to alternatives like MCMC or rejection sampling."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant problem in machine learning with broad applications. Efficient sampling from weighted distributions is crucial for Bayesian inference, alignment of generative models, and scientific applications. The potential impact is substantial as it could enable more efficient inference-time alignment of large language models and diffusion models without expensive retraining, which is particularly relevant given current concerns about AI safety and alignment. The approach could also accelerate Bayesian inference in complex models. While the idea may not revolutionize the entire field of machine learning, it offers a meaningful contribution to an important subfield with practical applications across multiple domains, including both fundamental research and applied AI development."
