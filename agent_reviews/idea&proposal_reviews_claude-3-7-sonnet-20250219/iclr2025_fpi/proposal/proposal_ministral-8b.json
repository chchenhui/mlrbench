    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'sampling from generative models weighted by target density' and 'inference-time alignment.' The proposal elaborates on the core idea of using diffusion-based sampling for LLM alignment without retraining, which matches the original research idea. The methodology section thoroughly develops the mathematical framework mentioned in the idea, including the transition kernel and gradient-based updates. The proposal also acknowledges and builds upon relevant literature, particularly referencing approaches like DiffPO mentioned in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions several papers from 2023-2025, the proposal doesn't explicitly position itself relative to all these works, though it does maintain overall coherence with the field's direction."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with clear algorithmic steps. The mathematical formulation provides precise definitions of the transition kernel and gradient-based updates. The experimental design section outlines evaluation metrics and baseline methods, giving a clear picture of how the approach will be validated. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The exact mechanism for token-level diffusion in language models could be more explicitly defined, as diffusion models were originally designed for continuous spaces rather than discrete tokens; (2) The relationship between the noise schedule and the reward guidance could be elaborated further; and (3) Some technical details about how the transition kernel is actually implemented and trained are somewhat abstract."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by adapting diffusion processes specifically for inference-time alignment of language models. While diffusion models have been applied to text generation before (as noted in the literature review), the specific approach of using a diffusion-inspired sampler with a reward-guided transition kernel for LLM alignment during inference offers a fresh perspective. The token-level diffusion process with learned noise schedules and the lightweight reward-aware proposal distribution are innovative elements. However, the approach shares conceptual similarities with existing work like DiffPO (mentioned in the proposal as a baseline) and other papers in the literature review that explore inference-time control via diffusion processes. The proposal builds incrementally on these existing ideas rather than presenting a completely novel paradigm, which is why it scores a 7 rather than higher."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates rigorous thinking. The mathematical formulation of the transition kernel and gradient-based updates is well-defined and follows established principles from diffusion models and Langevin dynamics. The algorithmic steps are logical and build upon solid theoretical foundations. The evaluation metrics and baseline comparisons are appropriate for validating the approach. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) The convergence properties of the proposed method are not thoroughly analyzed; (2) The trade-offs between computational efficiency and alignment quality could be more rigorously examined; and (3) The proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach. Despite these minor gaps, the overall technical foundation is robust and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation paths. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined, and the method builds upon established techniques in diffusion models and gradient-based optimization. The evaluation metrics and baseline comparisons are practical and achievable. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect its feasibility score: (1) The computational overhead of running diffusion processes during inference may be substantial, potentially limiting real-time applications; (2) Training an effective reward model that accurately captures desired attributes is non-trivial and may require significant data and tuning; (3) The token-level diffusion process for discrete text may require special handling not fully elaborated in the proposal; and (4) The scalability to very large language models might be limited by memory and computational constraints. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they do present significant hurdles that would need to be addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in the field of language model alignment. If successful, the approach could significantly impact how LLMs are aligned with human preferences by enabling dynamic, on-the-fly alignment without costly retraining. This would be particularly valuable for adapting models to diverse user preferences or constraints in real-time applications. The potential benefits in terms of computational efficiency and flexibility compared to traditional RLHF methods are substantial. The approach also contributes to the broader research direction of inference-time control of generative models, which has applications beyond language models. The significance is somewhat limited by potential scalability challenges and the fact that similar approaches are being explored in the field, but the overall potential impact on both practical applications and theoretical understanding of alignment techniques is considerable."
