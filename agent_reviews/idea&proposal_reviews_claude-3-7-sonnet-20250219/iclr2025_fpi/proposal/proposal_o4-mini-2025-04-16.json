    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FPI workshop's focus on sampling from unnormalized distributions, particularly in the context of LLM inference-time alignment. The proposal builds upon the core idea of diffusion-based sampling for target density alignment without retraining, which matches the provided research idea. The methodology incorporates elements from the literature review, including diffusion processes for text generation, gradient-based updates similar to Langevin dynamics, and inference-time control mechanisms. The proposal also addresses the workshop's interest in connections between sampling methods and optimal transport/control, as mentioned in section 2.6 on theoretical analysis. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines mentioned in the literature review, such as SMC-based methods."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally very clear and well-structured. It provides a comprehensive introduction that contextualizes the problem, followed by a detailed methodology section that explains the technical approach with appropriate mathematical formulations. The algorithm is clearly presented with step-by-step procedures. The experimental design, expected outcomes, and timeline are all well-articulated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The transition between continuous embedding space and discrete token space could be explained more thoroughly, particularly how the gradient of the reward with respect to embeddings affects discrete token selection; (2) Some technical details about the diffusion schedules and hyperparameter selection could be more specific; (3) The proposal could more explicitly discuss how the method handles the trade-off between exploration and exploitation during sampling."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The key innovation lies in applying diffusion models specifically to token-level embeddings for LLM alignment, which is described as 'under-explored' in the introduction. The integration of Langevin dynamics with diffusion processes for reward-guided sampling is a fresh approach in the LLM context. The proposal also introduces a lightweight reward-aware critic to handle non-differentiable rewards, which is a practical innovation. However, the core techniques (diffusion models, Langevin dynamics, inference-time alignment) are established in the literature, as evidenced by the literature review. The proposal builds incrementally on these existing methods rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm. Several papers in the literature review already explore diffusion-based inference-time alignment, though perhaps not with the specific token-level approach described here."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The diffusion model formulation is mathematically rigorous, and the connection to Langevin dynamics is properly established. The theoretical analysis in section 2.6 provides convergence guarantees based on established results from the literature. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and includes mechanisms to address them, such as the surrogate reward critic for non-differentiable rewards and Metropolis-Hastings correction for discretization bias. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The discretization of continuous embeddings back to tokens might introduce errors that aren't fully addressed; (2) The proposal could provide more details on how to ensure the Lipschitz continuity assumptions required for theoretical guarantees; (3) The impact of the embedding choice on the overall performance could be more thoroughly analyzed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with a reasonable implementation plan. The methodology builds on established techniques (diffusion models, Langevin dynamics) that have proven successful in related domains. The timeline is realistic, allocating appropriate time for implementation, experimentation, and analysis. The computational requirements, while significant, appear manageable given current resources. However, there are several implementation challenges that might affect feasibility: (1) Training a diffusion model on token embeddings could be computationally intensive; (2) The efficiency of the inference process with multiple diffusion steps might be a bottleneck for practical applications; (3) The differentiability of the reward function through the discrete token mapping is a potential challenge, though the proposal does address this with a surrogate critic; (4) The quality of the embedding space for diffusion might significantly impact results. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could provide more detailed mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in LLM alignment with potentially high impact. If successful, the approach could significantly reduce the computational cost and complexity of aligning LLMs to various objectives, making alignment more accessible and flexible. The ability to perform on-the-fly alignment without retraining would be valuable for many applications, particularly those requiring personalization or dynamic constraints. The theoretical contributions connecting diffusion models, Langevin dynamics, and inference-time alignment could advance understanding in the field. The proposal also has broad applicability across multiple tasks (safety, style, factuality) and could inspire further research on learning-based sampling methods. The expected outcomes include substantial improvements in efficiency (50-80% reduction in compute costs) while maintaining alignment quality, which would be a significant advancement. The open-source contribution of code and models would benefit the research community."
