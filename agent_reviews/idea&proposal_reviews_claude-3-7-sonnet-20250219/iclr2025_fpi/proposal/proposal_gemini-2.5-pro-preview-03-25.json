        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FPI workshop's focus on sampling from unnormalized distributions, particularly in the context of 'sampling from generative models weighted by target density' for inference-time alignment. The proposal builds upon the core idea of using diffusion-based methods for inference-time alignment of LLMs without fine-tuning, as outlined in the research idea. It thoroughly incorporates relevant literature, citing and building upon works mentioned in the literature review such as DiffPO, Sampling Demons, and SMC-based approaches. The theoretical framework, methodology, and expected outcomes are all consistent with the workshop's themes of 'Learning meets Sampling' and the connections between sampling methods and optimal control."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The theoretical framework is presented with appropriate mathematical formulations that explain the diffusion process, reward guidance, and sampling procedures. The algorithmic steps are laid out in a logical sequence, making the implementation approach easy to follow. The experimental design includes well-defined baselines, tasks, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for handling the discrete nature of text in the continuous embedding space could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the denoising model and the base LLM could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical details about the gradient estimation for non-differentiable rewards could be more concrete."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel application of diffusion models to inference-time alignment of LLMs, which is a relatively unexplored area. The key innovations include: (1) adapting diffusion processes to operate on LLM embedding spaces for alignment purposes, (2) incorporating reward guidance into the diffusion sampling process for text generation, and (3) proposing techniques for handling non-differentiable rewards in this context. While the core concepts draw from existing work in diffusion models and inference-time guidance (as cited in the literature review), the specific combination and adaptation to LLM alignment at inference time represents a meaningful contribution. However, the approach shares conceptual similarities with some existing methods like DiffPO and other diffusion-based control techniques, which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly highlighting what specific technical innovations differentiate it from prior work."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The theoretical framework is well-grounded in principles of diffusion models, probabilistic inference, and controlled generation. The mathematical formulations for the forward and reverse processes, as well as the reward guidance mechanism, are technically sound and follow established principles in the field. The connection between the target distribution Ï€(x) and the sampling process is clearly articulated. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, tasks, and evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and challenges, showing awareness of technical hurdles. One area that could be strengthened is the theoretical analysis of convergence guarantees or error bounds for the proposed sampling approach, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional discrete token spaces and potentially non-differentiable rewards."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction, but with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, it builds on existing diffusion model frameworks and LLM architectures, leveraging established techniques from both fields. The data requirements are reasonable, using publicly available models and datasets. The experimental design is practical and well-structured. However, several feasibility concerns exist: (1) The computational cost of running diffusion processes at inference time could be prohibitive for real-time applications, especially with many diffusion steps; (2) Estimating reward gradients for non-differentiable rewards in high-dimensional embedding spaces may be challenging and potentially unstable; (3) The projection from continuous embeddings back to discrete tokens might introduce artifacts or inconsistencies; (4) The training of an effective denoising model specifically for text embeddings could require significant resources. While the proposal acknowledges some of these challenges, it could benefit from more detailed mitigation strategies or fallback approaches."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in LLM alignment with potentially high impact. If successful, this approach could provide a flexible alternative to costly fine-tuning methods like RLHF/DPO, enabling dynamic adaptation to different alignment criteria without retraining. This would be particularly valuable for personalization, domain adaptation, and enforcing safety constraints. The work contributes directly to the FPI workshop's themes around sampling from unnormalized distributions and learning-based samplers. It also bridges diffusion models and LLM control, potentially advancing both fields. The practical applications are numerous and compelling, from safer chatbots to personalized assistants and domain-specific content generation. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and their significance to both the scientific community and practical applications. The main limitation in significance is that the improvement might be incremental rather than transformative if the method faces efficiency challenges that limit its practical deployment."
