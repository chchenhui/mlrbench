        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on learning, control, and dynamical systems, specifically integrating Optimal Transport, Neural ODEs, and Stochastic Optimal Control as mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal fully embraces the research idea of combining Neural ODEs with Optimal Transport for robust control policies, elaborating on how this integration can handle distribution shifts and uncertainties. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with explicit references to key papers like Scagliotti & Farinelli (2023), Pooladian et al. (2024), Sandoval et al. (2022), and others. The proposal also addresses all five key challenges identified in the literature review, including computational complexity, stability, scalability, theoretical guarantees, and stochastic elements integration. The only minor limitation is that some of the referenced papers (e.g., Miao et al., 2025) appear to have future dates, which is slightly inconsistent, but this doesn't significantly impact the overall alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, problem statement, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The mathematical formulation is precise, with well-defined equations for system dynamics, control policy, state distribution evolution, and optimization objectives. The algorithmic steps are detailed and logically sequenced, making the implementation approach easy to follow. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the Neural ODE parameters Î¸ and the actual system dynamics could be more explicitly defined - whether the Neural ODE is learning unknown dynamics or representing known dynamics; (2) Some technical details about computing the Wasserstein distance efficiently at scale could be elaborated further; (3) The adversarial perturbation mechanism could be explained with more concrete examples. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is strong, allowing readers to understand the proposed approach and its implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of Neural ODEs, Optimal Transport, and robust control principles. The OT-NODEC framework represents a fresh approach to handling distributional uncertainty in control systems by explicitly optimizing for distributional robustness using Wasserstein distances. The combination of Neural ODEs for dynamics modeling with OT-based objectives and adversarial training inspired by Distributionally Robust Optimization is innovative and distinguishes this work from prior approaches. The proposal builds upon existing literature (e.g., Scagliotti & Farinelli's work on OT maps via Neural ODEs) but extends it significantly by focusing on control policy learning rather than just distribution mapping. The integration of adversarial perturbations within an OT-based uncertainty set is particularly novel. While individual components (Neural ODEs, OT, adversarial training) exist in the literature, their specific combination and application to robust control policy learning represents a meaningful advancement. The proposal could have scored higher if it had proposed entirely new theoretical foundations rather than combining existing approaches, but the integration itself is sufficiently innovative to merit a high novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations from Optimal Transport, Neural ODEs, and control theory. The mathematical formulation is rigorous, with clear definitions of the system dynamics, control policy, and optimization objectives. The connection to Wasserstein distances and their role in measuring distributional differences is well-established. The algorithmic approach is logical and follows from the mathematical formulation. However, there are some areas where the soundness could be improved: (1) The proposal mentions theoretical analysis of stability and convergence but doesn't provide specific approaches or conditions under which these guarantees would hold; (2) The computational tractability of the Wasserstein distance calculation in high dimensions is acknowledged as challenging but not fully addressed; (3) The adversarial training approach is described at a high level, but the convergence properties of the minimax optimization are not thoroughly analyzed; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address how the Neural ODE integration errors might affect the control performance. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is well-grounded in established theory and the proposed methodology follows sound principles from both machine learning and control theory."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces several implementation challenges that affect its practicality. On the positive side, the proposal leverages existing tools and libraries (PyTorch, JAX, torchdiffeq, POT) and specifies concrete experimental settings (robotic manipulation, supply chain optimization) that are reasonable test beds. The algorithmic steps are detailed enough to guide implementation. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) Computing Wasserstein distances between high-dimensional distributions is computationally expensive, and while the proposal mentions using Sinkhorn iterations, scaling to complex control systems may be challenging; (2) The adversarial training approach requires solving inner maximization problems, which adds significant computational burden; (3) Backpropagation through ODE solvers for Neural ODEs is known to be memory-intensive, especially for long time horizons; (4) The proposal aims to simultaneously optimize dynamics models and control policies, which introduces additional complexity and potential training instabilities; (5) The theoretical analysis mentioned in the expected outcomes may be difficult to achieve given the complexity of the combined frameworks. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively suggest that full implementation of the proposal would require significant computational resources and potential simplifications or approximations to make it tractable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in control theory and machine learning: developing robust control policies that can handle distributional shifts and uncertainties. This is particularly relevant for real-world applications like robotics, autonomous systems, and supply chain management where environmental conditions and system parameters can vary significantly. The OT-NODEC framework offers a principled approach to quantifying and optimizing for distributional robustness, which could lead to more reliable controllers in practice. The integration of Optimal Transport with Neural ODEs and robust control principles provides a theoretically grounded framework that bridges multiple disciplines, aligning well with the workshop's goals. If successful, this research could significantly advance data-driven robust control by providing both practical algorithms and theoretical insights. The potential applications span multiple domains where handling uncertainty is critical. The proposal also addresses several open challenges identified in the literature review. While the immediate impact might be limited to academic and research settings due to implementation complexity, the long-term significance for advancing robust control methodologies is substantial."
