        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses multiple topics listed in the workshop call, including stochastic optimal control, stochastic processes, diffusion models, neural SDEs/ODEs, and has implications for reinforcement learning. The proposal specifically aims to bridge diffusion models with control theory for handling high-dimensional, nonlinear systems under uncertainty - which is at the core of the workshop's focus on the intersection between learning, control, and dynamical systems. The only minor limitation preventing a perfect score is that it doesn't explicitly address optimal transport, though the diffusion modeling approach implicitly relates to this topic."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a three-step framework that logically connects diffusion models to stochastic control. The motivation clearly establishes the limitations of traditional approaches and the potential benefits of the proposed method. The pipeline from learning neural SDEs to training diffusion models and then optimizing control sequences is well-articulated. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific cost functional formulation, how the diffusion model would be conditioned on control inputs, and the exact mechanism for sampling and evaluating diverse trajectories during optimization. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates exceptional novelty by proposing a fundamentally new integration of diffusion models with stochastic optimal control. While both diffusion models and stochastic control are established fields, their combination in this manner - particularly using diffusion models to generate future state trajectories conditioned on control inputs and then optimizing over these samples - represents a genuinely innovative approach. The framework leverages the strengths of generative modeling to address fundamental limitations in traditional control methods, especially regarding non-Gaussian uncertainties and multi-modal distributions. This integration of probabilistic inference and control through diffusion models is a fresh perspective that could open new research directions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The individual components (neural SDEs/ODEs, diffusion models, trajectory optimization) have established implementations, which supports feasibility. However, integrating these components into a cohesive control framework involves significant technical hurdles. Training diffusion models on trajectory data may require large datasets and computational resources. The optimization of control sequences by sampling from the diffusion model could be computationally intensive for real-time applications. Additionally, ensuring stability and convergence guarantees for the overall control system might be challenging. These considerations suggest the idea is implementable but would require substantial engineering effort and theoretical development."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is very high. If successful, it would address fundamental limitations in stochastic optimal control for complex, high-dimensional systems under uncertainty - a persistent challenge in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and financial systems. The ability to handle non-Gaussian noise distributions and partial observability would represent a major advancement over traditional approaches. The framework could enable more robust decision-making in critical applications where uncertainty quantification is essential. Furthermore, it contributes to the theoretical unification of probabilistic inference and control, potentially influencing multiple research communities. The broad applicability across domains and the potential to solve previously intractable control problems underscore its significance."
