        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description's focus on computational sustainability and the path from theory to deployment. It specifically addresses urban planning challenges using multi-agent reinforcement learning, which connects to the workshop's theme of balancing environmental, economic, and societal needs. The proposal includes a clear deployment pathway and acknowledges real-world challenges like multi-agent decision-making and data variability, which are highlighted in the task description. However, it could more explicitly address the 'pitfalls' aspect of the workshop theme and discuss potential failure modes or negative results that could be valuable to the community."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact. The five-step methodology provides a good roadmap for implementation. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific MARL algorithms to be used, how the agents will balance competing objectives, and how the simulation environment will be validated against real-world conditions. The transition from simulation to real-world deployment also needs more detailed explanation, as this is often a significant challenge in computational sustainability applications."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing techniques (computer vision, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent systems) in a way that is somewhat novel for urban planning applications. The multi-stakeholder approach with agents representing different interests is a strength. However, MARL has been applied to urban planning before, and the proposal doesn't clearly articulate what specific innovations it brings to the field. It doesn't mention how it improves upon or differs from existing MARL approaches in urban contexts. The research would benefit from identifying specific technical innovations or methodological advances that distinguish it from prior work in this area."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research faces several challenges. While the simulation component is likely achievable, the transition to real-world deployment raises significant concerns. Urban planning decisions involve complex political, social, and economic factors that are difficult to model. The proposal doesn't address how it will handle the gap between simulation and reality, or how it will validate its results in real-world settings. Data collection for such a comprehensive system would be resource-intensive, and the computational requirements for training multiple agents with competing objectives would be substantial. The timeline for implementation and deployment is also not specified, raising questions about the practical execution of the project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research addresses important sustainability challenges in urban planning, which aligns well with the UN SDGs mentioned in the task description. If successful, it could contribute meaningful tools for balancing environmental, economic, and societal needs in urban development. The multi-stakeholder approach is particularly valuable as it acknowledges the complex trade-offs in sustainability decisions. However, the proposal could more clearly articulate the specific sustainability metrics it aims to improve and quantify the expected impact. It also doesn't fully address how it will overcome the common pitfalls in computational sustainability that the workshop aims to highlight, such as low signal-to-noise ratios and changing conditions."
