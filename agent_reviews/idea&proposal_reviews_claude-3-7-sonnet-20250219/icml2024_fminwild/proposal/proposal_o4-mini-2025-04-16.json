    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the Workshop's question on reliability and responsibility by focusing on hallucination reduction in foundation models. The multi-level contrastive learning approach is consistent with the original idea, implementing token-level, statement-level, and source-reliability contrastive learning as proposed. The methodology incorporates retrieval-augmented generation as suggested in the literature review, citing relevant works like RAG-HAT and ReDeEP. The proposal also addresses practical limitations in deployment by designing a framework that minimizes computational overhead during inference. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions cross-modal representation alignment as a challenge, the proposal primarily focuses on text-based models, with multimodal extensions only briefly mentioned in future work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with detailed explanations of each component. The mathematical formulations of the three contrastive losses are precisely defined with appropriate notation. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is comprehensively outlined. The algorithmic steps provide a clear implementation roadmap. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for identifying factual vs. hallucinated tokens in training data could be more explicitly described; (2) the relationship between the retrieval component and the contrastive losses could be further elaborated; and (3) some technical details about the integration of the three contrastive losses during training (e.g., gradient balancing) are not fully specified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a multi-level contrastive learning framework that operates at token, statement, and source levels simultaneously. This integrated approach differs from existing methods like Iter-AHMCL, which focuses on model-level contrastive learning, or RAG-HAT, which emphasizes post-hoc detection and correction. The combination of three distinct contrastive objectives within a retrieval-augmented framework represents a fresh perspective. However, each individual component draws from existing techniques in the literature: token-level contrastive learning has been explored in representation learning, statement-level verification appears in fact-checking research, and source-reliability alignment is common in retrieval-augmented generation. The novelty lies in their integration rather than in fundamentally new algorithmic innovations. The proposal acknowledges related work appropriately but could more explicitly differentiate its approach from Hallucination Augmented Contrastive Learning (Jiang et al., 2023), which also uses contrastive learning for hallucination reduction."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on well-established theoretical foundations. The contrastive learning objectives are properly formulated using standard loss functions (InfoNCE, margin ranking) with appropriate mathematical notation. The integration with retrieval-augmented generation follows established practices in the field. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contribution of each component. However, there are a few areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in balancing the multiple loss terms during optimization; (2) there's limited discussion of how to handle cases where retrieved evidence might itself contain errors or contradictions; and (3) while the approach to constructing the hallucination dataset is outlined, the quality control measures to ensure reliable annotation of factual vs. hallucinated content could be more detailed. Overall, the methodology is well-justified and technically correct, with only minor gaps in addressing potential implementation challenges."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it requires moderate resources and refinement. The implementation builds on established components: transformer-based foundation models, retrieval systems, and contrastive learning techniques. The data collection strategy leverages existing benchmarks (TruthfulQA, FEVER) supplemented with synthetic data generation, which is practical. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined and implementable. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) creating high-quality annotated datasets with token-level hallucination labels may be labor-intensive and potentially subjective; (2) the computational requirements for training with three contrastive objectives plus retrieval augmentation could be substantial, especially for larger foundation models; (3) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully detail how to handle domain adaptation across diverse fields like healthcare, legal, and finance; and (4) the real-time retrieval component may introduce latency issues in deployment scenarios with strict response time requirements. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and reasonable resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in foundation model deployment: hallucination reduction. This issue is particularly important in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal advice, and finance, where factual accuracy is essential. The expected outcomes—20% reduction in hallucination rates and 10% improvement in factual accuracy—would represent meaningful progress in the field. The approach is designed to be integrated into existing RAG pipelines, enhancing its practical impact. The multi-level framework could potentially influence how foundation models are fine-tuned for factuality across various applications. The proposal directly addresses the Workshop's questions on reliability, responsibility, and practical limitations in deployment. However, while the impact would be significant, it may not be transformative in the sense of completely solving the hallucination problem or fundamentally changing how foundation models operate. The approach is an important step forward rather than a paradigm shift. The significance is also somewhat limited by the focus on text-based models, with multimodal applications only mentioned as future work."
