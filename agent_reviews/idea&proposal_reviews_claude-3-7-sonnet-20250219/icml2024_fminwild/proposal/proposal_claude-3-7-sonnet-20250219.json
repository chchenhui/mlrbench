    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on foundation models in the wild, particularly the reliability challenges highlighted in the task description. The multi-level contrastive learning framework thoroughly expands on the initial idea, maintaining the three-level approach (token, statement, and source-reliability) while adding comprehensive implementation details. The proposal also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation as mentioned in the literature review, showing awareness of current approaches. The methodology addresses hallucination detection and mitigation, which is identified as a key challenge in the literature review. The proposal's focus on real-world applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal services aligns perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on real-world adaptation and reliability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding rather than obscuring it. The three levels of contrastive learning are distinctly defined with clear objectives and implementation strategies. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-specified models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact process for creating the hallucination dataset could be more detailed, particularly regarding quality control for human annotations; (2) the integration between the three levels of contrastive learning could be more explicitly explained; and (3) some of the mathematical notation could be more consistently defined across sections."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a multi-level contrastive learning approach to hallucination reduction. While contrastive learning itself is not new (as evidenced by papers in the literature review like 'Hallucination Augmented Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Large Language Model'), the application at three distinct levels (token, statement, and source-reliability) represents a fresh perspective. The integration of these levels with retrieval-augmented generation also shows innovation. However, the approach shares similarities with existing work like Iter-AHMCL mentioned in the literature review, which also uses contrastive learning to address hallucinations. The source-reliability level appears to be the most novel contribution, as it explicitly addresses information provenance, which is less explored in the cited literature. Overall, while not entirely groundbreaking, the proposal offers a meaningful extension and novel combination of existing techniques."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-formulated mathematical expressions and a rigorous approach to the problem. The contrastive learning framework is built on established principles with clear loss functions for each level. The integration with retrieval-augmented generation is technically sound and builds on proven approaches. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies to validate the contribution of each component. The proposal also acknowledges limitations and potential challenges, showing awareness of technical constraints. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical justification for why this approach would reduce hallucinations could be more deeply explored; (2) the hyperparameter selection process is stated but not fully justified; and (3) while the mathematical formulations are generally correct, some assumptions about the availability and quality of reference embeddings could be more thoroughly examined."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation steps. The data collection strategy combines human annotation, model-assisted generation, and real-world examples, which is practical though potentially resource-intensive. The computational requirements seem reasonable for research purposes, with standard batch sizes, learning rates, and training epochs. The evaluation methodology is well-defined and implementable using existing benchmarks and metrics. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) creating a high-quality dataset of 10,000 paired factual/hallucinated examples with expert annotation could be time-consuming and expensive; (2) the source-reliability contrastive learning requires reliable source ratings, which might be subjective or difficult to obtain at scale; (3) the integration of three different contrastive learning levels might require significant hyperparameter tuning to balance effectively. Despite these challenges, the overall approach appears implementable with sufficient resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI deployment: hallucinations in foundation models. This issue directly impacts trust, safety, and utility of AI systems in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal services, and education. The expected outcomes of 40-60% reduction in hallucination rates would represent a substantial improvement over current approaches. The framework's focus on maintaining generation capabilities while reducing hallucinations addresses a key trade-off in current methods. The computational efficiency aspect is particularly significant for real-world deployment, aligning with the workshop's focus on practical limitations. The broader impact section convincingly argues for the societal benefits of more reliable AI systems. The proposal's significance is enhanced by its potential transferability across model architectures and domains. While the impact could be transformative if successful, the actual significance will depend on empirical validation of the claimed hallucination reduction rates and computational efficiency."
