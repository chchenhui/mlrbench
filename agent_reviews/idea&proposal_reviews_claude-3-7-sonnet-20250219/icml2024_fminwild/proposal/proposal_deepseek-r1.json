    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild's focus on reliability and responsibility, particularly the issue of hallucinations mentioned in the task description. The multi-level contrastive learning framework follows the exact structure outlined in the research idea, implementing token-level, statement-level, and source-reliability contrastive learning as proposed. The methodology thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing and building upon works like Iter-AHMCL, ReDeEP, and RAG-HAT. The proposal also addresses real-world deployment considerations such as computational efficiency and domain-specific applications (healthcare, finance), which aligns with the workshop's emphasis on practical limitations in deployment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the multi-level contrastive learning framework is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The integration with RAG systems is well-defined, and the experimental design includes specific baselines, evaluation metrics, and domains. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for the revision process when tokens have reliability scores below threshold β could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the three levels of contrastive learning could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., NT-Xent loss) are used without definition, which might be unclear to readers unfamiliar with contrastive learning techniques."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a multi-level contrastive learning framework that operates at three distinct granularities (token, statement, and source-reliability levels). This integrated approach differentiates it from existing works like Iter-AHMCL, which focuses on model-level contrastive learning, or RAG-HAT, which emphasizes hallucination-aware tuning. The integration of these three levels into a unified framework with a combined loss function represents a fresh perspective. However, each individual component builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. For instance, token-level and statement-level contrastive learning are established approaches in representation learning, and the source-reliability component shares similarities with existing RAG frameworks. While the proposal combines these elements in a novel way, it represents an evolutionary rather than revolutionary advancement in the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-formulated mathematical expressions for each component of the multi-level contrastive learning framework. The loss functions are properly defined, and the integration with RAG systems is technically coherent. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The methodology is grounded in established contrastive learning principles and builds upon solid theoretical foundations from the literature. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the hyperparameter selection process for balancing the loss components (λ1, λ2, λ3) is not fully explained, (2) the potential interactions or conflicts between the three levels of contrastive learning are not thoroughly addressed, and (3) while the proposal mentions a hybrid dataset combining synthetic and real-world examples, the specific data generation and annotation processes could be more rigorously defined to ensure quality and representativeness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The contrastive learning framework builds upon established techniques, and the integration with RAG systems leverages existing infrastructure. The expected outcome of \"latency <500ms per query\" suggests consideration of real-world deployment constraints. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Creating a high-quality hybrid dataset with domain-specific annotations from experts in healthcare and finance may require significant resources and time; (2) The computational requirements for training with three different contrastive losses simultaneously could be substantial; (3) The real-time verification mechanism during inference might introduce latency challenges beyond the stated 500ms target, especially for complex queries; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle potential conflicts between the three levels of contrastive learning during optimization. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they represent notable hurdles that would require careful management and potentially additional resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in foundation model deployment: hallucination reduction in high-stakes domains. This directly aligns with the Workshop on FMs in the Wild's focus on reliability and responsibility. The expected outcome of a \"10-20% reduction in hallucination rates\" would represent a meaningful advancement in making foundation models more trustworthy for real-world applications. The focus on healthcare and finance domains further enhances the significance, as these are areas where factual accuracy is paramount. The proposal also contributes methodologically by introducing a multi-level approach to hallucination reduction that could influence future research directions. Additionally, the creation of a hybrid hallucination dataset would benefit the broader research community. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the advancement (building on existing contrastive learning and RAG techniques) and the focus on specific domains rather than a universal solution for all deployment scenarios."
