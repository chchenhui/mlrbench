    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, particularly addressing the second question about reliability and responsibility in foundation models. The proposal directly tackles hallucination reduction and privacy preservation, which are explicitly mentioned in the workshop's focus areas. The idea also touches on practical limitations in deployment (question 4) by considering computational overhead and implementation feasibility. The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively address adaptation to specific domains (question 1) or broader societal fairness concerns (question 3), though privacy protection does relate to ethical considerations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main components, and expected outcomes. The two-part framework (uncertainty-aware confidence scoring and privacy-sensitive prompting) is distinctly explained with specific technical approaches mentioned (Bayesian neural networks, ensemble-based variance metrics, entity recognition models). However, some implementation details remain somewhat abstract - for instance, how exactly the confidence thresholds would be determined or how the privacy filter would be trained. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score, but overall the proposal communicates its concepts effectively."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining two important aspects of FM reliability - uncertainty estimation and privacy preservation - into a unified framework. While neither uncertainty quantification nor privacy filters are entirely new concepts in machine learning, their specific integration for foundation model deployment represents a fresh approach. The hybrid nature of using retrieval augmentation triggered by uncertainty metrics is innovative. However, the individual components build upon existing techniques (Bayesian neural networks, differential privacy, entity recognition) rather than proposing fundamentally new methods, which limits the highest novelty rating."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Both uncertainty estimation and privacy-preserving techniques have established implementations that could be adapted for this purpose. The proposal wisely suggests lightweight approaches to minimize computational overhead, making practical deployment realistic. The retrieval component would require domain-specific knowledge bases, which exist in many fields. The main implementation challenges would likely be in calibrating uncertainty thresholds effectively and ensuring the privacy filters don't overly restrict useful information, but these are manageable engineering tasks rather than fundamental barriers."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses critical problems in foundation model deployment that currently limit their adoption in high-stakes domains. Hallucinations and privacy concerns are among the most pressing issues facing foundation models in real-world applications. The potential impact is substantial across multiple sectors including healthcare, finance, and legal applications where both accuracy and privacy are paramount. By focusing on practical deployment challenges rather than just theoretical improvements, the research could bridge the gap between academic advances and real-world implementation. The dual focus on both reliability and privacy makes this particularly significant as most approaches tackle only one of these challenges."
