        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the central theme of the workshop on representational alignment by developing a framework to quantify and enhance alignment between biological and artificial systems. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the development of invariant feature spaces using domain adaptation techniques (adversarial and contrastive learning) to align representations across disparate domains. It builds upon the literature review by extending methods like CDA and CDCL, addressing challenges such as data modality differences and false negatives in contrastive learning. The proposal also addresses most of the workshop questions, particularly focusing on developing robust alignment measures, understanding shared computational strategies, and systematically modifying alignment between systems."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The methodology section provides a comprehensive explanation of the Invariant Feature Alignment Networks (IFANs) framework, including domain-specific encoders, adversarial domain alignment, contrastive class alignment, and behavioral congruence objectives. The evaluation metrics and baselines for comparison are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the behavioral congruence objective and the overall alignment framework could be more explicitly connected, (2) some technical details about the implementation of the adversarial-contrastive architecture could be elaborated further, and (3) the pseudo-labeling process could be explained in more detail."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining multiple existing techniques (adversarial learning, contrastive learning, and behavioral congruence) into a unified framework specifically designed for cross-domain representational alignment. The hybrid adversarial-contrastive architecture with a behavioral congruence objective represents a fresh approach to the problem. The focus on aligning representations between biological and artificial systems, particularly with mismatched data modalities, is innovative. However, the core technical components (adversarial domain adaptation and contrastive learning) are adaptations of existing methods like CDA and CDCL mentioned in the literature review. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches. The behavioral congruence objective adds novelty, but the overall framework builds incrementally on established domain adaptation techniques rather than introducing a completely new paradigm."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The mathematical formulations for the adversarial loss, contrastive loss, and behavioral congruence objective are correctly presented and justified. The approach builds on established domain adaptation techniques from the literature review and extends them appropriately for the cross-domain representational alignment task. The evaluation metrics (CCA, Procrustes Analysis, Invariance Ratio) are appropriate for measuring alignment. The training protocol and hyperparameter search strategy are well-defined. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges like false negative mitigation and provides solutions. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the theoretical guarantees for convergence of the adversarial-contrastive framework are not fully addressed, (2) the mutual information estimation for the Invariance Ratio metric might be challenging in practice and deserves more discussion, and (3) the statistical significance of the proposed behavioral congruence measures could be more thoroughly justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The methodology leverages existing techniques (adversarial and contrastive learning) that have been successfully implemented in prior work, suggesting that the core components are implementable. The evaluation metrics and baselines are well-established and accessible. However, there are several feasibility challenges: (1) obtaining paired datasets across biological and artificial systems (e.g., fMRI data and CNN activations for the same stimuli) may be resource-intensive and require specialized expertise, (2) the adversarial training process can be unstable and may require careful tuning to converge properly, (3) the computational resources needed for the proposed hyperparameter search could be substantial, and (4) the behavioral congruence objective assumes access to paired behavioral data, which may not always be available. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the proposal impractical, but rather suggest that successful implementation would require careful planning and potentially some adjustments to the methodology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in the field of representational alignment with potentially high impact. Successfully developing a domain-agnostic framework for quantifying alignment between biological and artificial systems would advance our understanding of shared computational principles and facilitate the design of more interpretable and human-aligned AI systems. The expected outcomes include both technical advancements (domain-agnostic alignment metric, intervention tools) and scientific insights (shared feature spaces, behavioral bridges), which could benefit researchers across machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science. The societal impact section highlights meaningful applications in medical AI and explainable AI. The proposal directly addresses the central questions of the workshop, particularly regarding when and why intelligent systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. However, while the potential impact is substantial, the proposal could more explicitly discuss how the framework would lead to transformative changes in our understanding of intelligence or in the development of AI systems that fundamentally change how we approach human-AI collaboration."
