    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the central theme of the workshop on representational alignment, focusing on when and why intelligence systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposal incorporates the domain adaptation techniques mentioned in the literature review (adversarial training, contrastive learning) and cites relevant works. It specifically targets the workshop question about developing 'more robust and generalizable measures of alignment that work across different domains and types of representations.' The methodology section clearly outlines how the invariant feature spaces concept from the research idea will be implemented, and the expected outcomes align with both the task requirements and the original idea. The only minor inconsistency is that some of the references in the proposal don't match exactly with those in the literature review, but the core concepts and approaches are consistent."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated in a logical and coherent manner. The algorithmic steps are broken down into clear stages with specific techniques identified for each step. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and motivation. The methodology section provides a detailed roadmap for implementation, with specific techniques mentioned for each stage. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further elaboration: (1) The exact mathematical formulation of the proposed alignment metric is not fully specified; (2) The validation approach could be more detailed regarding specific experiments and datasets; and (3) Some technical terms (e.g., 'gradient reversal layer') are mentioned without explanation, which might be unclear to readers unfamiliar with domain adaptation techniques. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is well-articulated and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in its approach to representational alignment. While domain adaptation techniques like adversarial training and contrastive learning are established methods (as evidenced in the literature review), their application to the specific problem of cross-domain representational alignment between biological and artificial systems represents a novel direction. The idea of creating invariant feature spaces to compare representations across drastically different domains (e.g., fMRI vs. deep network activations) is innovative. The proposal also introduces the novel concept of validating alignment through behavioral congruence, which goes beyond traditional evaluation metrics in domain adaptation. However, the individual components (adversarial training, contrastive learning, autoencoders) are well-established techniques, and the proposal primarily combines these existing methods rather than developing fundamentally new algorithms. The novelty lies more in the application domain and the overall framework rather than in the technical approaches themselves."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. It draws appropriately from domain adaptation literature, including adversarial training and contrastive learning approaches that have proven effective in related contexts. The multi-stage methodology follows a logical progression from data collection to validation. The evaluation metrics are appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The proposal lacks detailed mathematical formulations of the proposed methods; (2) There is limited discussion of potential failure modes or theoretical limitations of the approach; (3) The connection between representational alignment and behavioral congruence is assumed rather than theoretically justified; and (4) The proposal does not thoroughly address how to handle the significant differences in dimensionality and structure between biological and artificial representations. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and based on well-established techniques in the field."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the technical components (adversarial training, contrastive learning, autoencoders) are established methods with available implementations, and the multi-stage approach allows for incremental progress. However, several significant challenges affect feasibility: (1) Obtaining and preprocessing appropriate paired datasets from biological and artificial systems is non-trivial and may require specialized expertise and resources; (2) Aligning fundamentally different data modalities (e.g., fMRI vs. neural network activations) presents substantial technical challenges that may not be fully addressed by standard domain adaptation techniques; (3) The validation approach requires demonstrating correlation between alignment scores and behavioral congruence, which depends on having appropriate behavioral measures for both biological and artificial systems; (4) The proposal does not include a clear timeline or resource allocation plan; and (5) The scope is quite broad, potentially requiring expertise across multiple disciplines (neuroscience, machine learning, cognitive science). While the research is technically possible, these challenges suggest moderate feasibility that would require significant resources and expertise to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the field of AI and cognitive science. Developing methods to align and compare representations across different domains (biological and artificial) could have substantial impact on our understanding of intelligence and the development of more human-like AI systems. The research directly addresses a fundamental challenge identified in the workshop description: the lack of appropriate ways to compare and align representations across intelligent systems. If successful, the outcomes would contribute to multiple workshop questions, particularly around developing robust cross-domain alignment measures and understanding shared computational strategies. The potential applications are broad, including improving AI systems through better alignment with human cognition, advancing neuroscientific understanding of representation, and enabling more effective human-AI interaction. The interdisciplinary nature of the work could foster collaboration across machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science communities. While the immediate practical applications might be limited to research contexts rather than deployed systems, the long-term significance for advancing our theoretical understanding and guiding future AI development is substantial."
