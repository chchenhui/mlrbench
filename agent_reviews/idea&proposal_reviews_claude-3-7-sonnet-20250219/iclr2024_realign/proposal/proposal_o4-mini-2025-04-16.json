    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of understanding when and why intelligent systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposal incorporates the dual-encoder architecture with adversarial and contrastive objectives as outlined in the research idea, and builds upon the domain adaptation techniques mentioned in the literature review (CDA, contrastive learning for domain adaptation). The methodology section thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as data modality differences, class-conditional shift, and false negatives in contrastive learning. The proposal also explicitly targets the workshop questions about measuring alignment across different domains and types of representations, and investigating the extent to which representational alignment indicates shared computational strategies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate mathematical formulations. The dual-encoder architecture, loss functions, and training algorithm are all well-defined. The experimental design, including datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for avoiding false negatives in the contrastive loss could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the learned invariant feature space and the proposed alignment score could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the gradient reversal layer in the adversarial training could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining adversarial domain confusion with contrastive learning specifically for cross-domain representational alignment between biological and artificial systems. While the individual components (adversarial training, contrastive learning) are drawn from existing domain adaptation literature, their application to the specific problem of aligning neural and artificial representations is innovative. The proposal extends beyond prior work by addressing the unique challenges of cross-modal alignment (e.g., fMRI vs. model activations) rather than just cross-domain adaptation within the same modality. The introduction of a domain-agnostic alignment metric computed in the shared space is a fresh perspective. However, the core technical approach still largely builds upon established domain adaptation techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic innovations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods from domain adaptation and representation learning. The mathematical formulations for the contrastive loss, adversarial domain confusion, and evaluation metrics are correct and clearly presented. The approach logically builds upon the literature review, addressing the identified challenges in cross-domain alignment. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines (RSA, CKA, Procrustes) and evaluation metrics that directly measure the quality of the learned alignments. The proposal also includes ablation studies to assess the contribution of different components. The training algorithm is well-specified and feasible. One minor concern is that the proposal could benefit from a more detailed theoretical analysis of why the proposed approach should overcome the limitations of existing alignment metrics, but overall, the technical foundations are solid."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The dual-encoder architecture and adversarial/contrastive training are well-established techniques that can be implemented with current deep learning frameworks. The datasets mentioned (BrainScore benchmarks, fMRI/MEG responses) are available, though accessing and preprocessing neuroimaging data may require specialized expertise. The timeline is reasonable, allocating sufficient time for data collection, model development, and evaluation. However, there are some practical challenges: (1) aligning very different data modalities (e.g., sparse, noisy fMRI data with dense neural network activations) may be more difficult than standard domain adaptation scenarios, (2) the quality of the alignment may depend heavily on the amount and quality of matched pairs across domains, and (3) the computational resources required for training on large-scale neuroimaging and model activation datasets could be substantial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in understanding the relationship between biological and artificial intelligence systems. If successful, the framework would provide a robust, scalable method for quantifying alignment across disparate domains, which could have far-reaching implications for both neuroscience and AI development. The potential outcomes include: (1) advancing fundamental understanding of shared computational principles across biological and artificial systems, (2) providing neuroscientists with tools to test computational theories against deep model activations, (3) offering engineers methods to incorporate neural constraints into AI training, potentially improving generalization and interpretability, and (4) enabling systematic interventions to increase alignment between human and AI representations. These contributions directly address the workshop's central questions and could significantly impact multiple fields, including neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning."
