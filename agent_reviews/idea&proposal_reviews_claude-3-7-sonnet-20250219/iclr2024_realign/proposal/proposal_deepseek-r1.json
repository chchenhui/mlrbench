    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central theme of understanding when and why intelligent systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, developing a framework for invariant feature spaces to quantify alignment between representations from disparate domains. It also thoroughly integrates insights from the literature review, specifically leveraging techniques like adversarial training and contrastive learning mentioned in the cited papers (CDA, CDCL). The proposal addresses all five key challenges identified in the literature review: data modality differences, class-conditional distribution shifts, lack of labeled data (through pseudo-labeling), false negatives in contrastive learning (through the two-stage approach), and scalability/generalization (through domain-agnostic design). The only minor inconsistency is that while the task description emphasizes both increasing and decreasing alignment, the proposal focuses primarily on increasing alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the algorithmic framework is presented with mathematical precision, including formal definitions of the adversarial and contrastive losses. The experimental validation section clearly outlines benchmark tasks, evaluation metrics, and baselines. The proposal effectively communicates complex technical concepts using appropriate terminology and notation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the adversarial domain alignment and contrastive feature refinement could be more explicitly explained, (2) the pseudo-labeling process could be elaborated further, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the feature extractor F are not fully specified. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by integrating and extending existing techniques in a new context. While individual components like adversarial training, contrastive learning, and pseudo-labeling have been explored in domain adaptation literature (as cited), their combination and application to the specific problem of aligning biological and artificial neural representations is innovative. The two-stage contrastive learning approach that mitigates false negatives builds upon but extends Thota & Leontidis (2021). The proposal's focus on using alignment scores to predict behavioral congruence is a fresh perspective not commonly explored in the literature. However, the core technical approaches are adaptations of existing methods rather than fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal would benefit from more explicit articulation of how its approach differs from or improves upon the cited works like CDA and CDCL beyond applying them to a new domain. Overall, while not groundbreaking in its methodological approach, the proposal offers a novel integration and application of existing techniques to an important interdisciplinary problem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The adversarial and contrastive learning approaches are mathematically well-formulated with proper loss functions. The two-stage contrastive learning approach to address false negatives is theoretically justified. The evaluation metrics (alignment score, behavioral congruence, error pattern similarity) are appropriate for the research objectives. The proposal also shows awareness of potential limitations by including baseline comparisons with established methods like CCA and RSA. The pseudo-labeling approach for unsupervised adaptation is grounded in prior work (Wang et al., 2021). The experimental design includes appropriate datasets for both vision and language domains. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the proposal could provide more theoretical justification for why the learned invariant space would preserve task-relevant information, (2) there's limited discussion of potential failure modes or robustness analyses, and (3) the expected improvement metrics (â‰¥15% in cross-domain similarity, 10-20% performance improvement) could benefit from more rigorous justification. Despite these minor concerns, the overall approach is technically sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components, but has some implementation challenges. On the positive side: (1) it uses existing datasets (Natural Scenes Dataset, ImageNet) and models (ResNet, ViT, GPT-4, BERT), (2) the algorithmic components (adversarial training, contrastive learning) have established implementations, and (3) the evaluation metrics are computationally tractable. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) obtaining and processing neuroimaging data (fMRI, EEG) requires specialized expertise and resources, (2) aligning stimuli between biological and artificial systems is non-trivial, especially for language tasks, (3) the computational resources required for training large models like GPT-4 are substantial, and (4) the two-stage contrastive learning with false negative mitigation may be complex to implement effectively. The proposal doesn't fully address practical challenges like hyperparameter tuning across different domains or the computational complexity of the framework. While ambitious, the research is implementable with appropriate resources and expertise, though it may require more time and computational power than implied."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in understanding intelligence across biological and artificial systems, with far-reaching implications. Its significance is evident in multiple dimensions: (1) Scientific impact: The framework could provide crucial insights into universal computational principles across different forms of intelligence, potentially unifying theories across neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI. (2) Methodological advancement: The proposed domain-agnostic alignment metric would enable more robust comparisons between disparate systems than current methods like CCA and RSA. (3) Practical applications: The framework could improve AI systems through neural-guided training, enhance brain-computer interfaces, and address AI safety concerns through better alignment with human cognition. (4) Interdisciplinary bridge: The work directly addresses the workshop's goal of bringing together machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science. The proposal's focus on both understanding alignment and developing interventions to modify it is particularly valuable. The expected outcomes are ambitious but would represent significant advances in the field if achieved. The proposal convincingly articulates both theoretical and practical impacts across multiple disciplines."
