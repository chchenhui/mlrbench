        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the central theme of the Re-Align workshop by focusing on when and why systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposal incorporates the key questions from the workshop, particularly developing more robust and generalizable measures of alignment across different domains. The methodology leverages domain adaptation techniques (adversarial and contrastive learning) as suggested in the research idea, and thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, including data modality differences, distribution shifts, lack of labeled data, false negatives in contrastive learning, and scalability concerns. The proposal cites and builds upon the papers mentioned in the literature review, showing a deep understanding of the current state of research."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The conceptual framework is explained thoroughly with appropriate mathematical formulations that help understand the approach. The hybrid contrastive-adversarial domain adaptation method is described in detail, including the objective functions and training procedure. The experimental design and validation approach are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact procedure for handling false negatives could be more explicitly detailed, (2) the relationship between the learned invariant space and behavioral congruence could be further elaborated, and (3) some of the mathematical notations, while correct, might be challenging for readers without a strong background in domain adaptation techniques."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel approach to representational alignment by combining adversarial and contrastive learning techniques specifically for cross-domain alignment between biological and artificial systems. While the individual components (adversarial domain adaptation, contrastive learning) are based on existing methods from the literature, their integration and application to the specific problem of representational alignment across biological and artificial systems is innovative. The proposal extends beyond simply applying these techniques by developing a new framework for measuring alignment in the learned invariant space and connecting this to behavioral congruence. However, the core technical approach is largely a synthesis of existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms, which somewhat limits its novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of the hybrid contrastive-adversarial approach is sound, with clear objective functions and training procedures. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and validation approaches. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and outlines strategies to address them. The connection between representational alignment and behavioral congruence provides a solid validation framework. The approach is well-grounded in domain adaptation literature and addresses the identified challenges systematically. The only minor concerns are: (1) the potential instability of adversarial training is acknowledged but could be addressed more thoroughly, and (2) the assumption that domain-invariant features will preserve task-relevant information might not always hold and could benefit from additional theoretical justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The datasets mentioned (THINGS, Algonauts, etc.) are publicly available, and the proposed models build on established techniques in domain adaptation. The experimental design is practical and includes appropriate evaluation metrics. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) the extensive hyperparameter tuning required for the hybrid approach might be computationally expensive, (2) the stability issues in adversarial training could lead to convergence problems, (3) obtaining and processing neuroimaging data (fMRI, ECoG) requires specialized expertise and resources, and (4) establishing a meaningful correlation between alignment in the invariant space and behavioral congruence might be challenging given the complexity of both biological and artificial systems. While these challenges are acknowledged in the proposal, they do represent significant hurdles to full implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in comparing representations across different types of intelligent systems, which is central to advancing our understanding of both biological and artificial intelligence. If successful, this research would provide: (1) a more robust and generalizable framework for measuring alignment across domains, addressing a key question from the workshop; (2) insights into shared computational principles between biological and artificial systems; (3) methods for systematically manipulating alignment, enabling new research directions; and (4) potential applications in brain-computer interfaces, AI safety, and transfer learning. The work bridges multiple disciplines (ML, neuroscience, cognitive science) and could significantly impact how we understand and design intelligent systems. The connection to behavioral congruence adds practical significance beyond theoretical alignment measures. The proposal directly addresses all the key questions posed in the Re-Align workshop, making it highly relevant to the field."
