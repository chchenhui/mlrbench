        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the workshop's focus on representational alignment between intelligent systems. It directly addresses the question of 'How can we develop more robust and generalizable measures of alignment that work across different domains and types of representations?' by proposing dynamic alignment metrics for multimodal systems. The idea also touches on when and why systems learn aligned representations through its reinforcement learning approach. However, it doesn't fully address all aspects of the workshop's questions, particularly those related to biological systems and the implications of increasing/decreasing alignment, which is why it doesn't receive a perfect score."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The proposal to combine deep learning and reinforcement learning for dynamic alignment metrics is understandable. However, there are some ambiguities that prevent a higher score. For instance, the specific neural network architecture is not detailed, the exact reinforcement learning approach is not specified, and the definition of 'alignment scores' could be more precise. Additionally, the proposal could benefit from concrete examples of how the framework would adapt to changing data and modalities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea of dynamic representational alignment metrics that adapt to changing environments and multimodal data represents a fresh approach in this field. Most existing alignment metrics are static and don't account for evolving representations. The combination of deep learning for prediction and reinforcement learning for optimization in this context appears innovative. However, the individual components (neural networks, reinforcement learning) are well-established techniques, and similar approaches may have been explored in related domains, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces several implementation challenges. Training a neural network to predict alignment scores requires substantial labeled data on what constitutes 'good' alignment, which may be difficult to obtain. The reinforcement learning component needs well-defined reward signals for alignment quality, which is non-trivial to formulate. Additionally, ensuring that the system works across 'various domains and data types' is ambitious and may require significant computational resources and domain expertise. While the core approach is technically possible with current methods, these practical hurdles reduce its immediate feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "If successful, this research could significantly impact how we understand and facilitate communication between different intelligent systems. Dynamic alignment metrics would be valuable for human-AI interaction, multi-agent systems, and cross-modal learning. The work addresses a fundamental challenge in AI research and could enable more robust systems that adapt to changing environments. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of multimodal systems in real-world applications. However, the proposal could more explicitly connect to broader implications for cognitive science and neuroscience to fully align with the workshop's interdisciplinary focus."
