        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses the central theme of the workshop by proposing a framework to measure and enhance alignment between different intelligent systems. It specifically tackles the question of 'How can we develop more robust and generalizable measures of alignment that work across different domains and types of representations?' which is explicitly mentioned in the task. The idea also touches on understanding shared computational principles between biological and artificial systems, which aligns with the question about the extent to which representational alignment indicates shared computational strategies. The proposal aims to systematically increase alignment through contrastive learning, addressing another key workshop question."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The technical approach using Siamese networks and contrastive learning is specified, and the domains of application (fMRI, CNN activations, LLM embeddings) are clearly identified. However, there are some ambiguities that prevent a higher score. For instance, the exact implementation details of the domain adversarial training are not fully elaborated. The proposal could benefit from more specificity about how the 'structural similarities' will be defined across such diverse domains, and how the method will handle the vastly different dimensionalities and statistical properties of the various data types."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by proposing a unified framework for cross-domain representational alignment. While contrastive learning and Siamese networks are established techniques, their application to create a domain-agnostic alignment metric that works across biological and artificial systems represents a novel contribution. The combination of contrastive learning with domain adversarial training specifically for alignment metrics appears to be innovative. The cross-disciplinary nature of the approach, spanning neuroscience and multiple AI domains, adds to its novelty. However, similar approaches have been used for cross-modal representation learning within AI, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposed approach faces several implementation challenges. While the individual components (Siamese networks, contrastive learning, domain adversarial training) are established techniques, integrating them to work effectively across dramatically different domains like fMRI data and LLM embeddings presents significant difficulties. The proposal doesn't address how to handle the vastly different sampling rates, noise characteristics, and structural properties of these diverse data types. Additionally, obtaining paired or comparable data across these domains for training the alignment metric would be challenging. The computational resources required for processing neuroimaging data alongside deep learning models could be substantial. These challenges don't make the idea infeasible, but they do require considerable effort and expertise across multiple disciplines."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in understanding both biological and artificial intelligence. If successful, it could have profound impacts across multiple fields. In neuroscience, it could enhance brain decoding and provide new insights into neural computation. For AI, it could lead to more interpretable and human-aligned models. The cross-disciplinary nature of the work could bridge traditionally separate research communities. The potential applications mentioned (cross-species neural comparison, model-brain alignment, and cross-modal AI system interoperability) are all significant research directions with practical implications. The work directly addresses the growing need for better alignment metrics as AI systems become more complex and widespread, making it highly relevant to current research priorities."
