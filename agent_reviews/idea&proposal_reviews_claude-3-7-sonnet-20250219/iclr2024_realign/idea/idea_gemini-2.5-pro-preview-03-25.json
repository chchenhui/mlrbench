        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses the central question of 'how can scientists and engineers intervene on representational alignment?' by proposing a specific method for targeted representational sculpting. It also explicitly tackles the workshop question 'How can we systematically increase (or decrease) representational alignment among biological and artificial systems?' by offering a gradient-based approach to precisely modify alignment between neural networks or between neural networks and brain data. The idea is highly relevant to the workshop's focus on representational alignment across machine learning and neuroscience."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea is presented clearly with a well-defined approach. It articulates the problem (controlling representational similarity), proposes a specific solution (using alignment gradients for targeted parameter updates), and outlines the expected benefits. The technical components are well-specified, including the use of differentiable alignment objectives and low-rank or sparse parameter updates. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as the specific alignment metrics beyond centered kernel alignment that might be suitable, and more concrete examples of how the method would be implemented in practice across different domains."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a new way. While gradient-based optimization, representational similarity measures, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (like low-rank adaptation) exist separately, their integration for targeted representational alignment control appears to be a fresh approach. The concept of 'representational sculpting' that minimally impacts task performance while modifying alignment is innovative. However, it builds upon established methods in representation learning and alignment rather than introducing entirely new fundamental concepts, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is highly feasible with current technology and methods. All the components mentioned (alignment metrics, gradient computation, parameter-efficient fine-tuning) are well-established in the field and readily implementable. The computational requirements seem reasonable, especially since the method explicitly aims to be more efficient than full fine-tuning. The approach is mathematically sound, leveraging standard gradient-based optimization. The main implementation challenges would likely be in determining the right balance between alignment objectives and task performance, but these are manageable research questions rather than fundamental barriers to implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This idea addresses an important problem in the field of representational alignment with potentially broad impact. If successful, it would provide a valuable tool for researchers in both machine learning and neuroscience to systematically study and control representational alignment. The ability to precisely modify alignment while preserving task performance could advance our understanding of the relationship between representations and behavior, a core question in the workshop. The method could have practical applications in model interpretability, brain-computer interfaces, and model merging. The significance is high because it offers a concrete methodology to address a central challenge in the field rather than just a theoretical framework."
