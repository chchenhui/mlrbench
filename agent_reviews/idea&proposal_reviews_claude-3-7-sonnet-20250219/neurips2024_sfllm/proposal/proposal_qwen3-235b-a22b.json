        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for statistical tools for black-box models as specified in the task, focusing specifically on conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The proposal elaborates on the semantic conformal prediction framework outlined in the research idea, maintaining fidelity to the core concept of using embedding spaces and nonconformity scores based on cosine distance. The literature review is well-integrated, with references to recent works like ConU (Wang et al., 2024) and conformal factuality (Mohri & Hashimoto, 2024) properly acknowledged and positioned relative to the proposed approach. The only minor inconsistency is that some papers mentioned in the literature review aren't explicitly cited in the proposal, but this doesn't significantly impact the overall coherence."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated with formal notation, and the methodology is presented in a step-by-step manner that is easy to follow. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly in the semantic nonconformity scoring and calibration algorithm sections. The experimental design clearly outlines datasets, metrics, and evaluation procedures. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for ensuring coverage guarantees in the recursive conformal prediction for chain-of-thought reasoning could be more detailed, (2) the adaptive scaling formula introduces parameters without fully explaining how λ would be optimized, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'exchangeability') are used without definition, which might be unclear to readers unfamiliar with conformal prediction theory."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by combining conformal prediction with semantic embedding spaces specifically for LLM uncertainty quantification. While conformal prediction itself is not new, and several papers in the literature review (e.g., ConU, Conformal Language Modeling) have applied it to LLMs, this proposal introduces several novel elements: (1) the specific formulation of nonconformity scores using cosine similarity in embedding space, (2) the extension to chain-of-thought reasoning through recursive conformal prediction, and (3) the adaptive scaling mechanism to balance coverage and informativeness. The approach differs from prior work like ConU by focusing on semantic similarity rather than self-consistency, and from conformal factuality by emphasizing black-box access without requiring model internals. However, the core technique builds upon established conformal prediction methods, and some components (like using sentence embeddings for similarity) are relatively standard in NLP, limiting the groundbreaking nature of the innovation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The conformal prediction framework is mathematically well-formulated with proper notation and clear algorithms for both calibration and prediction. The theoretical guarantees of coverage (P(r ∈ Γτ(p)) ≥ 1-α) are correctly stated and align with established conformal prediction theory. The choice of cosine similarity as a nonconformity measure is well-justified based on empirical findings about hallucinations exhibiting low similarity to truth. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics that directly measure the claimed benefits. The proposal also acknowledges the exchangeability assumption underlying conformal prediction. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the approach: (1) more detailed analysis of how the method handles distribution shifts between calibration and test data, (2) formal proof of coverage guarantees for the recursive chain-of-thought extension, and (3) clearer justification for the specific form of the adaptive scaling penalty term."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods. The core components—sentence embeddings, conformal prediction, and LLM sampling—are all established techniques with available implementations. The data requirements (calibration datasets like MedQuAD) are reasonable and accessible. The black-box nature of the method makes it applicable to any LLM via API, enhancing practicality. However, several implementation challenges exist: (1) generating and processing top-k samples (up to k=100 in experiments) from LLMs could be computationally expensive and API-cost intensive, (2) ensuring the calibration dataset is truly representative of the target distribution is challenging in practice, especially for specialized domains, (3) the recursive conformal prediction for chain-of-thought reasoning might face scalability issues as the number of reasoning steps increases, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address how to handle very long outputs where embedding-based similarity might be less effective. These challenges don't render the approach infeasible but would require careful engineering and optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety and deployment: providing reliable uncertainty quantification for black-box LLMs. This has substantial significance for high-stakes applications like healthcare and legal advice, where hallucinations and overconfidence can lead to harmful outcomes. The approach offers several important contributions: (1) distribution-free coverage guarantees that enhance trustworthiness, (2) a framework applicable to any black-box LLM without requiring model modifications, (3) potential for reducing hallucinations through semantic filtering, and (4) extensions to complex reasoning tasks. The expected impact on regulatory compliance and ML safety community is well-articulated and realistic. The open-source framework could enable broader adoption of conformal prediction in LLM applications. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on a specific uncertainty quantification technique rather than a transformative new paradigm, and the practical impact will depend on how well the method scales to real-world deployment scenarios with shifting distributions and diverse user queries."
