    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for statistical tools in the black-box model era, focusing specifically on conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in LLMs - a key topic mentioned in the task description. The proposal faithfully expands on the core idea of semantic conformal prediction sets, maintaining the focus on providing distribution-free guarantees for black-box LLMs. It thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works (e.g., references to ConU [1], multiple-choice QA [2], and conformal language modeling [3]) and addressing all five key challenges identified. The methodology section clearly builds upon the semantic embedding approach outlined in the idea, with detailed explanations of how to implement the calibration and prediction phases. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal goes into significantly more detail than the original idea, but this is an enhancement rather than a misalignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated, with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The algorithmic steps are presented in a systematic manner, with both calibration and prediction phases clearly delineated. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-explained, with appropriate notation and definitions. The experimental design is comprehensive, detailing the models, datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics to be used. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The relationship between the proxy score and true nonconformity score could be more explicitly formalized; (2) The theoretical justification section acknowledges the heuristic nature of the approach but could more rigorously address the conditions under which the guarantees hold; and (3) Some technical details about the implementation of the embedding models and their computational requirements could be more specific. Despite these minor issues, the overall clarity of the proposal is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by combining conformal prediction with semantic embeddings specifically for black-box LLMs. While conformal prediction itself is not new, and several papers in the literature review (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]) have applied it to language models, this proposal makes several novel contributions: (1) The focus on semantic embeddings to define nonconformity scores for open-ended generation tasks; (2) The development of proxy scores based on self-consistency that work without access to reference outputs at test time; (3) The specific application to black-box LLMs via APIs, making it widely applicable; and (4) The comprehensive framework that addresses both calibration and prediction phases. However, the proposal shares similarities with existing approaches, particularly ConU [1] which also uses self-consistency theory, and the semantic embedding approach mentioned in [7]. The novelty is therefore incremental rather than groundbreaking, building upon and extending existing concepts rather than introducing entirely new paradigms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a solid theoretical basis in conformal prediction. The mathematical formulation is correct, and the methodology follows established principles of statistical learning. The connection to existing literature is strong, with appropriate citations and comparisons. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) The theoretical justification acknowledges that the link between the proxy score and true nonconformity score is heuristic rather than rigorous, which could undermine the formal guarantees of conformal prediction; (2) The exchangeability assumption required for conformal prediction guarantees is mentioned but not thoroughly examined in the context of LLM outputs; (3) The proposal relies heavily on the quality of semantic embeddings, but doesn't fully address potential limitations or biases in these embeddings; and (4) While the experimental design is comprehensive, some of the evaluation metrics (like 'semantic correctness') are subjective and could be challenging to quantify reliably. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is methodologically sound and the limitations are acknowledged with proposed mitigation strategies."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly feasible approach that can be implemented with existing technologies and resources. The methodology relies on widely available components: (1) Black-box LLM APIs from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google; (2) Established sentence embedding models; and (3) Standard datasets for evaluation. The computational requirements, while significant, are not prohibitive, especially since the framework is inherently parallelizable. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and provides reasonable mitigation strategies, such as investigating the trade-off between the number of candidates, performance, and cost. The experimental design is realistic and well-scoped, with clear evaluation metrics and baselines. The calibration phase requires a dataset of prompt-reference pairs, which is feasible to obtain from existing benchmarks. The main implementation challenge is the development of effective proxy scores that correlate well with true nonconformity, but the proposal offers multiple approaches to address this. Overall, the research could be executed with current technology and reasonable resources, making it highly feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety and trustworthiness - providing reliable uncertainty quantification for black-box LLMs. This has significant implications for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal advice, directly aligning with the task's focus on auditing, safety, and risk analysis. The potential impact is substantial: (1) It offers a practical tool for practitioners to enhance the reliability of LLM applications without requiring access to model internals; (2) It provides a principled approach to reducing hallucinations, a major concern in current LLM deployments; (3) It contributes to the statistical foundations of modern AI systems, extending conformal prediction to complex semantic outputs; and (4) It establishes a framework that can be built upon for future research. The significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the innovation and the heuristic aspects of the approach, which may not fully solve the hallucination problem. However, even incremental progress in this critical area would be valuable, and the proposal has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to safer AI deployment."
