    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for statistical tools for black-box models as specified in the task, focusing specifically on conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The methodology elaborates on the semantic conformal prediction framework outlined in the research idea, maintaining consistency in approach and objectives. The proposal also builds upon the literature review, citing relevant concepts from conformal prediction research and addressing key challenges identified in the review. The only minor inconsistency is that some references mentioned in the literature review (particularly papers 5-10) aren't explicitly cited in the proposal, though their concepts are incorporated."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in a step-by-step manner with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact procedure for handling multiple reference embeddings during test-time prediction set construction could be more precisely defined, (2) the details of how the CoT reasoning steps would be evaluated against a 'verifier model' need elaboration, and (3) the relationship between the minimum distance calculation at test time versus the direct cosine distance used during calibration could be better explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel approach by combining semantic embeddings with conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in black-box LLMs. The use of embedding spaces to compute nonconformity scores represents an innovative extension of traditional conformal prediction methods. The extension to chain-of-thought reasoning for auditing intermediate steps is particularly original. However, the core methodology builds upon existing conformal prediction frameworks (as cited in the literature review) rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm. The proposal incrementally advances the field by adapting and extending known techniques to the semantic domain of LLMs, rather than presenting a revolutionary approach. The comparison with existing methods like ConU (Wang et al., 2024) acknowledges this evolutionary rather than revolutionary nature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The conformal prediction framework is mathematically well-formulated with proper quantile calculations to ensure the desired coverage guarantees. The use of cosine distance in embedding space as a nonconformity score is theoretically justified. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) the assumption that semantic similarity in embedding space correlates with output correctness needs more validation, (2) the minimum distance calculation at test time might introduce statistical dependencies that could affect coverage guarantees, and (3) the aggregation method for chain-of-thought reasoning scores is not fully specified. Despite these minor concerns, the overall approach is technically sound and grounded in established statistical principles."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach that can be implemented with existing technologies and resources. The method relies on widely available tools like pre-trained sentence encoders and black-box LLM APIs. The computational requirements appear reasonable, with the authors claiming linear time complexity relative to calibration set size. However, several practical challenges may affect implementation: (1) collecting high-quality calibration data with reliable reference outputs for domain-specific tasks could be resource-intensive, (2) generating multiple candidates for each prompt increases computational costs, especially for large models, (3) the effectiveness of the approach depends on the quality of the embedding model, which may vary across domains, and (4) the extension to chain-of-thought reasoning adds complexity that might be challenging to implement effectively. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present notable implementation hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need for reliable uncertainty quantification in black-box LLMs, which is essential for their safe deployment in high-stakes domains. The potential impact is substantial, particularly in safety-critical applications like healthcare and legal advice where hallucinations and overconfidence can have serious consequences. The method's ability to provide statistical guarantees on output correctness without requiring access to model internals makes it widely applicable to commercial LLM APIs. The extension to chain-of-thought reasoning further enhances its significance by enabling safety audits of complex reasoning processes. The theoretical contribution of bridging conformal prediction with semantic embedding spaces could inspire new statistical tools for generative AI. While the approach may not completely solve the hallucination problem, it represents a significant step toward safer LLM deployment with quantifiable uncertainty."
