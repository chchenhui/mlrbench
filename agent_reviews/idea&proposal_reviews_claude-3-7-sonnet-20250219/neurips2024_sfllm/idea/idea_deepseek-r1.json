        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is extremely well-aligned with the task description. It directly addresses the need for 'new statistical tools for the era of black-box models where standard statistical ideas don't apply' by proposing an adaptive conformal prediction framework specifically designed for black-box LLMs. The idea explicitly focuses on uncertainty quantification techniques for LLMs, which is one of the listed topics in the task description. The proposal aims to bridge the gap between black-box AI and operational safety standards, which aligns perfectly with the task's emphasis on statistical foundations for understanding and mitigating operational risks. The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that while it strongly addresses uncertainty quantification and safety analysis, it doesn't explicitly connect to some of the other listed topics like watermarking or privacy."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (uncertainty quantification for black-box LLMs), the proposed solution (adaptive conformal prediction framework), the methodology (using proxy nonconformity scores and online updates), and expected outcomes (theoretical guarantees and open-source tools). The technical approach is well-defined with specific examples of proxy nonconformity scores. However, there are some minor ambiguities that prevent a perfect score: the exact mechanism for 'lightweight online updates' could be more precisely defined, and the details of how the 'temperature scaling-like techniques' would be implemented for calibration are somewhat vague. Additionally, while the proposal mentions 'relaxed exchangeability assumptions,' it doesn't specify what these relaxations entail."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong novelty by addressing a significant gap in current approaches to uncertainty quantification for black-box LLMs. Traditional conformal prediction methods typically require access to model internals or assume exchangeable data, but this proposal innovatively adapts these methods for black-box scenarios. The concept of using 'proxy nonconformity scores' derived from observable outputs is particularly innovative, as is the integration of online updates to handle distribution shifts. While conformal prediction itself is an established methodology, its application to black-box LLMs with these specific adaptations represents a fresh approach. The score is not higher because some elements build upon existing conformal prediction literature and temperature scaling techniques, though their combination and adaptation for black-box LLMs is indeed novel."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The proposal leverages observable outputs from LLMs (token probabilities, attention entropy, embedding dispersion) which are typically available even in API-based interactions. The online update mechanism based on feedback is implementable, and the experimental validation on established benchmarks is realistic. However, there are some implementation challenges that prevent a higher score: (1) obtaining reliable proxy nonconformity scores from black-box APIs may be difficult if the API doesn't expose sufficient information; (2) establishing theoretical guarantees under relaxed exchangeability assumptions could be mathematically challenging; and (3) the effectiveness of the approach may vary significantly across different LLM architectures and APIs, potentially requiring substantial adaptation work."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in AI safety and deployment. As LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes applications like healthcare and legal analysis, reliable uncertainty quantification becomes essential for responsible deployment. The proposed framework could significantly impact how black-box LLMs are used in practice by providing statistically rigorous uncertainty estimates without requiring access to model internals. This bridges an important gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and operational safety requirements. The potential to enable safer deployment of LLMs in domains requiring statistical rigor has broad implications for the field and society. The open-source tools mentioned would also democratize access to these safety measures. The significance is particularly high given the rapid proliferation of black-box LLM APIs in critical applications."
