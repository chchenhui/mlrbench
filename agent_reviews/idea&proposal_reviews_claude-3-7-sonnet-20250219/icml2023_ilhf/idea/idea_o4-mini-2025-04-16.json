        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing the core challenge of learning from implicit multimodal feedback signals during human-machine interaction. It directly tackles several key topics mentioned in the task: learning from natural/implicit signals (gaze, facial expressions, gestures, speech), handling non-stationary human preferences through a Bayesian model that adapts over time, and resolving ambiguity in feedback signals. The proposal also addresses the balance between pre-training and personalization, with a focus on adapting to individual signaling styles. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly discuss the theoretical minimal assumptions for interaction-grounded learning, though it does propose a practical framework."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a three-part framework with clear components: (1) multimodal data collection, (2) self-supervised cross-modal contrastive learning for embedding signals, and (3) Bayesian reward modeling. The flow of information and processing is logical and well-articulated. The approach to handling ambiguity through sparse active queries is well-defined. The only minor ambiguities relate to the specific implementation details of the cross-modal contrastive learning and how exactly the latent clusters are mapped to scalar feedback values. While these technical details would need elaboration in a full proposal, the core concept and approach are presented with sufficient clarity for evaluation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of self-supervised cross-modal contrastive learning to create a unified representation of diverse implicit feedback signals is innovative. Most existing approaches either focus on a single modality or use hand-crafted mappings for multimodal signals. The Bayesian approach to mapping latent clusters to rewards, combined with active learning for disambiguation, represents a fresh perspective on the problem. The focus on non-stationary reward learning is also forward-thinking. While individual components (contrastive learning, Bayesian modeling, active learning) exist in the literature, their combination and application to implicit multimodal feedback in interactive RL constitutes a novel approach that advances beyond current methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The technical components (contrastive learning, Bayesian modeling, RL) are well-established, and the necessary sensing technologies for capturing multimodal signals exist. However, several practical challenges need addressing: (1) collecting synchronized multimodal data during real-time interactions requires careful engineering, (2) learning meaningful latent representations that capture reward-relevant information across modalities is non-trivial, (3) the Bayesian reward model needs to balance adaptability with stability, and (4) the active query mechanism must be designed to minimize user interruption while maximizing information gain. These challenges are surmountable with current technology and methods, but would require significant engineering effort and careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in interactive learning systems: the ability to learn from natural human feedback without requiring explicit reward signals. The potential impact is substantial across multiple domains. In robotics, it could enable more intuitive human-robot interaction without specialized interfaces. For tutoring systems, it could allow adaptation to student engagement signals without explicit ratings. For assistive technologies, it could make systems more responsive to users with communication difficulties. By reducing the need for hand-crafted reward channels and enabling personalization to individual signaling styles, the approach could significantly advance the deployment of interactive learning systems in real-world settings. The work also bridges multiple disciplines (RL, HCI, multimodal learning), potentially catalyzing further cross-disciplinary research."
