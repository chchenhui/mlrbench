    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenge of learning from implicit, multimodal human feedback (facial expressions, gaze, gestures) during interaction, which is a central theme of the task. The proposal specifically tackles non-stationary human preferences through meta-learning, addresses the challenge of learning without predefined semantics through inverse reinforcement learning, and focuses on intrinsic reward learning - all key topics mentioned in the task description. The only minor limitation is that while it mentions applications in healthcare and education, it doesn't explicitly address the accessibility and ability-based design aspects mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the motivation, main idea, methodology, and expected outcomes. The framework for learning intrinsic reward functions from multimodal implicit feedback is well-defined, with a concrete example (robot tutor responding to confused expressions) that illustrates the concept effectively. The three-step methodology provides a clear roadmap for implementation. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific architecture of the transformer-based model, how the contrastive model would work in practice, and how the meta-reinforcement learning loop would be structured. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of multimodal implicit feedback for intrinsic reward learning represents a fresh approach compared to traditional hand-crafted reward systems. The combination of transformer-based encoding of multimodal signals, inverse reinforcement learning for reward inference without predefined semantics, and meta-learning for adaptation to non-stationary preferences creates a novel framework. While individual components (transformers, IRL, meta-learning) exist in the literature, their integration for socially-aligned intrinsic reward learning from multimodal feedback appears innovative. The approach isn't entirely unprecedented, as some research exists on multimodal feedback interpretation, but the comprehensive framework and application to intrinsic reward learning shows considerable originality."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. While collecting multimodal interaction data is achievable, creating a comprehensive dataset with diverse, naturalistic feedback across multiple modalities would require significant resources. Training a contrastive model to accurately map various feedback modalities to latent reward proxies is technically complex, especially when dealing with subtle social cues that may vary across individuals and cultures. The meta-reinforcement learning component adds another layer of complexity. Current technology can support implementation of individual components, but integrating them into a cohesive system that works reliably in real-world settings with noisy, ambiguous human feedback presents substantial challenges. The proposal would benefit from more details on how to address these implementation hurdles, particularly regarding data collection protocols and evaluation metrics."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current interactive learning systems - their inability to leverage the rich, implicit feedback that humans naturally provide. Successfully developing agents that can interpret multimodal social cues would represent a major advancement in human-AI interaction, with far-reaching implications for assistive robotics, personalized education, healthcare, and other domains requiring social awareness. The potential to reduce reliance on explicit rewards could make AI systems more accessible to non-technical users and enable more natural human-AI collaboration. The approach could also contribute fundamental insights to our understanding of how machines can learn from social interaction. The significance is particularly high given the growing deployment of AI assistants in socially complex real-world settings where understanding implicit feedback is crucial."
