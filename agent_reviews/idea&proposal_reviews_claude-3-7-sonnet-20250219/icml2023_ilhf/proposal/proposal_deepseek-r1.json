    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of learning from implicit multimodal human feedback during interaction, which is central to the task description. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the framework for learning intrinsic reward functions from multimodal signals, the transformer-based encoding approach, and the meta-learning component for adaptation. The methodology thoroughly integrates concepts from the literature review, citing relevant works like PEBBLE (Lee et al., 2021) and referencing the challenges identified in papers by Abramson et al. (2022) and others. The proposal also addresses most of the topics mentioned in the task description, including non-stationarity of human preferences, learning from natural feedback signals, and designing intrinsic reward systems for social alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from background to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and broken down into manageable components. The technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations that enhance understanding rather than obscuring it. The experimental design section provides concrete details about baselines, metrics, and implementation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the contrastive learning model with the IRL framework could be more explicitly detailed, (2) the relationship between the latent space representation and the reward function inference could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'Meta-Neural Process') are introduced without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to multimodal implicit feedback interpretation. The integration of contrastive learning for multimodal alignment with inverse reinforcement learning and meta-RL represents a novel combination not fully explored in the cited literature. The framework for mapping heterogeneous feedback signals into a unified latent space representing human intent is particularly innovative. However, while the individual components (contrastive learning, IRL, meta-RL) are well-established techniques, the proposal primarily combines existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The application to socially complex domains like education and healthcare is valuable but not unprecedented. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work like PEBBLE and MIA by focusing on implicit multimodal feedback rather than explicit preferences or imitation, but builds incrementally on these foundations rather than presenting a revolutionary approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for contrastive learning and maximum entropy IRL are correctly presented and appropriate for the task. The three-stage framework (multimodal encoding, intrinsic reward learning, meta-adaptive policy optimization) is logically structured and builds on established theoretical principles. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, such as the need for data annotation and the complexity of multimodal fusion. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the approach: (1) the identifiability conditions for latent rewards are mentioned as a theoretical contribution but not elaborated upon, (2) the statistical validity of the proposed evaluation metrics could be more thoroughly justified, and (3) the proposal could benefit from a more detailed error analysis or ablation study design to isolate the contribution of each component."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation details. The data collection approach using simulated environments with synchronized multimodal streams is practical and achievable. The technical components (transformer encoders, contrastive learning, IRL, meta-RL) are all established methods with available implementations. The evaluation metrics are measurable and the experimental design is comprehensive. However, there are several implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) collecting and annotating 500+ multimodal interactions could be resource-intensive and time-consuming, (2) the integration of multiple sensing technologies (Tobii eyetracker, OpenFace, Kinect) introduces technical complexity and potential synchronization issues, (3) the computational requirements for training transformer models and meta-learning algorithms simultaneously could be substantial, and (4) the proposal does not fully address potential challenges in real-time processing of multimodal data streams. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that would require careful planning and resource allocation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in interactive learning systems by enabling agents to learn from naturalistic human feedback without relying on hand-crafted rewards. This has significant implications for deploying AI systems in real-world social contexts like healthcare, education, and assistive robotics. The potential impact is well-articulated across three dimensions: personalization, scalability, and social coordination. The expected outcomes, including a unified multimodal encoding model and meta-adaptive policies, would represent meaningful advances in the field. The broader impact section thoughtfully considers ethical implications and accessibility benefits, particularly for users with limited capacity to provide structured input. The theoretical contribution regarding identifiability conditions for latent rewards could also advance the fundamental understanding of interaction-grounded learning. While the proposal may not revolutionize the entire field of interactive AI, it addresses a significant problem with potentially far-reaching applications and builds important bridges between machine learning and human-computer interaction."
