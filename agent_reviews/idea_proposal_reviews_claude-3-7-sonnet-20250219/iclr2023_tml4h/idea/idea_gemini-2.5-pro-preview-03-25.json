        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on trustworthy machine learning for healthcare. It directly addresses uncertainty estimation, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The proposal also incorporates multi-modal fusion (CT scans and EHR data), another key area highlighted in the task description. The emphasis on enhancing clinical decision support safety and trustworthiness for clinicians perfectly matches the workshop's goal of improving ML credibility to increase trust among healthcare professionals. The only minor reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that it could more explicitly address how it might integrate with human-machine cooperation, which is mentioned in the task description."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured with clear motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The technical approach combining evidential learning with conformal prediction is specified, and the practical application (generating prediction sets with coverage guarantees) is well-defined. The proposal clearly explains how it addresses uncertainty quantification in multi-modal settings. However, it could benefit from slightly more detail on the specific implementation of evidential learning for multi-modal fusion and how the conformal prediction layer will be adapted to handle the evidential outputs from different modalities. Some technical specifics about the calibration process could also enhance clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining two established methodologies (evidential learning and conformal prediction) in a novel way for multi-modal medical diagnosis. While both methods individually are not new, their integration specifically for multi-modal healthcare applications with formal statistical guarantees represents a fresh approach. The focus on distinguishing between different uncertainty sources in a multi-modal context adds innovative elements. However, both conformal prediction and evidential learning have been applied separately in healthcare contexts before, and the combination, while valuable, is an extension of existing approaches rather than a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible as it builds upon established methodologies with proven implementations. Conformal prediction has well-developed theoretical foundations and practical implementations, and evidential learning frameworks exist in various deep learning libraries. Multi-modal fusion techniques are also well-studied. The required medical data types (CT scans, EHR) are commonly available in research settings with appropriate permissions. The main implementation challenges would likely involve adapting conformal prediction to work effectively with the evidential outputs and ensuring proper calibration across modalities with different statistical properties. These challenges appear surmountable with current technology and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical gap in healthcare ML applications: the need for reliable uncertainty quantification with formal guarantees. The significance is high because trustworthy uncertainty estimates are essential for clinical adoption of ML systems, directly impacting patient safety. The multi-modal aspect increases significance further, as real clinical decisions often integrate multiple data types. The approach could substantially improve how ML models flag cases needing expert review, potentially preventing harmful automated decisions in ambiguous cases. The formal statistical guarantees would provide a level of assurance currently missing in many healthcare ML applications, potentially accelerating responsible clinical integration of these technologies."
