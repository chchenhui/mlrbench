    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on trustworthy ML for healthcare, particularly targeting multi-modal fusion, uncertainty estimation, explainability, and generalization to out-of-distribution samples. The proposed DRAM-Net framework faithfully implements the core idea of dynamic modality reliability estimation using Bayesian neural networks and attention mechanisms. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing all four papers and addressing the key challenges they identified (modality heterogeneity, missing data, noise, interpretability, and uncertainty estimation). The methodology section provides a comprehensive implementation plan that is consistent with both the research idea and the literature context."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The technical approach is explained in detail, with clear mathematical formulations for the reliability-guided attention mechanism and training procedure. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined evaluation scenarios and metrics. The only minor limitations in clarity are: (1) some technical details about the BNN implementation could be more specific (e.g., exact architecture choices for different modalities), and (2) the proposal could benefit from a visual diagram of the DRAM-Net architecture to enhance understanding of the component interactions. Overall, the proposal is highly understandable and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in several aspects. The core innovation lies in the dynamic assessment of modality reliability at inference time using Bayesian uncertainty estimation, which goes beyond the static weighting or standard attention mechanisms in existing works. The integration of a self-supervised auxiliary task to explicitly teach the model to recognize modality corruption is another novel element. While the individual components (BNNs, attention mechanisms, self-supervision) are established techniques, their combination and application to the specific problem of modality reliability in medical fusion represents a fresh approach. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work (MDA, DRIFA-Net, HEALNet, DrFuse) by highlighting its focus on explicit reliability modeling rather than just handling missing data or using standard attention. However, it builds incrementally on existing methods rather than proposing a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness and rigor. The methodology is built on well-established theoretical foundations in Bayesian deep learning, multi-modal fusion, and attention mechanisms. The mathematical formulation of the reliability-guided attention is technically correct and well-justified. The training procedure, including the multi-component loss function, is clearly defined and follows sound machine learning principles. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, evaluation scenarios, and metrics that directly address the research questions. The proposal also acknowledges practical implementation considerations, such as the choice between MC Dropout and Variational Inference for uncertainty estimation. The only minor limitation is that some hyperparameters (e.g., λ in the attention mechanism, β and γ in the loss function) are introduced without detailed discussion of how they would be optimized or their potential impact on model behavior."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation paths. The use of publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR, TCGA, BraTS) ensures data accessibility. The technical approach leverages established methods (BNNs via MC Dropout or VI, attention mechanisms) that have existing implementations in deep learning frameworks. The experimental design is comprehensive but manageable. However, there are some feasibility challenges: (1) Training BNNs, especially with VI, can be computationally intensive and may require significant GPU resources; (2) The proposal involves multiple components (modality-specific encoders, BNN uncertainty estimation, self-supervised learning, attention mechanism) that need to be integrated and optimized together, which could introduce implementation complexities; (3) The evaluation on multiple datasets across different medical tasks is ambitious and may require domain-specific adaptations. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is feasible with appropriate resources and expertise in deep learning and medical data analysis."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in healthcare AI: the trustworthiness of multi-modal fusion models in real-world clinical settings where data quality varies. This has significant implications for clinical adoption of AI systems. The expected contributions are substantial: (1) A novel framework that explicitly models modality reliability, enhancing robustness to data quality issues; (2) Improved uncertainty quantification that could prevent overconfident errors in clinical decision support; (3) Enhanced interpretability through attention weights that indicate which modalities influenced the prediction. These contributions directly address the 'trust gap' identified in the introduction, potentially accelerating the translation of multi-modal ML into clinical practice. The methodology could also generalize beyond healthcare to other domains requiring reliable multi-modal fusion. The alignment with the workshop's focus on trustworthy ML for healthcare further underscores its significance. The proposal could have even higher significance if it included plans for clinical validation or collaboration with healthcare practitioners."
