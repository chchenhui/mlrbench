        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on trustworthy ML for healthcare, specifically targeting multi-modal fusion, uncertainty estimation, and explainability. The proposed DMREAF framework comprehensively implements the core idea of dynamic modality reliability estimation using Bayesian neural networks and attention mechanisms. The proposal builds upon the literature review by addressing limitations in existing approaches (MDA, DRIFA-Net, HEALNet, DrFuse) regarding dynamic reliability assessment. The methodology section thoroughly details how the framework handles missing modalities, quantifies uncertainty, and provides interpretability - all key aspects mentioned in both the task description and research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem formulation to methodology and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for the Bayesian reliability estimators, attention mechanisms, and training objectives. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact implementation details of the corruption function c(X^m, δ) could be more specific for each modality type; (2) The relationship between the reliability estimates and the global uncertainty measure could be more explicitly connected to decision-making; and (3) Some technical terms (e.g., ECE, IoU) are used without full explanation, which might be challenging for interdisciplinary readers."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to multi-modal fusion in healthcare by introducing dynamic reliability estimation during inference time. The key innovations include: (1) Bayesian reliability estimators that quantify per-modality uncertainty, (2) reliability-guided attention fusion that dynamically weights modalities, and (3) self-supervised reliability learning through synthetic corruption detection. While these components individually build upon existing techniques (Bayesian neural networks, attention mechanisms, self-supervised learning), their integration into a cohesive framework for modality reliability estimation represents a fresh perspective. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that uncertainty estimation in multi-modal fusion has been explored in prior work (e.g., DRIFA-Net uses Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation), and attention-based fusion is common in the literature. The self-supervised corruption detection task is perhaps the most novel aspect, though similar approaches exist in other domains."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The Bayesian approach to uncertainty quantification is theoretically well-grounded, and the use of Monte Carlo dropout provides a computationally tractable approximation. The attention mechanism for reliability-weighted fusion is mathematically sound, with clear formulations for computing attention weights based on reliability estimates. The self-supervised learning approach offers a practical solution to the lack of explicit reliability labels. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contribution of each component. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) The assumption that synthetic corruptions will generalize to real-world reliability issues needs stronger justification; (2) The calibration of the reliability estimates to actual modality quality could benefit from more rigorous validation approaches; and (3) The interaction between the temperature parameter β and the reliability estimates could be more thoroughly analyzed for potential instabilities."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation requirements. The core components (Bayesian neural networks, attention mechanisms, self-supervised learning) are established techniques with available implementations. The datasets mentioned (BraTS, MIMIC-CXR + MIMIC-IV, ADNI) are publicly accessible and commonly used in medical ML research. The experimental design is comprehensive but manageable. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) The computational cost of performing multiple forward passes for Monte Carlo dropout during inference may be prohibitive for real-time clinical applications; (2) Creating realistic synthetic corruptions that mimic actual clinical data quality issues requires domain expertise and careful validation; (3) The evaluation by clinical experts mentioned in the interpretability metrics may be difficult to arrange and standardize; and (4) The proposed framework involves multiple components and hyperparameters (λ, β, T, corruption types) that will require extensive tuning, potentially making the approach less practical for immediate clinical deployment."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in deploying multi-modal ML systems in healthcare: the varying reliability of different data modalities in real-world settings. The significance is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) Clinical impact: By providing reliability-weighted predictions with appropriate uncertainty estimates, the approach could enhance diagnostic confidence and reduce errors in clinical decision-making; (2) Technical contribution: The framework offers a principled approach to dynamic reliability estimation that could be applied beyond healthcare; (3) Practical utility: The ability to handle missing or corrupted modalities addresses a common challenge in clinical settings where complete data is often unavailable; (4) Trustworthiness: The approach simultaneously addresses multiple dimensions of ML trustworthiness (robustness, uncertainty quantification, interpretability) that are essential for clinical adoption. The expected outcomes are well-aligned with the needs of the medical community, and the proposed benchmark for reliability-aware fusion could influence future research directions. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on technical improvements rather than direct clinical validation, which would require prospective trials to demonstrate actual impact on patient outcomes."
