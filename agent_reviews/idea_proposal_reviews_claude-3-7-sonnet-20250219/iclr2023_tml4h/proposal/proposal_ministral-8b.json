    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on trustworthy ML for healthcare, specifically targeting multi-modal fusion and uncertainty estimation. The proposal incorporates the core concept from the research idea of dynamically estimating modality-specific reliability during inference using Bayesian neural networks and attention mechanisms. It also builds upon the challenges identified in the literature review, including modality heterogeneity, missing data, intrinsic noise, and interpretability. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed framework will address these challenges through Bayesian uncertainty quantification and attention-based fusion. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review emphasizes interpretability as a key challenge, the proposal could have elaborated more on how the attention maps specifically enhance interpretability beyond just highlighting trusted modalities."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and align with the methodology. The algorithmic steps are presented with mathematical formulations that enhance understanding of the approach. The experimental design and validation sections provide clear metrics for evaluation. The expected outcomes and impact are logically connected to the proposed methods. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the self-supervised auxiliary task and the main fusion task could be more explicitly defined, particularly how they interact during training; (2) While the proposal mentions simulated and real-world modality degradation scenarios, it could provide more specific details about how these scenarios will be created and controlled; (3) The proposal could more clearly articulate how the attention mechanism's weights are influenced by the uncertainty estimates from the Bayesian neural networks."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing techniques in a novel way to address the specific challenge of modality reliability in medical fusion. The integration of Bayesian neural networks for uncertainty quantification with attention mechanisms for modality weighting is innovative, especially in the medical domain. The self-supervised auxiliary task for predicting modality corruption is a creative approach to teaching the model to assess reliability. However, the core components (Bayesian neural networks, attention mechanisms, self-supervised learning) are established techniques, and similar approaches have been explored in the literature review papers (e.g., DRIFA-Net uses attention mechanisms and Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation). The proposal extends these ideas rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The benchmarking contribution for reliability-aware fusion adds to the novelty, but more details on how these benchmarks would differ from existing ones would strengthen this aspect."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for Bayesian neural networks, uncertainty quantification, and attention mechanisms are correctly presented and appropriate for the task. The evaluation metrics (accuracy, uncertainty calibration using ECE, interpretability assessment) are well-chosen and comprehensive. The research design logically connects the components of the framework. The use of publicly available datasets (MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, TCGA) provides a solid foundation for validation. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges of modality heterogeneity and missing data, and provides specific approaches to address them. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal could provide more details on the specific architecture of the Bayesian neural networks and how variational inference will be implemented; (2) The self-supervised auxiliary task could benefit from more rigorous formulation of how it will be integrated with the main task; (3) The proposal could elaborate on potential failure modes and how they would be addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The use of publicly available datasets (MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, TCGA) ensures data accessibility. The algorithmic components (Bayesian neural networks, attention mechanisms) are established techniques with available implementations. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and measurable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional resources or refinement: (1) Training Bayesian neural networks can be computationally expensive, especially for multiple modalities; (2) Creating realistic simulated modality degradation scenarios that accurately reflect real-world conditions may require domain expertise and careful design; (3) The proposal mentions comparing attention maps with domain expert annotations, which would require significant clinical collaboration; (4) Handling the heterogeneity of multi-modal medical data (different resolutions, formats, etc.) will require substantial preprocessing efforts. While these challenges are manageable, they represent non-trivial implementation hurdles that should be acknowledged."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in healthcare ML: the trustworthiness of multi-modal fusion models in the presence of unreliable modalities. This has clear clinical relevance, as medical decisions based on overconfident or unreliable predictions could lead to harmful outcomes. The expected contributions—improved robustness to unreliable modalities, uncertainty-aware predictions, interpretable attention maps, and benchmarks for reliability-aware fusion—would significantly advance the field of trustworthy ML for healthcare. The framework could enable safer deployment of multi-modal ML in clinical settings by reducing overconfidence and enhancing transparency. The benchmarking contribution could have lasting impact by providing standards for evaluating future methods. The proposal also aligns well with the growing emphasis on uncertainty quantification and interpretability in healthcare ML. While the impact is substantial, it is somewhat limited by focusing primarily on the technical aspects of trustworthiness rather than addressing broader challenges like regulatory approval, clinical workflow integration, or patient acceptance, which would be necessary for real-world clinical adoption."
