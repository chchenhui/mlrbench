        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on trustworthy machine learning for healthcare, particularly in multi-modal fusion and uncertainty estimation. The proposed framework for dynamic modality reliability estimation perfectly matches the original idea of using Bayesian neural networks and attention mechanisms to assess modality-specific reliability during inference. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with the proposal building upon and addressing limitations in existing works like MDA, DRIFA-Net, HEALNet, and DrFuse. The proposal comprehensively covers all aspects mentioned in the task scope, including uncertainty estimation, explainability, and multi-modal fusion of medical data types (CT, MRI, EHRs). The only minor inconsistency is that while the original idea mentioned a self-supervised auxiliary task for predicting modality corruption, the proposal could have elaborated more on the specific implementation details of this component."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formulations. The Bayesian fusion architecture, uncertainty-aware attention mechanism, and training strategy are all well-defined. The proposal effectively communicates how uncertainty estimation will be integrated into the attention mechanism and how this will enhance model robustness and interpretability. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the self-supervised auxiliary task for modality corruption detection is mentioned but not fully elaborated with specific implementation details, (2) the exact evaluation metrics and experimental design could be more precisely defined, and (3) some of the mathematical notations could be more consistently applied throughout the document. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a novel integration of Bayesian uncertainty estimation with attention-based fusion for dynamic modality reliability assessment. While individual components like Bayesian neural networks and attention mechanisms exist in the literature, their combination for modality-specific reliability estimation in medical fusion represents a fresh approach. The proposal clearly differentiates itself from prior work (MDA, DRIFA-Net, HEALNet, DrFuse) by highlighting that existing methods often assume static reliability across modalities, whereas the proposed approach dynamically adjusts based on input conditions. The self-supervised auxiliary task for modality corruption detection adds another layer of innovation. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing techniques rather than introducing entirely new methodological paradigms, and some aspects (like uncertainty-weighted attention) have parallels in other domains. The novelty lies more in the specific application and integration of these techniques for medical multi-modal fusion rather than in fundamentally new algorithms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The Bayesian neural network approach for uncertainty estimation is mathematically rigorous, with appropriate formulations for variational approximation and Monte Carlo integration. The uncertainty-aware attention mechanism is logically designed to incorporate reliability estimates into the fusion process. The methodology builds upon established techniques in Bayesian deep learning and attention mechanisms, ensuring a solid foundation. The evaluation strategy includes appropriate datasets (CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, TCGA) and metrics (accuracy, AUROC, AUPRC, calibration errors) that align with the research objectives. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to isolate the impact of different components. One minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions a self-supervised auxiliary task, it doesn't fully elaborate on the technical details of how this would be implemented. Additionally, the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential limitations or failure modes of the Bayesian approach, such as computational complexity or challenges in posterior approximation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technologies and resources. The methodology relies on established techniques in Bayesian neural networks and attention mechanisms, which have existing implementations and literature to build upon. The datasets mentioned (CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, TCGA) are publicly available and widely used in medical ML research. The evaluation metrics are standard and well-defined. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) Bayesian neural networks can be computationally expensive, especially when performing multiple forward passes for uncertainty estimation, which may present scaling challenges with large medical datasets; (2) the proposal doesn't fully address the computational requirements or potential optimization strategies; (3) while the self-supervised auxiliary task is promising, its implementation details are not fully specified, raising questions about its practical execution; and (4) real-world validation in clinical settings would require additional resources and ethical considerations not fully elaborated in the proposal. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with reasonable resources and technical expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in medical AI: ensuring trustworthy multi-modal fusion when faced with unreliable or missing data. This has significant implications for clinical deployment, where data quality issues are common and incorrect predictions can have serious consequences. The dynamic modality reliability estimation approach could substantially improve robustness in real-world settings, potentially accelerating the adoption of AI in clinical practice. The interpretability aspects, particularly the uncertainty-aware attention maps, address a key barrier to clinical trust. The proposal also contributes methodologically to the field of uncertainty estimation in multi-modal learning, with potential applications beyond healthcare. The expected outcomes align well with the workshop's focus on trustworthy ML for healthcare, addressing multiple aspects including uncertainty estimation, explainability, and generalization. While the impact is primarily focused on improving existing fusion approaches rather than enabling entirely new capabilities, the potential clinical value of more reliable and interpretable fusion models is substantial. The proposal could have further strengthened its significance by more explicitly discussing how the approach might impact specific clinical workflows or decision-making processes."
