        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, particularly with the 'Theory of large language models' topic. It directly addresses the gap between theoretical models of in-context learning and practical prompt engineering observations, which is precisely the kind of theory-practice disconnect the workshop aims to address. The proposal specifically targets understanding why certain prompting techniques work, which connects to the workshop's goal of troubleshooting gaps between learning theory and practice. The focus on analyzing internal LLM representations to validate or challenge existing ICL theories is highly relevant to the workshop's interest in the 'theory of in-context learning'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (disconnect between ICL theory and prompt engineering practice), proposes a specific methodology (controlled experiments with systematic prompt variations and analysis of internal representations), and outlines expected outcomes (a framework explaining why certain prompting techniques succeed). The only minor ambiguity is in the specifics of which ICL theories will be tested and exactly how the internal representations will be analyzed, but this level of detail is reasonable for a research proposal at this stage."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows notable originality in its approach to connecting theoretical models of ICL with empirical prompt engineering heuristics. While both ICL theory and prompt engineering are active research areas, the systematic attempt to bridge these domains and explain prompt sensitivity through the lens of theoretical mechanisms is relatively fresh. The approach of correlating changes in internal LLM representations with theoretical predictions offers a novel methodology. However, the core components (analyzing attention patterns, studying prompt variations) have been explored separately in existing literature, making this more of a novel combination and extension of existing approaches rather than a completely groundbreaking concept."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. The proposed experiments involve manipulating prompts and analyzing model representations, which are standard techniques in NLP research. Access to LLM internals might be challenging for closed models, but open-source models like Llama, Mistral, or Pythia would be suitable. The methodology is clear and implementable, requiring primarily computational resources and expertise in LLM analysis, which are reasonably available in academic settings. The scope is well-defined and achievable, though the comprehensive analysis of multiple prompt engineering heuristics might require significant computational resources and time."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important gap in our understanding of LLMs. If successful, it would provide valuable insights into why certain prompting techniques work, potentially leading to more principled and reliable prompt engineering methods. This has significant practical implications given the widespread use of LLMs and the current reliance on empirical trial-and-error for prompt design. Theoretically, it could validate or challenge existing ICL theories, contributing to our fundamental understanding of how LLMs learn from context. The impact would extend to both academic research on LLM theory and practical applications in prompt engineering, making it a significant contribution to the field."
