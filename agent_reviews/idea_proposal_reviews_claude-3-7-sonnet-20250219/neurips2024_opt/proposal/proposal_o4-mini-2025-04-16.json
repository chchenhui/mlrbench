    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Scaling up optimization' and the relationship between optimization and model scaling. The proposal incorporates the core idea of developing optimization-aware scaling laws that model interactions between hyperparameters, model size, and optimizer choice. It builds upon the literature review by addressing the identified challenges of hyperparameter sensitivity, computational cost, and transferability. The methodology includes systematic experiments across varied model sizes and optimizers, with clear metrics for validation, which is consistent with the research idea's emphasis on deriving predictable scaling patterns for hyperparameters."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed, step-by-step approach with specific experimental designs, mathematical formulations for the scaling laws, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes and broader impacts are also clearly delineated. The proposal uses appropriate mathematical notation to formalize the scaling laws, making the technical aspects accessible. However, there could be more clarity on how the proposed scaling laws would interact with or build upon existing work like CARBS (mentioned in the literature review), and some details about the statistical validation methods could be more specific."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal offers significant novelty by explicitly integrating optimizer dynamics into scaling laws, an area that has been underexplored according to the literature review. While scaling laws for model and data size exist (as noted in the literature), the proposal extends these to include optimizer hyperparameters in a systematic way. The mathematical formulations for learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay scaling are innovative and go beyond existing approaches. The proposal also introduces a novel framework for hyperparameter recommendation based on these scaling laws. However, some elements like learning rate scaling with model size have been explored in papers mentioned in the literature review (e.g., 'Predictable Scale'), though this proposal takes a more comprehensive approach by considering multiple hyperparameters and optimizers simultaneously."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for the scaling laws are well-defined and based on established optimization principles. The experimental design includes appropriate controls and comparisons with baseline methods. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and relevant to the research objectives. However, there are some potential limitations in the soundness: (1) The proposal assumes power-law relationships for all hyperparameters without fully justifying this choice; (2) The range of model sizes (10^7 to 10^10 parameters) may not be sufficient to establish reliable scaling laws for the largest models (beyond 10^11 parameters); (3) The statistical analysis methods could be more detailed, particularly regarding how to handle potential non-linearities or interactions between hyperparameters."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but with significant challenges. The experimental grid design covers a wide range of model sizes (10^7 to 10^10 parameters), which would require substantial computational resources. Training multiple models across this range with various hyperparameter configurations could be prohibitively expensive, especially at the larger scales. The proposal acknowledges this by scaling the training budget (T gradient steps) to maintain constant compute across trials, but this may not be sufficient to ensure feasibility. Additionally, the validation on unseen scales and tasks requires fine-tuning large models on downstream tasks, which adds to the computational burden. While the methodology is technically sound, the practical implementation may require more resources than typically available to research teams, potentially limiting the comprehensive exploration proposed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in large-scale machine learning with potentially transformative impact. By developing optimization-aware scaling laws, it could dramatically reduce the computational resources, time, and environmental impact associated with hyperparameter tuning for large models. The expected outcomes include both theoretical contributions (validated scaling laws) and practical tools (an open-source Python package) that could benefit the broader ML community. The proposal quantifies the potential impact: 50-90% reduction in hyperparameter search cost while achieving within 1-2% of optimal validation loss, and savings of 'millions of GPU hours and megatons of COâ‚‚e at industrial scales.' These outcomes directly address the challenges identified in the literature review and align with the workshop's focus on scaling up optimization efficiently."
