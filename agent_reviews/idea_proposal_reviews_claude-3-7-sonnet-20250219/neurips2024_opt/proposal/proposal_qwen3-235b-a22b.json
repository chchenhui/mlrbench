        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the OPT 2024 workshop's focus on 'scaling up optimization' and specifically tackles the question of how hyperparameters should scale with model size. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, citing works like Xie et al. (2024), Li et al. (2025), and Fetterman et al. (2023), and builds upon their findings to develop a more comprehensive framework. The methodology clearly aims to derive optimization-aware scaling laws as outlined in the research idea, with a focus on learning rates, batch sizes, and momentum terms. The proposal also addresses the practical implications mentioned in the task description, such as reducing computational costs and environmental impact."

        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research questions and goals are explicitly stated in the introduction, and the methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the experimental setup, algorithmic steps, and validation procedures. The mathematical formulations of the scaling laws are presented clearly with appropriate notation. The proposal also includes specific metrics for evaluation and baselines for comparison. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as more details on how the framework will handle different architectures beyond Transformers and how the proposed scaling laws might interact with other hyperparameters not explicitly mentioned (e.g., weight decay, dropout rates)."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel approach by integrating optimization dynamics into scaling laws, which addresses a gap in current research. While individual aspects of hyperparameter scaling have been explored in prior work (as acknowledged in the proposal), the comprehensive framework that considers multiple hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, momentum) across different optimizers represents a fresh perspective. The proposal extends beyond existing work by considering the interactions between hyperparameters and their joint scaling behavior, rather than focusing on isolated parameters. However, the core mathematical formulations (power-law relationships) are similar to those used in existing scaling laws, and some of the methodological approaches build directly on established techniques rather than introducing entirely new paradigms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The mathematical formulations of the scaling laws are well-defined and based on established principles in optimization theory. The experimental methodology is comprehensive, with appropriate controls, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The use of regression analysis to derive scaling exponents is statistically sound, and the inclusion of Bayesian priors to prevent overfitting shows attention to statistical rigor. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and includes ablation studies to assess the impact of different factors. The validation strategy using both synthetic datasets and real-world LLM fine-tuning tasks provides a robust framework for testing the derived scaling laws. However, the theoretical justification for why power-law relationships should hold across different optimizers could be strengthened with more formal analysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and realistic goals. The experimental setup uses existing model architectures and datasets, and the computational requirements, while substantial, are within the capabilities of modern research infrastructure. The proposal wisely starts with smaller models to derive initial scaling laws before extrapolating to larger models, which is a practical approach given resource constraints. The framework for hyperparameter transfer is designed to be lightweight and integrable with existing tools like HuggingFace Transformers. However, the comprehensive experimentation across multiple model sizes, architectures, and optimizers will require significant computational resources, and the proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of how to manage these resources efficiently. Additionally, the validation on very large models (10B+ parameters) may be challenging without access to substantial computing infrastructure."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in large-scale machine learning: the efficient tuning of hyperparameters as models scale. If successful, the research could significantly reduce the computational resources required for training large models, with direct implications for democratizing access to LLM training and reducing environmental impact. The expected outcomes include both theoretical contributions (optimization-aware scaling laws) and practical tools (a framework for hyperparameter extrapolation), which would benefit both researchers and practitioners. The proposal quantifies the potential impact, suggesting a 10-100Ã— reduction in hyperparameter search costs and 15-20% faster convergence during LLM fine-tuning. These improvements would be substantial for the field, especially as models continue to grow in size. The work also contributes to the broader understanding of optimization dynamics in high-dimensional spaces, which has theoretical significance beyond the immediate practical applications."
