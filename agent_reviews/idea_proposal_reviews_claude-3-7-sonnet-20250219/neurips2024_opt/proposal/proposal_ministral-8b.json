    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Scaling up optimization' and the specific questions raised about model size-dependent learning rates and hyperparameter selection under fixed compute budgets. The proposal incorporates the core concept from the research idea of developing optimization-aware scaling laws that model interactions between optimizer hyperparameters, model size, and optimizer choice. The literature review is well-integrated, with the proposal building upon recent work in hyperparameter optimization for large models (e.g., Opt-Laws, Predictable Scale) while addressing the identified challenges of hyperparameter sensitivity and transferability. The methodology, including systematic experiments across model sizes and optimizers, is consistent with the approach outlined in the research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical and coherent manner. The introduction effectively establishes the background and significance of the research. The methodology section provides a detailed description of the research design, including data collection, algorithmic steps, and experimental design. The mathematical formulation is concise and understandable. However, there could be more specificity in some areas, such as the exact statistical and machine learning techniques to be used for modeling relationships and more details on the validation process for the derived scaling laws. The proposal would benefit from more concrete examples of how the optimization-aware scaling laws would be applied in practice."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by focusing on the integration of optimization dynamics into scaling laws, an area that has been relatively underexplored according to the literature review. While scaling laws for model and data size have been studied (as mentioned in the literature review with papers like 'Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models'), the explicit modeling of interactions between optimizer hyperparameters, model size, and optimizer choice represents a fresh perspective. The proposal builds upon existing work (such as 'Optimization Hyper-parameter Laws for Large Language Models' and 'Predictable Scale') but extends it by developing a comprehensive framework that encompasses multiple optimizers and hyperparameters. However, some aspects of the approach, such as using regression models to predict training outcomes, are relatively standard in the field, limiting the overall novelty."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on solid theoretical foundations. The research design is well-structured, with a clear progression from data collection to scaling law derivation and validation. The mathematical formulation, while simple, provides a reasonable starting point for modeling the relationship between model size, optimizer hyperparameters, and training outcomes. The experimental design includes appropriate baseline comparisons and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas that could benefit from more rigor. The proposal lacks detailed discussion of potential confounding factors or limitations of the approach. The statistical analysis methods are not specified in detail, and there is limited discussion of how the derived scaling laws would be validated across different domains or architectures. Additionally, while the proposal mentions tracking training loss and convergence rate, it does not address how generalization performance would be evaluated."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan, but with some significant challenges. The systematic experiments across different model sizes (from 1M to 100M parameters) and various optimizers are reasonable, but scaling to truly large models (billions of parameters) would require substantial computational resources not explicitly addressed in the proposal. The data collection process would be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for larger model sizes. The proposal does not provide a clear timeline or resource allocation plan, making it difficult to assess the overall feasibility. Additionally, the derivation of generalizable scaling laws that work across different architectures, tasks, and datasets may be more complex than anticipated. The validation on LLM fine-tuning tasks would require access to large pre-trained models and significant computational resources. While the core methodology is sound, the practical implementation may face challenges that are not fully addressed in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem in the field of machine learning, particularly in the context of large model training. As highlighted in the task description, efficient hyperparameter selection can save 'time and millions of dollars in training, plus helping reduce AI's environmental impact through reducing energy costs.' The proposed optimization-aware scaling laws have the potential to significantly reduce the computational resources required for hyperparameter tuning, which is a critical bottleneck in large model training. The research directly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, including hyperparameter sensitivity, computational cost, and transferability of hyperparameters. If successful, the outcomes would have broad impact across various domains of machine learning, contributing to more efficient and sustainable AI development. The theoretical insights into the interactions between model size, optimization algorithms, and hyperparameter settings would also advance our understanding of large-scale model training dynamics."
