    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on distribution shifts in foundation models, particularly the question of how to adapt models without sacrificing robustness. The proposed knowledge distillation framework with the original foundation model as a 'robustness teacher' perfectly matches the initial idea. The methodology incorporates relevant techniques from the literature review, including distillation approaches (Zhou et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023), self-distillation (Yang et al., 2024), and builds upon the findings of Kumar et al. (2022) regarding feature distortion during fine-tuning. The proposal also references benchmark datasets like WILDS mentioned in the task description and compares against methods like LoRA and WiSE-FT from the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated with three specific research questions that guide the investigation. The methodology section provides a detailed mathematical formulation of the approach, including the objective function, distillation loss, and activation regularization components. The expected outcomes section clearly outlines the anticipated results and evaluation metrics. The significance section effectively communicates the importance of the research. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific implementation details of generating perturbed inputs could be more thoroughly explained, (2) the exact layers chosen for activation regularization could be specified, and (3) the hyperparameter selection process for balancing the different loss components could be more detailed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel combination of existing techniques rather than a completely new approach. Its innovation lies in using the original foundation model as a 'robustness teacher' during fine-tuning and combining distillation with activation pattern regularization specifically to preserve out-of-distribution robustness. While knowledge distillation itself is not new, the application to preserving robustness during fine-tuning and the specific hybrid loss function that incorporates both perturbed inputs and domain-transformed samples represents a fresh perspective. The proposal builds upon existing methods like Discrete Adversarial Distillation (Zhou et al., 2023) and Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (Yang et al., 2024) but adapts them for the specific purpose of robustness preservation. The integration of activation pattern regularization with distillation specifically for foundation model fine-tuning is a relatively novel contribution, though individual components draw from established techniques."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established machine learning principles, with a clear mathematical formulation of the objective function and its components. The distillation loss using KL-divergence and the activation regularization using mean squared error are technically sound approaches. The research builds appropriately on prior work, particularly Kumar et al. (2022) for understanding feature distortion during fine-tuning and various distillation techniques from the literature. The evaluation plan using benchmark datasets like WILDS is appropriate for measuring robustness under distribution shifts. The proposal also acknowledges relevant baselines for comparison, including standard fine-tuning, WiSE-FT, SDFT, and LoRA. However, the proposal could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential limitations or failure modes of the approach, such as the computational overhead of using both teacher and student models or the potential challenges in balancing the different loss components."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed research is generally feasible with current technology and methods. The knowledge distillation framework and activation regularization techniques are well-established in the literature and can be implemented using standard deep learning libraries. The evaluation on benchmark datasets like WILDS is practical and achievable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The computational resources required for fine-tuning large foundation models like Llama-2-Chat while simultaneously using the original model as a teacher could be substantial, potentially limiting accessibility. (2) The generation of perturbed inputs and domain-transformed samples may require domain expertise for each specific application area. (3) The hyperparameter tuning process for balancing the different loss components could be time-consuming and challenging. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is implementable with reasonable resources, especially if focused on specific domains or smaller foundation models first before scaling to larger ones."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in the deployment of foundation models: the degradation of robustness during fine-tuning. This issue is particularly important in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal processing, and criminal justice, where distribution shifts are common and consequential. By developing a method to preserve robustness during fine-tuning, the research could significantly impact how foundation models are adapted for specialized applications. The approach could enable more reliable deployment of these models in real-world scenarios where distribution shifts are inevitable. The research directly contributes to the workshop's focus on understanding and mitigating robustness issues with foundation models. If successful, the method could become a standard practice for fine-tuning foundation models in critical applications, potentially influencing both academic research and industry practices. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the approach builds incrementally on existing techniques rather than proposing a fundamentally new paradigm, but the potential practical impact remains substantial."
