    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on distribution shifts in foundation models, particularly the challenge of preserving robustness during fine-tuning. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including the robustness teacher mechanism, hybrid loss function, and activation pattern preservation. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing the identified challenge of robustness degradation during fine-tuning (Kumar et al., 2022) and incorporating knowledge distillation approaches similar to those in Zhou et al. (2023) and Yang et al. (2024). The proposal's focus on high-stakes domains like healthcare and criminal justice aligns with the task description's emphasis on real-world applications where distribution shifts are consequential."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is described in detail, including mathematical formulations of the hybrid loss function and regularization term. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, providing a clear roadmap for implementation and assessment. The significance and expected outcomes are also clearly articulated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the specific techniques for generating out-of-distribution examples could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the activation pattern preservation and the distillation loss could be more explicitly explained, and (3) the proposal could provide more concrete examples of the types of distribution shifts being addressed in each high-stakes domain."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of a robustness teacher mechanism with a hybrid loss function and activation pattern preservation represents a fresh approach to preserving robustness during fine-tuning. While knowledge distillation for robustness is not entirely new (as seen in Zhou et al., 2023 and Yang et al., 2024), the proposal's focus on preserving robustness specifically during fine-tuning of foundation models and its application to high-stakes domains offers a novel perspective. The activation pattern preservation technique appears to be a relatively original contribution. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing methods like knowledge distillation and regularization techniques, rather than introducing entirely new paradigms, which limits its novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established machine learning principles. The hybrid loss function combining task-specific loss with distillation loss is mathematically well-formulated, and the activation pattern preservation technique is based on sound principles of regularization. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The proposal is supported by relevant literature, including recent work on knowledge distillation for robustness and the challenges of fine-tuning foundation models. The methodology is rigorous and comprehensive, covering data collection, algorithm design, and experimental validation. However, the proposal could benefit from a more detailed theoretical analysis of why the proposed approach would preserve robustness, and how the hyperparameters λ1 and λ2 should be selected to balance task performance and robustness."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Knowledge distillation is a well-established technique, and the proposed hybrid loss function can be implemented using standard deep learning frameworks. The use of existing benchmark datasets like WILDS reduces the data collection burden. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) generating meaningful out-of-distribution examples for diverse domains requires domain expertise and careful design, (2) the computational resources required for fine-tuning foundation models, even with efficient techniques, can be substantial, and (3) the activation pattern preservation technique may introduce additional computational overhead. The proposal acknowledges the need for computational efficiency but does not provide detailed strategies for addressing these challenges. Additionally, accessing and processing high-stakes domain data may present practical and ethical challenges that are not fully addressed in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in deploying foundation models in real-world applications, particularly in high-stakes domains where distribution shifts can have serious consequences. If successful, the research could significantly improve the robustness of fine-tuned models, enabling their safe and effective deployment in domains like healthcare and criminal justice. The potential impact extends beyond specific applications to the broader field of foundation model adaptation, addressing one of the key challenges identified in the workshop description. The proposal's focus on computational efficiency also enhances its significance, as it could make robust fine-tuning accessible to a wider range of practitioners. While the proposal has clear significance, its impact may be somewhat limited by the focus on specific types of distribution shifts and the need for domain-specific adaptations of the general framework."
