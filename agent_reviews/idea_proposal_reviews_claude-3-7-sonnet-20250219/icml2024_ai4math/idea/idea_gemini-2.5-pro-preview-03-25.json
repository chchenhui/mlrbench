        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Automated theorem proving' area mentioned in the workshop summary. The neuro-symbolic approach directly tackles the challenge of 'How do we build consistent theorem proving?' by combining neural networks for strategic guidance with symbolic provers for verification. The idea of proof sketching also indirectly relates to the 'intermediate step errors' problem mentioned in the task. However, it doesn't explicitly address autoformalization or theorem generation aspects, which are also key areas of interest in the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, approach, and expected benefits. The concept of using neural networks to generate proof sketches that guide symbolic ATP systems is explained coherently. However, some aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as: (1) the specific representation format for proof sketches, (2) how exactly the neural-generated sketches would interface with symbolic provers, and (3) the evaluation metrics that would determine success. These ambiguities prevent the idea from receiving a higher clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a fresh approach to automated theorem proving by combining neural and symbolic methods in a specific way - using neural networks to generate high-level proof sketches that guide symbolic provers. While neuro-symbolic approaches to theorem proving exist, the specific focus on proof sketching as an intermediate representation between neural pattern recognition and symbolic verification appears innovative. The approach leverages the complementary strengths of both paradigms in a way that isn't commonly explored in current ATP research. The idea doesn't completely reinvent the field but offers a novel combination of existing concepts with potential to advance the state of the art."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces several implementation challenges. First, creating a suitable dataset of theorem-proof sketch pairs would require significant effort, potentially involving manual annotation by mathematics experts. Second, training neural models to generate meaningful proof sketches is non-trivial, as mathematical reasoning is notoriously difficult for neural networks. Third, developing an effective interface between neural-generated sketches and symbolic provers presents technical challenges. While none of these obstacles are insurmountable (existing theorem provers, proof libraries, and neural architectures provide a foundation), they collectively represent substantial hurdles that would require considerable resources and expertise to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving - the explosion of search space when finding complex proofs. If successful, it could significantly advance the field by enabling ATP systems to tackle more complex theorems that are currently beyond reach. The approach has potential applications across mathematics, computer science, and formal verification. The neuro-symbolic nature of the solution aligns with broader trends in AI research seeking to combine the complementary strengths of neural and symbolic approaches. The impact could extend beyond theorem proving to other areas requiring complex reasoning, making this a highly significant research direction."
