        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on autoformalization and auto-informalization. It directly addresses the first bullet point of the task description by proposing a hybrid neural-symbolic approach to improve precision in translating between natural language proofs and formal proofs. The idea also touches on formal verification and code generation aspects mentioned in the task. The dual-process nature of the proposal (working on both formalization and informalization) perfectly matches the workshop's interest in bidirectional translation between natural and formal mathematical language. The proposal's emphasis on human-AI collaboration for mathematical discovery also aligns with the workshop's vision."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is specified with concrete components (neural networks, symbolic dependency graphs) and training methodology (using aligned corpora with reinforcement learning). The proposal defines specific metrics (graph alignment score and reversibility loss) to evaluate performance. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the exact mechanism of constraint satisfaction in the symbolic graphs and how the dependency structures are represented and manipulated. The integration between neural and symbolic components could also be explained more precisely."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel combination of neural and symbolic approaches for autoformalization. While both neural translation models and symbolic graph representations exist separately in the literature, their integration specifically for dual-process autoformalization represents an innovative approach. The concept of using dependency graphs to model logical relationships in mathematical proofs and jointly optimizing for both directions of translation is relatively fresh. However, hybrid neural-symbolic systems have been explored in related domains, and the fundamental techniques (LLMs, dependency graphs, reinforcement learning) are established methods being applied to a specific problem rather than groundbreaking new algorithms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. The availability of aligned corpora of natural and formal proofs is limited, though resources like arXiv papers and Lean4 libraries are mentioned. Building accurate dependency graphs from mathematical text requires sophisticated parsing and understanding of mathematical logic. The reinforcement learning component with human evaluators introduces scalability concerns. While the individual components (LLMs, graph representations) are implementable with current technology, their effective integration for this specific purpose would require significant engineering effort and mathematical expertise. The 50% reduction in manual correction is an ambitious target that may be difficult to achieve in practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in mathematical AI: bridging human-readable and machine-verifiable mathematical reasoning. Success would significantly impact formal verification, theorem proving, and mathematical education - all areas highlighted in the workshop description. The potential to reduce manual correction by 50% would substantially accelerate formal verification processes. Enabling seamless human-AI co-reasoning could democratize access to formal methods and accelerate mathematical discovery. The bidirectional nature of the approach (handling both formalization and informalization) makes it particularly valuable for human-AI collaboration scenarios. The significance is high because improvements in this area could have ripple effects across scientific domains that rely on mathematical formalism."
