    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs' and 'defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs.' The three-pronged approach (cross-modal consistency verification, modality-bridging adversarial training, and adaptive robustness mechanism) perfectly matches the original idea. The methodology builds upon the literature review, particularly drawing from works on cross-modal adversarial attacks and defenses (papers 3-10). The proposal also appropriately addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as cross-modal vulnerabilities, efficient adversarial training, and maintaining performance on benign inputs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented with sufficient technical detail, including mathematical formulations for the loss functions and training procedures. The experimental design, including datasets, baseline models, and evaluation metrics, is well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism by which the adaptive robustness component will identify attack patterns could be more precisely defined, (2) the integration of the three components could be more explicitly described, and (3) some technical details about the reinforcement learning approach for the adaptive mechanism could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a comprehensive framework that addresses cross-modal adversarial attacks in LMMs. The integration of three complementary approaches (consistency verification, modality-bridging training, and adaptive defense) into a unified framework is innovative. The adaptive robustness mechanism that dynamically adjusts defensive priorities based on detected attack patterns is particularly novel. However, individual components draw from existing concepts in the literature - cross-modal consistency training (paper 6), adversarial training (papers 1, 8), and adaptive defense mechanisms (paper 7). While the proposal combines these elements in a new way and applies them specifically to LMMs, it represents an evolution rather than a revolutionary approach to the problem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for the consistency loss, adversarial loss, and reward function are well-defined and appropriate for the stated objectives. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baseline models, and evaluation metrics. The training procedure is logically structured, and the use of reinforcement learning for the adaptive mechanism is justified. The proposal also acknowledges the need for hyperparameter optimization. However, there are some minor concerns: (1) the proposal could benefit from a more detailed analysis of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, (2) the theoretical guarantees of the proposed method could be more thoroughly discussed, and (3) the interaction between the different loss components could be analyzed more rigorously."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The datasets mentioned (COCO, Flickr30k, VQA, MSCOCO) are publicly available and widely used. The computational requirements, while substantial, are within the capabilities of modern GPU infrastructure. The implementation details, including the software stack and training procedure, are realistic. However, there are some challenges that might affect feasibility: (1) the computational cost of adversarial training on large multimodal models could be prohibitive, (2) the reinforcement learning component for adaptive defense might require extensive tuning and experimentation to work effectively, and (3) the integration of the three components might introduce unexpected complexities. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of these challenges and potential mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of multimodal machine learning - the vulnerability of LMMs to cross-modal adversarial attacks. This is particularly important for high-stakes applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and content moderation systems, where reliability across multiple modalities is crucial. The expected outcomes, including improved cross-modal consistency and integration in LMMs and adaptive defense mechanisms, would significantly advance the field of adversarial machine learning. The proposal also has broader implications for the security, privacy, and reliability of AI systems. The significance is well-aligned with the workshop's focus on 'defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs' and 'adversarial ML for good.' However, the proposal could more explicitly discuss how the framework might generalize beyond the specific datasets and attack types considered."
