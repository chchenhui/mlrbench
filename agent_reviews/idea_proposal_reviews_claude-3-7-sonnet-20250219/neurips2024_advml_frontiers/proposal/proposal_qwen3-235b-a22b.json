        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs' and 'defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs.' The three-pronged approach (cross-modal consistency verification, modality-bridging adversarial training, and adaptive robustness mechanism) perfectly matches the original research idea. The proposal also effectively incorporates and builds upon the literature, citing works like ProEAT (Lu et al., 2025), CrossFire (Dou et al., 2024), and universal attacks (Rahmatullaev et al., 2025) while addressing the identified gap in cross-modal defenses. The experimental design appropriately includes relevant datasets and baselines mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is logically organized into distinct modules with clear purposes. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly in sections 2.1-2.3 where the cross-modal consistency verification, adversarial training, and adaptive controller are described. The experimental design clearly outlines datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more detailed explanation of how the adaptive robustness controller integrates with the consistency module during inference, and more specific details on the implementation of the robust fusion module F_robust mentioned in section 2.3."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a comprehensive framework specifically targeting cross-modal vulnerabilities in LMMs. The Cross-Modal Adversarial Immunization (CMAI) approach offers a fresh perspective by combining three complementary mechanisms: cross-modal consistency verification, modality-bridging adversarial training, and adaptive robustness control. While individual components build upon existing concepts (e.g., adversarial training, consistency verification), their integration and specific application to cross-modal defense represents a novel contribution. The adaptive weighting mechanism that evolves during training based on attack patterns is particularly innovative. However, some elements like adversarial contrastive loss and cosine similarity for alignment are extensions of established techniques rather than completely new inventions. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work like ProEAT and CrossFire defense by explicitly addressing cross-modal integration vulnerabilities."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for cross-modal consistency verification, adversarial training, and the adaptive controller are well-defined and theoretically sound. The adversarial training approach properly extends existing methods like PGD to the cross-modal setting, and the loss functions are appropriately formulated. The experimental design includes comprehensive evaluation against both white-box and black-box attacks, with appropriate metrics (ASR, CMCS, task accuracy). The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of individual components. The proposal also acknowledges computational challenges with large models and proposes parameter-efficient fine-tuning as a solution. One minor limitation is that while the adaptive controller's update rule is specified, there could be more theoretical justification for why this particular formulation would lead to optimal defense adaptation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it will require moderate refinement and resources. The implementation builds on established techniques like adversarial training and contrastive learning, which have proven effective in related domains. The use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) for large models (10B-100B parameters) is a practical approach to manage computational constraints. The experimental design with existing datasets (BLIP-2, COIN) and comparison to established baselines is realistic. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional effort: (1) generating effective cross-modal adversarial examples at scale could be computationally intensive; (2) balancing the multiple loss terms (task accuracy and consistency) may require careful hyperparameter tuning; and (3) the real-time adaptation during inference might introduce latency concerns for deployment in time-sensitive applications like autonomous vehicles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of multimodal AI security with significant potential impact. Cross-modal vulnerabilities in LMMs represent a serious threat to high-stakes applications like autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and content moderation. By developing a comprehensive defense framework, this research could substantially improve the security and reliability of deployed LMMs. The expected outcomes include a 15-20% reduction in attack success rates while maintaining 95% accuracy on clean data, which would represent a meaningful advancement over current defenses. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications in security-critical domains and theoretical advancements in multimodal adversarial learning. The commitment to release adversarial datasets and tools will benefit the research community. While the impact is significant, it is focused on a specific aspect of LMM security rather than transforming the entire field of AI security."
