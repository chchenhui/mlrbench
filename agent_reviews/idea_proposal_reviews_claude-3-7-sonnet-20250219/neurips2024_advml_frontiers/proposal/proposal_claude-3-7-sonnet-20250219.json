    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs' and 'Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs.' The three-component framework (CMCVM, MBAT, ARM) precisely implements the three-pronged strategy outlined in the research idea. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing works like ProEAT (Lu et al., 2025), universal adversarial attacks (Rahmatullaev et al., 2025), CrossFire (Dou et al., 2024), and I2V attacks (Wei et al., 2021). The methodology addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly cross-modal vulnerabilities, efficient adversarial training, maintaining performance on benign inputs, and adaptive defense mechanisms."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The three main components of the framework (CMCVM, MBAT, ARM) are thoroughly explained with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design is comprehensive, detailing datasets, models, attack scenarios, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) some mathematical notations could be better defined (e.g., the exact definition of modality set M), (2) the integration of the three components during inference could be more explicitly described with a flowchart or algorithm, and (3) the hyperparameter selection process and sensitivity analysis could be more thoroughly addressed. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a unified framework specifically targeting cross-modal vulnerabilities in LMMs. The Cross-Modal Consistency Verification Module (CMCVM) offers a fresh approach to detecting misalignments between modalities, while the Adaptive Robustness Mechanism (ARM) provides an innovative dynamic defense adjustment system. The integration of these components into a cohesive framework represents a novel contribution. However, some individual components build incrementally on existing work: the Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training (MBAT) extends conventional adversarial training approaches, and the consistency verification concept has similarities to cross-modal consistency training mentioned in the literature review (White et al., 2023). The proposal acknowledges these connections while clearly distinguishing its approach. While not entirely groundbreaking, the proposal offers significant innovations in addressing the specific challenges of cross-modal adversarial attacks."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and soundness in its approach. The mathematical formulations for each component are well-defined and theoretically grounded, particularly the consistency scoring function, adversarial example generation, and adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, models, attack scenarios, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies and comparative analysis are well-planned to validate the contribution of each component. The proposal also acknowledges potential trade-offs between robustness and performance, planning to measure and optimize these aspects. The integration of the three components is logically structured, though some additional details on the interaction between components during inference would strengthen the technical foundation. Overall, the methodology is sound and well-justified, with only minor gaps in the technical formulation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the framework builds on established techniques like adversarial training and consistency verification, and the experimental design uses existing datasets and models. The computational requirements, while significant, appear manageable with modern GPU resources. However, several aspects present feasibility challenges: (1) implementing and optimizing the framework across five different LMMs (GPT-4V, LLaVA, CLIP, BLIP-2, ImageBind) will require substantial computational resources and engineering effort; (2) the adaptive mechanism requires real-time detection and response, which may introduce latency in practical deployments; (3) generating effective cross-modal adversarial examples at scale may be computationally intensive; and (4) the expected performance trade-off of less than 5% degradation on clean accuracy may be optimistic given the complexity of the defense. While ambitious, the proposal remains within the realm of feasibility with appropriate resources and potential scope adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical vulnerability in current LMMs that has significant real-world implications. Cross-modal adversarial attacks represent an emerging threat vector with potentially severe consequences in high-stakes applications like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, content moderation, and financial systems. The proposed framework offers a comprehensive solution to a problem that is currently underaddressed in the literature, as most existing defenses focus on single-modality protection. The expected outcomes include not only enhanced robustness against cross-modal attacks but also minimal performance degradation, transferable defense methodology, and real-time adaptation capabilities. The research has substantial technical impact (advancing adversarial ML defenses), practical impact (improving security in deployed systems), theoretical impact (deepening understanding of cross-modal representations), and societal impact (building more trustworthy AI systems). The identification of future research directions further enhances the significance by establishing a foundation for continued work in this critical area."
