    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'adversarial threats on LMMs' and 'cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs' by proposing a comprehensive defense framework specifically designed for multimodal models. The three-component approach (CMCV, MBAT, ARM) perfectly matches the three-pronged strategy outlined in the research idea. The proposal also builds upon and cites the relevant literature mentioned in the review, including works on cross-modal attacks (Dou et al., Rahmatullaev et al.) and defense strategies (White et al., Red et al., Black et al.). The methodology section clearly incorporates insights from these papers while extending beyond them to create a unified framework."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The three main components (CMCV, MBAT, ARM) are clearly defined with their respective functions and implementations. The experimental design section outlines baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies in a logical manner. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact implementation details of the ARM component could be more specific, particularly regarding how the gating network is trained; (2) the relationship between the three components during inference could be more explicitly described; and (3) some of the mathematical notation, while correct, might benefit from additional explanation for broader accessibility."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating three defensive approaches into a unified framework specifically targeting cross-modal vulnerabilities in LMMs. The Cross-Modal Consistency Verification (CMCV) builds upon existing consistency training methods but adds a novel verification mechanism. The Modality-Bridging Adversarial Training (MBAT) extends traditional adversarial training to explicitly target cross-modal transfer points, which is a fresh perspective. The Adaptive Robustness Mechanism (ARM) that dynamically reallocates defense resources is particularly innovative. However, each individual component draws significantly from existing techniques mentioned in the literature review (e.g., White et al.'s consistency training, Red et al.'s cross-modal adversarial training, and Black et al.'s adaptive defense). The primary novelty lies in their integration and specific application to cross-modal attacks rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithmic approaches."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates rigorous methodology. The mathematical formulations for cross-modal consistency verification, adversarial training, and adaptive defense are well-defined and theoretically justified. The min-max optimization framework for MBAT follows established adversarial training principles while extending them to the cross-modal setting. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical analysis procedures. The ablation studies are well-conceived to isolate the contributions of individual components. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical guarantees for the proposed methods are not explicitly discussed; (2) the computational complexity analysis could be more detailed; and (3) potential limitations of the approach, such as its effectiveness against adaptive attackers who are aware of the defense, could be more thoroughly addressed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The authors acknowledge computational constraints and propose practical solutions such as mixed-precision training, gradient accumulation, and fine-tuning only selected layers. The use of established datasets (MSCOCO, VQA v2.0, NLVR2) and existing LMM architectures (CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo) as starting points increases feasibility. However, several aspects raise moderate concerns: (1) the computational cost of the inner-loop attacks in MBAT could be prohibitive for very large models; (2) the real-time adaptation required by ARM might introduce latency issues in deployment scenarios; and (3) the proposal assumes access to model gradients, which might not be available in black-box settings. While these challenges don't render the approach impractical, they would require careful engineering and optimization to implement successfully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of multimodal AI security with potentially high impact. As LMMs become increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications (autonomous driving, medical diagnostics, content moderation), protecting them against cross-modal adversarial attacks is of paramount importance. The expected outcomes—15-25% improvement in robust accuracy with minimal clean accuracy degradation—would represent a significant advancement over current defenses. The framework's modular design and compatibility with various LMM architectures enhance its practical significance. The potential to establish a new standard for LMM security and shift the community's focus toward integrated multimodal resilience further underscores its importance. The open-source implementation and pre-trained robust checkpoints would benefit both academic and industry practitioners. While the impact is substantial, it is primarily focused on defensive techniques rather than offering transformative insights into the fundamental nature of cross-modal vulnerabilities."
