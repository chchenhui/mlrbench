    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'adversarial threats on LMMs' and 'cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs' by proposing a comprehensive framework (CMAI) to defend against multi-domain attacks. The three core components (cross-modal consistency verification, modality-bridging adversarial training, and adaptive robustness mechanism) align perfectly with the original idea. The proposal also builds upon the literature review effectively, citing and extending work from papers like ProEAT [1], CrossFire [3], and I2V [4]. The methodology incorporates concepts from cross-modal consistency training [6] and adaptive defense mechanisms [7] as mentioned in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that some technical details could be more explicitly linked to specific prior works."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and significance. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of each component with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design outlines clear baselines, models, attacks, and metrics for evaluation. The expected outcomes are specific and quantifiable. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for how the cross-modal consistency verification module corrects detected misalignments is not fully explained; (2) The reinforcement learning approach for training the adaptive robustness mechanism could be more detailed; and (3) Some technical terms (e.g., KL divergence) are used without brief explanations for potential non-expert readers. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is logically structured and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by introducing a comprehensive framework that combines three innovative components to address cross-modal adversarial attacks. The integration of cross-modal consistency verification with modality-bridging adversarial training and an adaptive robustness mechanism represents a fresh approach to defending LMMs. The adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts defense priorities based on attack patterns is particularly innovative. However, individual components draw significantly from existing work: the consistency verification builds on [6], the adversarial training extends methods from [1] and [8], and the adaptive mechanism has similarities to [7]. While the proposal creates a novel combination and extends these approaches in meaningful ways (particularly in the cross-modal context), it doesn't introduce fundamentally new paradigms. The mathematical formulations, while well-presented, largely adapt existing techniques rather than proposing entirely new ones."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodologies. The mathematical formulations for cross-modal consistency verification and modality-bridging adversarial training are rigorous and theoretically justified. The loss functions and optimization objectives are clearly defined and appropriate for the tasks. The experimental design includes comprehensive baselines, relevant models, and appropriate evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential trade-offs between robustness and clean accuracy, which shows awareness of fundamental challenges in adversarial ML. The reinforcement learning approach for the adaptive mechanism is conceptually sound, though it could benefit from more detailed formulation. The ablation studies planned will help isolate the contributions of each component, strengthening the scientific rigor. The proposal builds logically on established methods in the literature while extending them to the cross-modal domain in a technically sound manner."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The datasets and models mentioned (COCO, Visual Genome, CLIP, Flamingo) are publicly available and commonly used in multimodal research. The adversarial attack methods referenced are established in the literature. The mathematical formulations suggest implementable algorithms. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) Training large multimodal models with adversarial techniques can be computationally expensive, and the proposal doesn't address computational requirements or optimization strategies; (2) The reinforcement learning approach for the adaptive mechanism may require significant tuning and could face convergence challenges; (3) The expected improvement of 30-50% reduction in Attack Success Rate compared to state-of-the-art methods is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve consistently across different attack types; (4) The adaptation latency target of <100ms may be challenging to achieve in practice, especially for large models. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and methods, though it may require substantial computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in securing LMMs against cross-modal adversarial attacks, which is highly relevant given the increasing deployment of these models in high-stakes applications. The significance is well-articulated in both the introduction and expected outcomes sections. If successful, the CMAI framework could substantially improve the robustness of LMMs in safety-critical domains like autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and content moderation. The expected 30-50% reduction in attack success rate would represent a meaningful advancement in the field. The proposal also emphasizes broader impacts, including ethical AI considerations and contributions to the research community through open-source releases. The work directly addresses multiple priority topics from the workshop call, including 'adversarial threats on LMMs,' 'cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities,' and 'defensive strategies.' While the impact would be significant for the specific problem of cross-modal adversarial attacks, it doesn't necessarily transform the broader field of adversarial machine learning or multimodal AI."
