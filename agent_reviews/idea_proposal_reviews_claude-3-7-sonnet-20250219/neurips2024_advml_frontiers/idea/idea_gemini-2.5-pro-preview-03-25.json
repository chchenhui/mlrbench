        "justification": "The research idea on Cross-Modal Semantic Poisoning Attacks aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs' topic explicitly mentioned in the workshop call. The proposal also touches on several other relevant topics including 'Adversarial threats on LMMs', 'Privacy and security in LMMs', and 'Ethical implications of AdvML in LMMs'. The focus on how poisoning in one modality affects another modality is precisely the kind of cross-modal vulnerability research that the workshop is seeking. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address defensive strategies, though it mentions that findings would 'inform robust data sanitization and defense strategies'."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The title clearly communicates the focus on cross-modal semantic poisoning attacks on LMMs. The motivation section effectively establishes the research gap by noting that while data poisoning is known, cross-modal implications in LMMs remain underexplored. The main idea section clearly articulates the proposed attack method, providing a concrete example (manipulating images to induce biased text generation). The methodology is outlined with sufficient detail to understand the approach. The only minor ambiguities are in the specifics of how the evaluation metrics would be defined and what exact techniques would be used for the poisoning, but these are reasonable omissions given the space constraints of a research idea summary."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposed research demonstrates high originality by introducing a novel attack vector that specifically exploits the cross-modal nature of LMMs. While data poisoning attacks exist in the literature, the cross-modal aspect—where poisoning in one modality (e.g., images) affects behavior in another modality (e.g., text)—represents a significant innovation. This approach leverages the unique architecture of multimodal models in a way that hasn't been thoroughly explored. The idea extends beyond traditional unimodal poisoning attacks by exploiting the semantic bridges between modalities in LMMs. This represents a genuinely new direction in adversarial machine learning research that could reveal previously unknown vulnerabilities specific to multimodal architectures."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The researchers would need access to LMMs for fine-tuning, which is increasingly available through open-source models like LLaVA, CLIP, or other multimodal variants. Creating poisoned datasets is a well-established practice in adversarial ML research. However, there are moderate challenges: (1) Fine-tuning large multimodal models requires substantial computational resources; (2) Designing subtle poisoning techniques that transfer across modalities may require significant experimentation; (3) Measuring and quantifying the success of cross-modal attacks will require developing new evaluation frameworks. These challenges are substantial but not insurmountable with appropriate resources and expertise in both adversarial ML and multimodal learning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical vulnerability in increasingly deployed multimodal AI systems. As LMMs become more prevalent in real-world applications (content moderation, search engines, assistive technologies), understanding cross-modal poisoning attacks has significant implications for security, safety, and trust. The findings could reveal fundamental weaknesses in how multimodal models integrate information across modalities, potentially leading to new defensive strategies and training protocols. The work could influence how datasets for multimodal models are curated and validated. Additionally, this research could inform regulatory frameworks and standards for AI safety as it exposes a novel attack vector that current defenses might not address. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical AI safety considerations in deployed systems."
