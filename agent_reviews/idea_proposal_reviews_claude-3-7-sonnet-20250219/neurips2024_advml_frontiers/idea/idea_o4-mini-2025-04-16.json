        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the intersection of adversarial machine learning and large multimodal models. It directly tackles 'Cross-modal adversarial vulnerabilities for LMMs' and 'Defensive strategies and adversarial training techniques for LMMs' which are explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal also touches on 'LMM-aided AdvML' by using LMMs themselves to generate adversarial examples. The idea of using LMMs to generate hard negatives for improving cross-modal robustness is highly relevant to the workshop's focus on the bidirectional relationship between AdvML and LMMs."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a three-step framework: adversarial generation, reinforced selection, and adversarial training. The methodology is well-articulated with specific details about how the LMM would be prompted to create hard negatives and how these would be incorporated into training. The expected outcomes are also clearly stated. The only minor ambiguities lie in the specifics of the reward model design and exactly how the 'minimal semantic or visual edits' would be constrained, but these are reasonable details to leave for full paper development."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to adversarial training for multimodal models. While adversarial training itself is not new, the closed-loop system where an LMM generates adversarial examples for another multimodal model represents an innovative approach. The concept of using an LMM's generative capabilities to create semantically meaningful adversarial examples, rather than relying on gradient-based perturbations or human annotation, is particularly novel. The reinforcement mechanism for selecting the most effective adversarial examples adds another layer of innovation. The approach isn't entirely without precedent, as generative models have been used for adversarial example creation before, but the specific application to cross-modal robustness and the closed-loop nature of the system represents a fresh direction."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology, though it presents some implementation challenges. The three components (generation, selection, training) all use established techniques. LMMs can be prompted to generate variations, reward models are common in RLHF pipelines, and adversarial training is well-established. However, several practical challenges exist: 1) Effectively prompting LMMs to generate subtle but impactful adversarial examples may require significant engineering, 2) The reward model needs careful design to balance attack success with diversity, 3) Computational resources required for the closed-loop system could be substantial, especially if multiple iterations are needed. Despite these challenges, the approach doesn't require fundamentally new technologies, making it implementable with current resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant problem in multimodal AI systems: their vulnerability to cross-modal adversarial attacks. As LMMs become more prevalent in real-world applications, ensuring their robustness becomes increasingly important. The proposed approach could have substantial impact by: 1) Automating the generation of semantically meaningful adversarial examples, reducing the annotation burden, 2) Improving cross-modal robustness in a way that's more aligned with real-world perturbations than traditional adversarial training, 3) Establishing a framework for self-improving adversarial defenses that could be extended to other modalities and model types. The significance extends beyond the immediate application to broader implications for secure AI deployment in critical systems where robustness guarantees are essential."
