    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The Causal-MFM proposal aligns well with the task's focus on explainable Medical Foundation Models. It directly addresses the 'Explainable MFMs' topic by proposing a framework to make medical AI systems more transparent and interpretable through causal reasoning. The idea also touches on 'Robust Diagnosis' by addressing covariate shifts and 'Human-AI Interaction' through clinician collaboration for validation. However, it doesn't explicitly address some other topics mentioned in the task description such as patient privacy, resource constraints, or fairness considerations, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and anticipated outcomes. The Causal-MFM framework is defined with specific components (Causal Discovery, Causal Explanation Module, Evaluation). However, some technical details remain somewhat abstract - for instance, how exactly the causal graphs will be constructed from multimodal data, or how the counterfactual analysis will be implemented in practice. The proposal would benefit from more concrete examples of how the causal reasoning would work in specific medical scenarios beyond the brief mentions provided."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The integration of causal reasoning into Medical Foundation Models represents a novel approach to explainability. While explainable AI and causal inference are established research areas individually, their combination specifically for medical foundation models appears innovative. The proposal moves beyond conventional correlation-based explainability methods (like attention maps) to focus on causal mechanisms, which is a significant shift in approach. The idea of embedding explainability directly into the model architecture rather than applying it post-hoc is also relatively novel. However, causal discovery in complex medical data is not entirely new, which slightly reduces the novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research faces several challenges. Causal discovery in complex, multimodal medical data is notoriously difficult due to confounding factors, missing data, and the complexity of biological systems. The proposal acknowledges the need for domain-specific constraints, but doesn't fully address how it will overcome the fundamental challenges of causal inference in observational medical data. Collaboration with clinicians for validation is valuable but potentially resource-intensive. The technical implementation of counterfactual analysis at the scale of foundation models may also present computational challenges. While the overall direction is feasible, these significant hurdles prevent a higher feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is substantial. Explainability is a critical barrier to the adoption of AI in healthcare, and addressing it through causal reasoning could have far-reaching implications. The proposal correctly identifies regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act) as a driver for this work. If successful, this approach could fundamentally change how AI systems are integrated into clinical workflows, potentially improving patient outcomes while maintaining clinician trust and oversight. The focus on actionable explanations rather than mere correlations addresses a genuine need in medical AI. The potential impact on healthcare delivery, patient safety, and regulatory approval of AI medical systems justifies the high significance score."
