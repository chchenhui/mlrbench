    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on GenAI trustworthiness in healthcare by developing a comprehensive benchmarking framework that evaluates safety, fairness, and policy compliance. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the original idea: synthetic data generation, multi-modal testing, clinician feedback loops, and explainability metrics. It builds upon the literature review by extending Bt-GAN's fairness mechanisms, discGAN's multi-modal capabilities, and HiSGT's hierarchical approaches while addressing the identified gaps in policy compliance and clinician feedback. The methodology section thoroughly explains how these components integrate into a cohesive framework that addresses the workshop's three main topics: GenAI use cases, trustworthiness/risks, and policy compliance."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are articulated in a logical sequence. The technical formulations are presented with appropriate mathematical notation and are accompanied by explanatory text. The pseudocode sections enhance understanding of the algorithmic components. The four-module architecture (SDG, MMTS, CFL, ECS) provides a clear organizational framework. However, there are a few areas where additional clarity would be beneficial: (1) the relationship between the synthetic data generation and the test suite could be more explicitly defined; (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'calibration error') are used without full explanation; and (3) the experimental design section could benefit from more specific details on evaluation metrics and statistical analysis methods. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is well-articulated and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in several aspects. The integration of synthetic data generation, multi-modal testing, clinician feedback, and policy compliance into a unified dynamic benchmarking framework represents a fresh approach not fully addressed in the literature. The extension of existing GAN architectures (Bt-GAN, discGAN, HiSGT) into a policy-aware synthetic data generator is innovative. The clinician feedback loop with active learning for model refinement is particularly novel. However, many of the individual components build incrementally on existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. For example, the fairness metrics, explainability approaches, and GAN architectures largely adapt established techniques to the healthcare context. While the combination and application are novel, the technical innovations in each component are moderate rather than groundbreaking."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological approaches. The mathematical formulations for the GAN-based synthetic data generation, fairness metrics, and compliance scoring are rigorous and properly defined. The integration of clinician feedback through a calibration network is theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate controls, cross-validation, and statistical testing. The proposal also shows awareness of potential limitations and addresses them through the dynamic nature of the framework. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the approach: (1) the privacy guarantees could be more formally established with theoretical bounds; (2) the relationship between synthetic data quality and benchmark validity could be more thoroughly analyzed; and (3) the statistical power calculations for the clinician panel size are not provided. Despite these gaps, the overall technical foundation is solid and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible approach but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the researchers clearly specify resource requirements (8 GPUs, 10 clinicians, software tools) and break down the methodology into implementable modules. The use of existing architectures (Bt-GAN, discGAN) as starting points increases feasibility. However, several aspects raise concerns: (1) recruiting and maintaining a panel of 10 clinical experts for feedback is challenging and potentially expensive; (2) generating high-quality synthetic data across multiple modalities (text, imaging, genomics) requires significant expertise and computational resources; (3) the integration of evolving policy constraints into the framework demands continuous legal expertise; and (4) the timeline for implementation seems optimistic given the complexity. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed risk mitigation plan and a phased implementation approach to increase feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in healthcare AI evaluation with potentially high impact. The lack of comprehensive, dynamic benchmarks for GenAI in healthcare is a significant barrier to safe clinical adoption. By creating standardized evaluation methods that incorporate fairness, explainability, and policy compliance, the framework could substantially accelerate trustworthy AI integration in healthcare. The expected outcomes align directly with the workshop's goals of enhancing trust and ensuring policy compliance. The proposal's significance is further strengthened by its potential to: (1) inform regulatory guidelines for AI in healthcare; (2) provide hospitals with practical tools for evaluating GenAI systems; (3) establish standards that could influence industry practices; and (4) foster multidisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. The long-term vision for continuous updates and consortium governance enhances the sustainable impact of the work."
