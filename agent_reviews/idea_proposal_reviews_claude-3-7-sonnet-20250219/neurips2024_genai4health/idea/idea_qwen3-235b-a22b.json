    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description, particularly with Topic 2 (Trustworthiness and risks) as it directly proposes a novel benchmark framework for GenAI safety in healthcare. The idea addresses the core concerns mentioned in the workshop description about trust issues and policy compliance in healthcare GenAI applications. It also touches on Topic 3 by considering regulatory compliance (HIPAA, EU AI Act). The multidisciplinary approach involving clinicians, ethicists, and policymakers matches the workshop's encouragement for involving diverse stakeholders. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly discuss specific use cases (Topic 1), though it does reference clinical workflows."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined problem (fragmented benchmarks for GenAI trustworthiness in healthcare) and a structured solution (a three-dimensional framework covering safety, reliability, and ethical disparities). The methodology is clearly outlined, mentioning specific datasets and validation approaches. The expected outcomes are also well-defined. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific metrics that would constitute the standardized scorecard and the exact implementation details of the adversarial testing and fairness audits, which would benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in proposing a unified, multidimensional framework for evaluating GenAI trustworthiness in healthcare, which addresses the current fragmentation in assessment approaches. The integration of safety, reliability, and ethical considerations into a single benchmarking system is innovative. However, each individual component (adversarial testing, fairness audits, etc.) builds upon existing methodologies rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques. The primary innovation lies in the holistic integration and healthcare-specific adaptation rather than in developing entirely new evaluation paradigms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with existing technologies and methodologies. The proposal mentions specific datasets (MIMIC-III, EHRs) that are available for research, and the evaluation approaches (adversarial testing, fairness audits) have established precedents in the ML community. The multidisciplinary validation approach is practical but challenging, requiring coordination among clinicians, ethicists, and policymakers. Implementation would require considerable effort in standardizing metrics across diverse healthcare contexts and ensuring clinical relevance. The scope is ambitious but achievable with appropriate resources and expertise in both ML and healthcare domains."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in healthcare AI deployment. As GenAI increasingly enters high-stakes medical applications, a standardized framework for assessing trustworthiness is essential for patient safety and regulatory compliance. The potential impact is substantial: it could accelerate responsible adoption of GenAI in healthcare, provide developers with clear guidelines for improvement, assist regulators in enforcement, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes while minimizing risks. The significance is heightened by the timeliness of the work, as healthcare systems globally are grappling with how to safely integrate GenAI technologies while maintaining public trust."
