    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the central theme of the workshop on representational alignment by developing a framework (RIFE) that investigates when and why intelligent systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposal incorporates the contrastive-adversarial domain adaptation techniques mentioned in the literature review, particularly drawing from the CDA framework. It addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as data modality differences and false negatives in contrastive learning, by proposing specific solutions like the adversarial alignment stage and the refined contrastive loss. The experimental design includes comparing biological systems (primate visual cortex, human language processing) with artificial systems (CNNs, Transformers, LLMs), which aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on cross-domain representational alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The problem formulation is precise, with well-defined mathematical notation for the representations and transformation functions. The two-stage approach (adversarial alignment and contrastive refinement) is explained in detail with appropriate equations. The experimental design clearly outlines the systems to be compared, stimuli to be used, and analyses to be performed. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the specific architecture details of the feature extractors and domain discriminator are not fully specified, (2) the process for selecting semantically equivalent stimuli across domains could be elaborated further, and (3) some of the hyperparameters (like λ_adv and λ_cont) lack guidance on how they would be determined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining adversarial domain adaptation with contrastive learning specifically for the purpose of representational alignment across disparate neural systems. While the individual techniques (adversarial training, contrastive learning) are established in the domain adaptation literature, their application to the problem of representational alignment between biological and artificial neural systems is innovative. The refinement of the contrastive loss to mitigate false negatives through clustering is a thoughtful extension of existing methods. However, the core technical approach largely builds upon existing domain adaptation techniques (as cited in the literature review) rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic innovations. The novelty lies more in the application domain and the specific combination of techniques rather than in the development of entirely new methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks. The mathematical formulation of the adversarial and contrastive losses is correct and follows standard practices in the field. The two-stage approach is well-justified, with the adversarial stage aligning global distributions and the contrastive stage refining local structure. The proposal acknowledges and addresses key challenges like false negatives in contrastive learning through the clustering-based refinement. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive, including both technical measures (e.g., representational similarity correlation) and functional measures (e.g., correlation with behavioral similarity). The experimental design includes appropriate control conditions and comparisons with existing methods. The only minor weakness is that the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes and how they would be addressed, particularly regarding the stability of adversarial training."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The adversarial and contrastive learning components are well-established techniques with available implementations. The data sources mentioned (fMRI recordings, neural network activations) are accessible through existing datasets or can be generated with standard models. However, there are several aspects that increase the complexity of implementation: (1) obtaining paired stimuli across biological and artificial systems that are truly semantically equivalent may be challenging, (2) the quality of fMRI or MEG data for fine-grained representational analysis can be variable, (3) the computational resources required for training the feature extractors on large-scale neural data could be substantial, and (4) the adversarial training process may face stability issues that require careful tuning. While these challenges are manageable, they do increase the implementation complexity and may require additional resources or methodological refinements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the field of representational alignment with potentially far-reaching implications. If successful, the RIFE framework would provide a principled way to compare representations across fundamentally different neural systems, which has been a major limitation in current research. The significance spans multiple fields: in neuroscience, it could reveal universal computational principles across species and brain regions; in AI, it could guide the development of more human-like systems and improve interpretability; in cognitive science, it could bridge computational models with empirical observations. The practical applications are substantial, including improved model design, enhanced brain-computer interfaces, and novel evaluation metrics for AI systems. The framework also has the potential to systematically increase or decrease alignment between systems, directly addressing one of the key questions in the workshop description. The interdisciplinary nature of the work further amplifies its significance by facilitating collaboration across traditionally separate research communities."
