        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly aligned with the task description for the Workshop on Representational Alignment. It directly addresses the central theme of when and why intelligence systems learn aligned representations and how to intervene on this alignment. The proposal specifically tackles the question of whether representational alignment indicates shared computational strategies (the first bullet point in the task description) and proposes new measurement approaches (the second bullet point). The idea of developing a taxonomy of alignment patterns addresses the need for more robust and generalizable measures (third bullet point), while the targeted interventions component relates to systematically increasing or decreasing alignment (fourth bullet point). The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively discuss the implications of alignment changes (fifth bullet point), though it does mention safety-critical components."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured with clear motivation and a three-part methodological framework. The proposal defines a concrete approach using orthogonal probing classifiers, targeted interventions, and a taxonomy of alignment patterns. The distinction between surface-level and deep structural alignment is introduced, though it could benefit from more explicit definition. The concept of 'alignment profiles' versus scalar metrics is clear and compelling. While the overall approach is well-defined, some technical details remain somewhat abstract - for instance, the specific implementation of the orthogonal probing classifiers and how exactly the taxonomy would be developed could be further elaborated. Nevertheless, the core idea and its components are presented with sufficient clarity to understand the proposed research direction."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The combination of traditional alignment metrics with targeted probing techniques for causal analysis represents a fresh approach to the problem. Most current alignment research focuses on correlation-based measures, while this proposal explicitly aims to uncover causal relationships between representational components. The concept of developing alignment profiles rather than scalar metrics is innovative and addresses a recognized limitation in the field. The three-part methodological framework integrates techniques from different domains in a novel way. While individual components (probing classifiers, ablation studies) exist in the literature, their integration into a comprehensive framework for comparative causal analysis of representations between biological and artificial systems is innovative. The proposal builds upon existing work but offers a distinct and original perspective on how to advance representational alignment research."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. While probing classifiers and intervention techniques are established methods in ML, applying them comparatively between biological and artificial systems introduces significant complexity. For biological systems, obtaining the necessary fine-grained neural data and performing targeted interventions ethically and technically is challenging. The causal analysis component is particularly ambitious given the complexity of both neural networks and biological brains. Developing a comprehensive taxonomy of alignment patterns would require extensive empirical validation across multiple domains and systems. The proposal would likely need to start with simplified biological models or well-characterized neural circuits before scaling to more complex biological systems. The technical components are individually feasible, but their integration and application across biological-artificial boundaries presents substantial implementation challenges that would require significant resources and interdisciplinary expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental question at the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and cognitive science with potentially far-reaching implications. Understanding how computational strategies differ between biological and artificial systems despite similar representations could significantly advance AI interpretability, which is crucial for safety and trustworthiness. The ability to identify where and how representations diverge could lead to more targeted improvements in AI systems, particularly for safety-critical applications. For cognitive science, this approach could provide new insights into how biological brains process information. The development of more nuanced alignment metrics that go beyond scalar values could become a new standard in the field, influencing how researchers evaluate models across disciplines. The potential impact extends to AI safety, neuroscience, cognitive modeling, and human-AI interaction, making it a highly significant research direction that could influence multiple fields simultaneously."
