        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the central theme of the workshop by proposing a novel framework to measure and potentially intervene on representational alignment between different systems. The idea specifically tackles the question of 'How can we develop more robust and generalizable measures of alignment that work across different domains and types of representations?' which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. It also addresses how to 'systematically increase (or decrease) representational alignment' through targeted regularization, another key question in the workshop. The proposal spans machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science domains, matching the interdisciplinary nature of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address all the questions listed in the task description, such as the implications of alignment changes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (limitations of fixed probes), proposes a solution (bi-level optimization framework with meta-probe networks), outlines the methodology (inner and outer loop optimization), and specifies evaluation domains and expected outcomes. The technical approach involving probe functions f and g is explained with sufficient detail to understand the general mechanism. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific similarity objectives to be used (only examples are given), the exact nature of the regularization in the outer loop, and more details on how the meta-probe would generalize to unseen representational pairs. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving the highest clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by introducing an adaptive meta-probing framework that learns optimal probe functions dynamically, rather than relying on fixed, hand-designed probes. This approach represents a fresh perspective on measuring representational alignment. The bi-level optimization framework for this specific purpose appears innovative, as does the concept of a meta-probe that generalizes across different representational pairs. The combination of self-supervised learning with probe complexity regularization in this context is also novel. While meta-learning and probing techniques exist separately in the literature, their combination for cross-domain representational alignment represents a novel synthesis. It's not entirely revolutionary as it builds upon existing concepts in meta-learning and representation analysis, but it applies them in a new and potentially impactful way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The bi-level optimization framework and meta-learning approaches are established techniques in machine learning. The proposed evaluation on vision-neuroscience, language-behavior, and multi-modal benchmarks is realistic given existing datasets. However, there are implementation challenges that need to be addressed. Training meta-learning systems can be computationally expensive and potentially unstable. Finding the right balance in the regularization of probe complexity to avoid overfitting while maintaining expressivity will require careful tuning. Additionally, the generalization to unseen representational pairs might be difficult to achieve robustly. The proposal would benefit from more details on how these challenges will be addressed. Overall, while the idea is implementable, it will require considerable expertise and resources to execute successfully."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in the field of representational alignment. Current alignment metrics often fail to capture the complex transformations between different representational systems, limiting our understanding of shared computational strategies. The proposed adaptive meta-probing framework could significantly advance how we measure and understand alignment across diverse domains and modalities. The expected outcomes—a unified alignment score, insights into cross-system computations, and a tool for targeted alignment intervention—would be valuable contributions to multiple fields including machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science. This work could bridge important gaps between artificial and biological intelligence research, potentially leading to more interpretable AI systems and better models of biological cognition. The ability to systematically modify alignment through targeted regularization could have far-reaching implications for transfer learning, brain-computer interfaces, and multi-modal systems."
