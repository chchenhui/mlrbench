        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly applies Lagrange duality principles to address model explanation and interpretation in deep learning, which is explicitly mentioned as an underexploited area in the workshop description. The proposal bridges classical duality concepts with modern deep learning challenges, focusing on sensitivity analysis for interpretability - precisely the kind of connection the workshop seeks to foster. The idea also touches on robustness against adversarial shifts, which relates to the practical applications section of the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (lack of transparent mechanisms in deep networks), proposes a specific approach (using Lagrange duality to find minimal perturbations), and outlines expected outcomes. The mathematical framing is precise - formulating feature importance as a constrained optimization problem with dual variables quantifying feature influence. The only minor ambiguities lie in the technical details of how the dual problem would be solved via back-propagation in 'augmented network architectures,' which could benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by applying Lagrange duality specifically to neural network interpretability in a way that appears underexplored. While duality principles themselves are well-established and some work exists on sensitivity analysis for neural networks, the framing of feature importance through the lens of constrained optimization with Lagrange multipliers and the proposed batch-efficient computation approach seems innovative. The integration of classical convex duality with deep learning interpretability represents a fresh perspective that addresses the workshop's explicit concern about the lack of duality applications in modern deep learning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing technology and mathematical frameworks. Lagrange duality is well-understood, and back-propagation in neural networks is a standard technique. However, there are implementation challenges to consider: (1) solving the dual problem efficiently at scale for complex networks may require significant engineering; (2) establishing provably tight importance bounds could be mathematically challenging for non-convex neural networks; (3) the claim of improved robustness against adversarial shifts would need careful validation. These challenges are substantial but likely surmountable with appropriate expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in AI - the interpretability of deep neural networks - which has implications for trustworthiness, safety, and regulatory compliance. The proposed approach could significantly advance the field by providing theoretically grounded, efficient explanations with provable guarantees, which current methods often lack. If successful, this work could bridge an important gap between classical optimization theory and modern deep learning practice, potentially influencing how model explanations are generated across various high-stakes applications. The alignment with the workshop's goal of revitalizing duality principles in modern machine learning further enhances its significance."
