        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the application of Lagrange duality for model explanation and interpretation in deep learning, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as an underexploited area. The proposal specifically targets the challenge of applying duality principles to nonconvex problems (DNNs) through convex relaxation techniques, which perfectly matches the workshop's focus on extending duality to modern machine learning challenges. The idea also connects to model understanding and explanation, which are listed as key topics of interest."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (lack of principled quantification in interpretability methods), proposes a specific approach (using convex relaxations to enable dual variable computation), and outlines expected outcomes. The explanation of how dual variables can quantify sensitivity to input perturbations is particularly clear. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how exactly the convex relaxation techniques would be applied to specific neural network architectures, and what mathematical guarantees would be provided by the relaxations. These details would likely be elaborated in a full paper."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by applying duality principles to deep neural network interpretability in a way that hasn't been thoroughly explored. While duality is a well-established concept in optimization and convex relaxations have been used for neural networks, their combination specifically for interpretability through sensitivity analysis represents a fresh approach. The dual perspective on both maximal and minimal effects on class scores provides a novel lens compared to traditional gradient-based methods. The innovation lies in bridging mathematical optimization theory with practical deep learning interpretability needs, creating a principled framework where most existing approaches are heuristic."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces some notable challenges. While convex relaxation techniques exist, applying them effectively to modern deep neural networks with millions of parameters could be computationally intensive. The proposal acknowledges this by suggesting semi-definite programming or quadratic approximations, but these might only be tractable for smaller networks or require significant approximations that could compromise the theoretical guarantees. The validation across vision and NLP models adds another layer of complexity, as different architectures might require different relaxation strategies. That said, the approach could be demonstrated on simplified networks or specific layers first, making incremental progress feasible even if the full vision isn't immediately achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant gap in the field of AI interpretability. Current interpretability methods often lack mathematical rigor and guarantees, which this approach aims to provide through duality principles. If successful, it could establish a more principled foundation for understanding deep learning models, which is crucial for high-stakes applications like healthcare mentioned in the proposal. The dual sensitivity framework could offer insights into model robustness that current methods miss, potentially advancing trustworthy AI. The significance extends beyond theoretical contributions to practical applications where understanding prediction stability is critical for deployment and regulatory compliance."
