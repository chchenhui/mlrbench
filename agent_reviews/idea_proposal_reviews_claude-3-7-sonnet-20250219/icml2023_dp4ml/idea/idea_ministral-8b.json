    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, specifically addressing the application of Lagrange duality for model explanation and interpretation in deep learning. This directly connects to the workshop's focus on duality principles for model understanding and explanation. The proposal recognizes that Lagrange duality can measure sensitivity to perturbations, which the task description explicitly mentions as an underexploited area. The idea falls squarely within the 'Practical applications of duality principle' section of the workshop topics, particularly under 'Model understanding, explanation and interpretation.' However, it doesn't explicitly address some other aspects mentioned in the task like knowledge adaptation or transfer learning, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-step approach (formulation of dual problem, sensitivity analysis, and interpretation/visualization) provides a logical framework. However, there are some ambiguities that prevent a higher score. The proposal lacks specific mathematical formulations of how Lagrange duality would be applied to deep neural networks, which are typically non-convex. It doesn't clearly address how the dual problem would be formulated for complex architectures or how computational challenges would be handled. The connection between sensitivity analysis and interpretability tools could be more precisely defined with concrete examples of the proposed visualization techniques."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea shows good originality by applying Lagrange duality specifically to deep learning interpretability, an area that the task description identifies as underexplored. The approach of using duality principles for sensitivity analysis in deep learning models represents a fresh perspective compared to more common interpretability methods like LIME, SHAP, or gradient-based approaches. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that duality principles have been extensively studied in optimization and some aspects of machine learning before. The proposal doesn't clearly articulate how this approach fundamentally differs from existing sensitivity analysis methods or how it overcomes limitations of previous duality-based approaches in non-convex settings typical of deep learning. It combines existing concepts in a new way rather than introducing entirely new theoretical frameworks."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The feasibility of the research idea faces significant challenges. While Lagrange duality is well-established for convex problems, deep learning models are inherently non-convex, making direct application of traditional duality principles problematic. The proposal doesn't address how to overcome the duality gap in non-convex settings or how to efficiently compute dual solutions for large-scale neural networks. Practical implementation would likely require approximations or relaxations that might compromise the theoretical guarantees of duality, but these aren't discussed. The computational complexity of solving dual problems for modern deep learning architectures could be prohibitive. The proposal mentions developing visualization tools but doesn't address the scalability challenges when dealing with high-dimensional input spaces typical in deep learning applications."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is substantial. Interpretability remains one of the major challenges in deep learning adoption, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance. Successfully applying duality principles to enhance model interpretability could have far-reaching impacts on trust, accountability, and regulatory compliance for AI systems. The proposal correctly identifies the growing need for transparency in AI and how mathematical rigor from optimization theory could strengthen the theoretical foundations of explainable AI. If successful, this approach could bridge the gap between the theoretical optimization community and practical deep learning applications. The potential to provide principled sensitivity measures would be valuable for debugging models and understanding their failure modes. However, the significance depends on overcoming the feasibility challenges noted earlier."
