    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the ICML Duality Principles workshop's focus on applying duality concepts to model understanding and explanation in deep learning. The proposal leverages Lagrange duality for model explanation and sensitivity analysis, which is explicitly mentioned as an underexploited area in the task description. The research formulation follows the outlined idea of framing feature importance as a constrained optimization problem with Lagrange multipliers. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with references to set-valued sensitivity analysis, metric-based sensitivity, and physics-informed approaches that inform the methodology. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions applications in healthcare and autonomous systems, it could have more explicitly connected to some specific papers in the literature review that address these domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The mathematical formulation is precise, with well-defined notation for the primal problem, Lagrangian, and dual function. The algorithmic implementation is broken down into three concrete stages that are easy to follow. The experimental design specifies datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the connection between the linearization approach and the non-convexity challenge could be more explicitly explained, (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'Grassmannian') are used without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with the terminology, and (3) the exact mechanism for how dual variables translate to feature importance weights could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach by applying Lagrange duality principles to deep neural network interpretability. While sensitivity analysis and feature attribution methods exist, the formulation of feature importance as a primal-dual optimization problem with certificate-based sensitivity bounds represents a fresh perspective. The integration of duality theory with modern deep learning architectures addresses a gap identified in the task description. The proposal innovatively connects classical optimization techniques with neural network interpretability, extending beyond gradient-based or perturbation-based methods. The approach of using dual variables as direct measures of feature influence is original. However, some components build upon existing work in adversarial robustness and linearization techniques, which slightly reduces the novelty score from perfect."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established mathematical principles of Lagrangian duality. The formulation of the primal and dual problems follows standard optimization theory. The methodology for computing sensitivity certificates from dual variables is theoretically justified. However, there are some concerns: (1) The linearization of the neural network (f(x + δ) ≈ f(x) + J_x^T δ) is a significant approximation that may not hold well for larger perturbations, potentially affecting the tightness of the duality gap; (2) The claim of 'tight lacunae-free duality gaps' requires more rigorous justification given the non-convex nature of deep networks; (3) The proposal acknowledges the non-convexity challenge but doesn't fully address how the local linearization affects global interpretability guarantees. These limitations prevent a higher soundness score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with a clear implementation strategy. The three-stage algorithmic implementation provides a concrete pathway to realize the method. The use of automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration for Jacobian computation addresses computational efficiency concerns. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets and baselines for validation. However, several feasibility challenges remain: (1) Computing Jacobians for large networks and high-dimensional inputs could still be computationally intensive despite GPU acceleration; (2) The augmented network training approach may introduce additional complexity and training time; (3) The proposal claims 30-40% faster explanation computation, but this may vary significantly across model architectures and datasets; (4) The approach to handling non-convexity through linearization may work well locally but could face challenges with highly non-linear decision boundaries. These practical implementation challenges slightly reduce the feasibility score."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need for interpretable, efficient, and certifiable feature attribution methods in deep learning. The significance is high for several reasons: (1) It bridges the gap between classical optimization theory and modern deep learning interpretability; (2) The certificate-based sensitivity bounds could provide formal guarantees lacking in current methods; (3) The potential applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous systems could have substantial real-world impact; (4) The approach could contribute to improved adversarial robustness and model debugging. The expected outcomes of higher AOPC scores and faster computation would represent meaningful advances in the field. The proposal aligns well with the workshop's goal of revitalizing duality principles in modern machine learning. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on post-hoc interpretability rather than fundamentally changing how models are designed or trained."
