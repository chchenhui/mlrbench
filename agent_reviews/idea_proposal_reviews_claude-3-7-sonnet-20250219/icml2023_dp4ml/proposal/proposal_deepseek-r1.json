    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the ICML Duality Principles workshop's focus on applying duality concepts to model understanding and explanation in deep learning. The proposal leverages Lagrange duality for model interpretation, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as an underexploited area. The research methodology thoroughly develops the idea of using Lagrangian duality to quantify feature importance through sensitivity analysis, consistent with the initial research idea. The proposal also effectively incorporates and builds upon the literature review, citing works like Wang et al. (2024), Pizarroso et al. (2023), and Hwang & Son (2021) to establish the research gap and theoretical foundations. The only minor inconsistency is that some referenced papers in the proposal (e.g., Boyd et al., 1994; Bhatt et al., 2021) were not included in the provided literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the three-phase methodology is presented in a detailed, step-by-step manner. The mathematical formulations are precise, with clear notation and explanations of the primal-dual relationship. The pseudocode for Algorithm 1 effectively summarizes the computational approach. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for embedding dual variables as trainable parameters could be more explicitly described; (2) the discussion of non-convexity handling is somewhat brief given its importance to the approach; and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'SAUCE' metric) are introduced without full explanation. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality by systematically integrating Lagrange duality into deep learning interpretability, an approach that has been underutilized according to both the task description and the proposal's own literature review. The framing of feature importance as a constrained optimization problem with dual sensitivity certificates represents a fresh perspective on interpretability. The augmented backpropagation scheme that efficiently computes dual sensitivity scores is particularly innovative. While individual components (sensitivity analysis, Lagrangian methods) have precedents in the literature, their combination and application to interpretability in deep networks is novel. The proposal acknowledges existing work (e.g., Pizarroso et al., 2023) but clearly differentiates its contributions. The novelty is somewhat constrained by the fact that duality principles themselves are well-established in optimization theory, but their application in this context represents a meaningful innovation."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is built on solid theoretical foundations from optimization theory and sensitivity analysis. The mathematical formulation of the primal-dual relationship is technically correct, and the proposed algorithm for computing sensitivity scores is logically sound. The approach to addressing non-convexity through local duality and convex relaxation is theoretically justified, though somewhat briefly explained. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets and baseline comparisons, with well-defined metrics for evaluation. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) the proof of local strong duality for ReLU networks is mentioned but not fully elaborated; (2) the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the dual optimization process could be more rigorously established; and (3) the handling of potential numerical instabilities in the dual updates is not thoroughly addressed. While these issues don't invalidate the approach, they do represent areas where the theoretical rigor could be strengthened."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with a clear implementation strategy. The augmented backpropagation approach leverages existing deep learning frameworks, making implementation practical. The experimental design using standard datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and comparison against established baselines is realistic and achievable. The computational efficiency claims (2-3Ã— faster than SHAP/LIME) seem plausible given the backpropagation-based approach. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) scaling to very large networks might be more difficult than suggested, particularly for the convex relaxation of non-convex layers; (2) the optimization of dual variables might face convergence issues in practice, especially for complex decision boundaries; (3) the human evaluation component via Amazon Mechanical Turk would require careful design to ensure meaningful results; and (4) the expected 15-20% improvement in explanation stability under adversarial attacks seems optimistic without more detailed justification. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal infeasible, but rather indicate areas requiring careful attention during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in deep learning interpretability, which is essential for deploying neural networks in high-stakes domains. The significance is well-aligned with the workshop's focus on applying duality principles to modern machine learning challenges. The potential impacts are substantial: (1) providing mathematically grounded explanations with certifiable bounds on feature importance; (2) enabling more efficient and robust interpretability methods; and (3) advancing model robustness by linking sensitivity to adversarial perturbation analysis. The broader impacts on transparent AI systems and ethical AI applications are meaningful and well-articulated. The work could significantly influence both theoretical research on duality in non-convex settings and practical applications of interpretable AI. The proposal directly addresses key challenge #5 from the literature review regarding robustness to adversarial perturbations. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on post-hoc explanation rather than inherently interpretable model design, but this is a reasonable scope decision given the research objectives."
