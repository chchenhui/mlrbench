    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description, particularly with the third focus area that explicitly questions whether 'modularity in structures guarantees compositional generalization.' The proposal directly addresses this by systematically evaluating different modular strategies (adapters, prompts, sparsity) across multiple domains (vision, language, RL) - exactly matching the workshop's interest in cross-domain modularity approaches. The idea also touches on the first focus area by investigating the conditions under which models excel in compositional generalization. The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively address the fourth focus on continual learning environments, though the mention of 'dynamic real-world scenarios' suggests some awareness of this aspect."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a specific question (relationship between structural modularity and compositional generalization), a methodological approach (systematic evaluation framework with controlled experiments), and expected outcomes. The proposal clearly defines what will be measured (parameter isolation, inter-module sparsity) and how these metrics will be correlated with task performance. The experimental design involving out-of-distribution testing is well specified. The only minor ambiguities are in the details of how 'modularity' will be precisely quantified and what specific theoretical principles of 'compositional invariance' will be explored, which would benefit from further elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its systematic approach to evaluating the direct relationship between structural modularity and compositional generalization. While modular architectures themselves are not new, the proposal's focus on isolating and measuring the specific contribution of modularity to generalization represents a fresh perspective. The cross-domain evaluation spanning vision, language, and reinforcement learning is particularly innovative, as most existing work tends to focus on a single domain. The proposed metrics for quantifying modularity also show originality. However, the core techniques mentioned (adapters, prompts, sparsity) are established approaches, and the research builds upon rather than fundamentally reimagines the concept of modularity in neural networks."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. The modular components mentioned (adapters, prompts, sparse networks) are well-established techniques with existing implementations. The evaluation framework, while comprehensive, uses standard approaches like controlled experiments and out-of-distribution testing. The cross-domain nature of the study increases complexity but remains manageable given the specified scope. The theoretical analysis component might present some challenges, as formalizing the relationship between structural modularity and compositional invariance is non-trivial, but the empirical components are straightforward to implement. The research team would need expertise across multiple domains (vision, language, RL), but this is reasonable for a collaborative project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a fundamental question in compositional learning that has significant implications for model design and deployment. Understanding whether and how structural modularity contributes to compositional generalization could substantially influence the architecture of future AI systems, particularly foundation models. The potential guidelines for integrating modular components could lead to more efficient, robust, and interpretable systems. The cross-domain nature of the study enhances its significance by providing insights applicable across multiple fields. The work could bridge an important gap between theory and practice in compositional learning. While not completely revolutionary, the findings would likely have substantial impact on how researchers approach modularity in deep learning systems and could lead to meaningful improvements in model generalization capabilities."
