    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description, particularly with the third focus area that explicitly questions whether 'modularity in structures guarantees compositional generalization.' The proposal directly addresses this by investigating the relationship between modular adapter architectures and compositional generalization in foundation models. It also touches on the first focus area by examining contexts where foundation models might excel in compositional generalization. The idea is highly relevant to the workshop's overall theme of compositional learning and its application to foundation models."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (foundation models struggling with compositional generalization), the approach (systematic investigation of modular structures), and expected outcomes (empirical evidence, theoretical framework, and design principles). The taxonomy of adapter architectures with varying degrees of parameter sharing and routing mechanisms is well-defined. However, some minor ambiguities exist around the specific benchmarks to be used and how the theoretical framework will be developed, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by systematically investigating the relationship between modularity and compositional generalization in foundation models. While adapters and compositional generalization have been studied separately, the systematic taxonomy of adapter architectures specifically designed for compositional tasks and the focus on understanding which modular structures support which types of compositional generalization represents a fresh perspective. However, it builds upon existing concepts of adapters and compositional learning rather than introducing entirely new paradigms, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Adapters are well-established techniques for foundation models, and there are existing benchmarks for compositional generalization. The proposed systematic evaluation across different adapter architectures is implementable with standard research infrastructure. The three-part deliverable (empirical evidence, theoretical framework, and design principles) is ambitious but achievable. The main challenge might be in developing a comprehensive theoretical framework that explains all empirical findings, but this doesn't significantly impact overall feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical gap in our understanding of foundation models: their ability to generalize compositionally. The significance is high because: 1) it tackles a fundamental limitation of current AI systems, 2) the findings could influence how we design future foundation models and adapters, 3) improved compositional generalization would impact numerous downstream applications, and 4) the theoretical framework could advance our understanding of compositionality in neural networks. The practical design principles for 'compositional adapters' could have immediate impact on existing foundation models, making them more robust and adaptable with minimal additional training."
