        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses the third focus area of the workshop by investigating the relationship between structural modularity and compositional generalization. The proposal also touches on the second focus area by aiming to develop model-agnostic strategies for compositional learning. The idea of using causal abstractions to guide modular learning is relevant to understanding when and why models might excel in compositional tasks (first focus). Additionally, the mention of continual learning without catastrophic forgetting connects to the fourth focus area. The only minor gap is that it could more explicitly address how the proposed approach would handle continual learning environments beyond just mentioning it as a motivation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The core concept of aligning modular components with causal abstractions is presented coherently. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further elaboration. For instance, the mechanism for 'dynamically identifying compositional primitives' and how exactly the 'modular routing mechanisms' will be enforced to align with these primitives could be more precisely defined. The description of the synthetic benchmark (*CausalComposiBench*) is somewhat vague regarding its specific design and evaluation metrics. These ambiguities prevent the idea from receiving a higher clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates strong originality by explicitly connecting three important concepts: modularity, causality, and compositionality. While modular learning approaches (like mixture-of-experts) and causal learning are established research areas, their integration specifically for compositional generalization represents a fresh perspective. The proposed self-supervised framework that aligns modular components with causal abstractions appears to be a novel approach. The creation of a synthetic benchmark (*CausalComposiBench*) with programmable compositions also adds to the novelty. The idea doesn't completely reinvent the field but offers a compelling new direction by combining existing concepts in an innovative way."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate implementation challenges. On the positive side, it builds upon established techniques like contrastive learning and mixture-of-experts, which have well-developed implementations. Creating synthetic benchmarks is also feasible with current technology. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Automatically identifying compositional primitives in a self-supervised manner is non-trivial and may require significant engineering effort; (2) Ensuring that modular routing aligns with causal abstractions presents both theoretical and practical challenges; (3) The theoretical analysis linking module specialization to invariance under distribution shifts is ambitious and may be difficult to formalize rigorously. While not impossible, these challenges suggest considerable effort would be required to fully implement the proposed approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in machine learning: enabling models to recombine learned concepts in novel contexts. This has broad implications across multiple domains mentioned in the task description, including cross-lingual reasoning and vision-language tasks. If successful, the approach could significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between modularity and compositionality, which is explicitly highlighted as an important research question in the workshop description. The proposed benchmark could become a valuable resource for the community. The model-agnostic strategy for modular learning could influence how foundation models are designed and trained. While the immediate practical impact might be limited to research settings initially, the long-term potential for improving generalization in real-world applications is substantial."
