    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the fourth focus area of the workshop ('Paths Forward') by exploring challenges in extending compositional learning to continual learning environments. The proposal fully implements the main idea of dynamic component adaptation through three integrated mechanisms: concept drift detection, incremental component learning, and adaptive composition. The methodology leverages recent work cited in the literature review, particularly MCD-DD (Wan et al. 2024) for drift detection and concepts from Korycki & Krawczyk (2021) for parameter isolation. The proposal comprehensively addresses the challenge of maintaining compositional capabilities in non-stationary environments, which is central to both the task description and research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to experimental design. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly in sections describing representation of primitives, concept drift detection, and adaptive composition mechanisms. The algorithmic summary provides a clear step-by-step procedure for implementing the Dynamic Component Adaptation framework. The experimental design section thoroughly outlines datasets, baselines, metrics, and implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the distinction between 'real' and 'virtual' drift could be more explicitly defined, and (2) some technical details about the meta-learning step in the adaptive composition mechanism section could be elaborated further to ensure complete reproducibility."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly original approach by explicitly bridging compositional and continual learning, which represents a significant gap in current research. The Dynamic Component Adaptation framework introduces several novel elements: (1) adapting concept drift detection methods specifically for compositional representations, (2) developing component-specific generative replay and parameter isolation techniques, and (3) creating meta-learning enhanced adaptive composition mechanisms. While individual techniques like generative replay and parameter isolation exist in continual learning literature, their application to compositional primitives and integration into a unified framework represents a fresh perspective. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on the adaptation of both primitives and composition mechanisms simultaneously, rather than treating them as static entities or addressing them in isolation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for representing primitives, detecting concept drift, and adapting composition mechanisms are rigorous and well-justified. The extension of Maximum Concept Discrepancy to compositional embeddings is technically sound, as is the approach to incremental component learning. However, there are some areas where additional theoretical justification would strengthen the proposal: (1) the threshold determination for drift detection (τ and τ_new) seems somewhat heuristic and could benefit from more formal analysis, (2) the balance between generative replay and parameter isolation approaches could be more thoroughly analyzed in terms of their theoretical trade-offs, and (3) the meta-learning approach for composition adaptation could be more rigorously connected to existing theory. Overall, while the technical approach is strong, these gaps prevent it from receiving the highest score for soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The implementation details are specific enough to be actionable, with appropriate model architectures, hyperparameters, and evaluation protocols. The experimental design includes realistic datasets and benchmarks that could be constructed from existing resources. However, there are some implementation challenges that affect the feasibility score: (1) training generative models for each component might be computationally expensive, especially as the number of components grows, (2) the meta-learning approach for composition adaptation adds another layer of optimization complexity, and (3) creating evolving compositional benchmarks with controlled drift characteristics requires significant engineering effort. While these challenges are manageable, they do increase the implementation complexity and resource requirements, making the proposal somewhat less straightforward to execute than a simpler approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap at the intersection of compositional and continual learning, with far-reaching implications for AI systems operating in dynamic environments. The ability to adapt both primitive components and composition mechanisms over time is essential for deploying robust AI in real-world scenarios where concepts naturally evolve. The expected outcomes would significantly advance the field by: (1) enabling compositional models to maintain performance in non-stationary environments, (2) reducing catastrophic forgetting while preserving compositional generalization capabilities, and (3) establishing new benchmarks and evaluation protocols for this emerging research area. The broader impact section convincingly outlines applications in robotics, NLP systems, and scientific discovery, demonstrating the proposal's potential to influence multiple domains. The contribution to understanding how compositional structures can be maintained and adapted over time represents a substantial advancement in our theoretical understanding of lifelong learning systems."
