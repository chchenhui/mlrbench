    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Paths Forward' focus area from the workshop by tackling the challenges of extending compositional learning to continual learning environments. The Dynamic Component Adaptation (DyCA) framework incorporates all elements mentioned in the research idea: concept drift detection, incremental component learning, and adaptive composition mechanisms. The proposal also thoroughly integrates the literature on drift detection methods (MCD-DD, DriftLens, Neighbor-Searching Discrepancy) cited in the literature review. The methodology section clearly builds upon these works, with specific citations to the relevant papers. The proposal maintains consistency throughout, with the introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes all focused on the core challenge of enabling compositional models to adapt in non-stationary environments."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and broken down into three distinct components. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of each component with algorithmic steps and mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas where clarity could be improved: (1) Some mathematical notations are introduced without sufficient explanation (e.g., the exact meaning of α_ij in the relational graph monitoring); (2) The connection between the three modules could be more explicitly articulated to show how they interact in the overall framework; (3) Some technical terms (e.g., 'virtual drift' vs. 'real drift') are used without definition. Despite these minor issues, the proposal remains highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of concept drift detection specifically tailored for compositional representations is innovative, particularly the focus on tracking changes within the compositional graph structure rather than just in raw input distributions. The Compositional Drift Detection (CDD) approach extends existing drift detection methods to address the unique challenges of compositional learning. The self-modifying attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts based on drift signals represents a novel approach to adaptive composition. The combination of generative replay with parameter isolation for incremental component learning in a compositional context is also innovative. While individual techniques like MMD, VAE replay, and attention mechanisms build upon existing work, their integration and adaptation for continual compositional learning represents a fresh perspective. The proposal doesn't claim to introduce entirely new algorithms but rather adapts and combines existing approaches in a novel way to address an important gap in the literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall. The mathematical formulations for drift detection, incremental learning, and adaptive composition are well-grounded in established methods like Maximum Mean Discrepancy, Variational Autoencoders, and attention mechanisms. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The threshold θ for drift detection is described as 'dynamically adjusted' without specifying the adjustment mechanism; (2) The sparsity constraint in the incremental learning loss function could benefit from more justification; (3) The meta-compose network's architecture and training procedure are not fully detailed. The proposal acknowledges relevant theoretical foundations and cites appropriate literature, but some claims about performance (e.g., '80-90% precision' in expected outcomes) would benefit from preliminary results or more detailed justification. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and experimental design. The implementation builds on established models (DETR, BERT) and datasets (CLEVRER, Continual ImageNet, TED Talks), which increases practicality. The algorithmic steps are detailed enough to guide implementation. However, several challenges may affect feasibility: (1) The computational resources required for training both the main models and the generative replay components could be substantial; (2) The complexity of integrating three sophisticated modules (drift detection, incremental learning, and adaptive composition) may introduce implementation difficulties; (3) The modification of existing datasets to introduce temporal shifts adds another layer of complexity. The proposal does not discuss potential fallback strategies if certain components prove more challenging than anticipated. The timeline for implementation is also not specified, making it difficult to assess whether the scope is manageable within a reasonable research period. Despite these concerns, the modular nature of the framework allows for incremental development and testing, which enhances overall feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in compositional learning research: the ability to maintain compositional generalization in non-stationary environments. This challenge is explicitly highlighted in the workshop's 'Paths Forward' focus area and represents a significant barrier to real-world deployment of compositional models. The DyCA framework has broad potential impact across multiple domains where environments evolve over time, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing. The theoretical contributions around formalizing compositional drift and the relationship between modularity and generalization address fundamental questions in the field. The practical outcomes—including reduced catastrophic forgetting and sustained accuracy after multiple domain shifts—would represent meaningful advances in continual learning. The proposal also contributes to the research community through new benchmarks for evolving compositionality. The work bridges multiple research areas (compositional learning, continual learning, drift detection) in a way that could inspire new directions in each field. Overall, the significance of this research is high both for advancing theoretical understanding and enabling practical applications of compositional learning in dynamic real-world settings."
