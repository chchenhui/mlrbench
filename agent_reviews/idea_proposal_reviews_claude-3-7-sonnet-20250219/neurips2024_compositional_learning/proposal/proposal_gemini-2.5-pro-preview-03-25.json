    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Paths Forward' by tackling the challenges of extending compositional learning to continual learning environments. The proposed DCA-CCL framework incorporates all key elements from the research idea: concept drift detection for compositional representations, incremental component learning, and adaptive composition mechanisms. The proposal also effectively integrates the literature on drift detection, citing and building upon the same papers mentioned in the literature review (Wan et al., 2024; Greco et al., 2024). The methodology section thoroughly elaborates on how these components will work together to enable compositional models to adapt in non-stationary environments, which is precisely what was outlined in the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations for drift detection, incremental learning, and adaptive composition mechanisms. The experimental design is comprehensive, including baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. The only minor issues preventing a perfect score are: (1) some technical details in the methodology could benefit from more concrete examples to illustrate how the framework would operate in practice, and (2) the relationship between the three main components (drift detection, incremental learning, and adaptive composition) could be more explicitly defined in terms of their interactions and dependencies."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly novel approach by explicitly bridging compositional learning and continual learning, two areas that have largely been studied separately. The DCA-CCL framework introduces several innovative elements: (1) composition-aware concept drift detection that specifically targets changes in component semantics or relationships, (2) adaptation of continual learning techniques like EWC and generative replay to operate on compositional structures, and (3) dynamic composition mechanisms that can adjust based on detected drifts. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on the adaptation of both components and composition rules, rather than assuming static primitives. While individual techniques like drift detection and regularization methods build upon existing approaches, their integration and adaptation for compositional structures represents a significant innovation. The proposal could have scored higher if it had proposed entirely new algorithmic approaches rather than adapting existing ones."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a strong theoretical basis drawing from both compositional learning and continual learning literature. The technical formulations for drift detection using MMD and parameter regularization with EWC are correct and appropriate. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in scaling the approach to complex real-world scenarios with many components, (2) there's limited discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed methods, especially for the drift detection component, (3) while the proposal mentions using generative replay, it doesn't fully elaborate on how to ensure the quality and diversity of generated samples for complex compositional structures, and (4) the theoretical guarantees for preventing catastrophic forgetting in compositional settings are not thoroughly explored."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and evaluation protocols. The use of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets (C-MNIST-Seq, C-CLEVR-Seq) is a practical approach to create controlled environments for testing compositional drift. The implementation of the framework builds upon established methods in drift detection and continual learning, which increases feasibility. However, several challenges might affect implementation: (1) creating datasets with well-defined compositional drift patterns could be more complex than described, (2) the computational resources required for methods like generative replay might be substantial, especially for complex visual domains, (3) the proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the potential growth in model complexity as new components are added over time, and (4) detecting subtle changes in compositional relationships might require more sophisticated approaches than the proposed MMD-based methods. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present significant hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap at the intersection of compositional learning and continual learning, with far-reaching implications for developing AI systems that can maintain performance in dynamic environments. The significance is high because: (1) it directly tackles a key challenge identified in the workshop call regarding extending compositional learning to continual settings, (2) the ability to adapt compositional structures over time is essential for real-world applications like robotics, autonomous systems, and interactive agents, (3) the proposed framework could significantly advance our understanding of how modularity and adaptability interact in learning systems, and (4) the findings could inform the design of more robust foundation models that can handle evolving data distributions. The practical applications outlined in the expected impact section are compelling and diverse, spanning multiple domains where compositional adaptation would be valuable. The proposal also contributes methodologically by developing new benchmarks and evaluation protocols for continual compositional learning."
