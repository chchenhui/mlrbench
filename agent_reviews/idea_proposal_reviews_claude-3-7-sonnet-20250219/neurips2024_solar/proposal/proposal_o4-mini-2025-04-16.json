    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the SoLaR workshop's focus on transparency, explainability, and applications for low-resource languages. The methodology incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including adapting SHAP and LIME for morphological features, community-driven interface design, and dual evaluation metrics for technical robustness and user trust. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by citing relevant techniques (GlotLID-M for language identification) and addressing the key challenges identified (limited data, linguistic diversity, code-switching, community engagement, and evaluation metrics). The only minor inconsistency is that some of the papers mentioned in the literature review aren't explicitly referenced in the proposal, though their concepts are incorporated."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research goals are explicitly stated with four specific objectives. The methodology is detailed with subsections explaining each component of the approach, including mathematical formulations for the adapted SHAP and LIME methods. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are comprehensively described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact process for morphological segmentation could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the code-switch explanation classifier and the main model architecture could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'comprehensiveness and sufficiency metrics') are mentioned without full explanation. Overall, the proposal is highly understandable with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality in several aspects. The adaptation of SHAP and LIME to incorporate morphological features and code-switching patterns represents a novel technical contribution, particularly the hierarchical kernel for Morphological SHAP and the morphologically-aware distance metric for LIME. The community-driven co-design approach for explanation interfaces is innovative in the context of low-resource languages. The integration of technical robustness metrics with human-centered evaluation is also relatively uncommon in the field. While the core methods (SHAP, LIME, transformer architecture) are established, their adaptation and combination for low-resource language interpretability represents a fresh perspective. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on the intersection of interpretability, low-resource languages, and community engagement, rather than treating these as separate challenges."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The transformer architecture and training approach are well-justified and follow standard practices. The mathematical formulations for the adapted SHAP and LIME methods are correctly presented, with appropriate consideration of the computational challenges. The experimental design includes both technical and human-centered evaluations, with appropriate metrics for each. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the approximation error bounds for the hierarchical Shapley value computation need more detailed justification, (2) the proposal doesn't fully address how the morphological features will be obtained for languages with limited linguistic resources, (3) the statistical power analysis for the human evaluation studies is missing, and (4) there's limited discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach. Despite these gaps, the overall methodology is well-founded and the technical approach is reasonable."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately feasible but presents several implementation challenges. The scope is ambitious, covering three diverse languages with multiple technical innovations and community engagement components. The data collection strategy is reasonable, leveraging existing resources (OSCAR, CommonCrawl) and community contributions. The model architecture is deliberately lightweight (50M parameters) to accommodate resource constraints. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) annotating 5,000 sentences per language for morphological features and code-switch boundaries requires significant linguistic expertise and time, (2) organizing three co-design workshops per language community demands substantial coordination and resources, (3) the adaptation of SHAP to handle morphological features while maintaining computational efficiency is challenging, and (4) the timeline for completing all components (data collection, model training, method adaptation, interface design, and evaluation) is not specified but likely demanding. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively represent significant implementation hurdles that could affect the project's success."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the field of NLP: the lack of interpretable models for low-resource languages. This work has the potential for substantial impact in several ways: (1) it promotes equity in AI by extending advanced NLP capabilities to underserved linguistic communities, (2) it empowers these communities to audit and improve language models, fostering trust and adoption, (3) the open-source toolkit and annotated datasets will provide valuable resources for researchers and practitioners working with low-resource languages, (4) the design guidelines for culturally-aligned explanation interfaces could influence how AI systems are developed for diverse communities beyond the specific languages studied. The proposal explicitly connects to broader societal goals of fairness, transparency, and inclusivity in AI. The expected contributions are substantial and clearly articulated, with potential applications in education, health, and public services in underserved regions. The significance is further enhanced by the interdisciplinary approach combining technical innovation with community engagement."
