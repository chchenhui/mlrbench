        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the SoLaR workshop's focus on transparency, explainability, and applications for low-resource languages. The methodology incorporates key elements from the research idea, including adapting explanation techniques like SHAP and LIME for low-resource languages, co-designing interfaces with native speakers, and establishing dual evaluation metrics. The proposal effectively builds upon the literature, referencing InkubaLM and Glot500 datasets, GlotLID for language identification, and incorporating morphological adaptations and code-switching patterns as highlighted in the literature review. The three-phase approach (adaptive explanation techniques, community-driven interface design, and evaluation framework) comprehensively addresses the challenges identified in both the idea and literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with distinct sections outlining the background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research design is logically organized into three phases with specific tasks and approaches for each. Technical concepts are explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, such as the modified SHAP equation for morpheme-based explanations and the consistency metric for evaluation. The experimental setup clearly identifies the models, baselines, and target languages. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: the exact implementation details of the Code-Switching LIME approach could be more precisely defined, and the connection between the technical explanations and the community-designed interfaces could be more explicitly articulated. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant originality in several aspects. The adaptation of explainability methods (SHAP, LIME) to account for morphological boundaries and code-switching patterns represents a novel technical contribution, as these methods were originally designed for high-resource languages with different linguistic characteristics. The community-driven approach to designing culturally grounded explanation interfaces is particularly innovative, moving beyond purely technical solutions to incorporate social and cultural dimensions. The dual-focus evaluation framework that combines technical robustness with user-perceived trust metrics is also a fresh perspective. While the proposal builds upon existing explainability techniques and datasets (InkubaLM, Glot500), it extends them in new directions specifically tailored to low-resource language contexts. The integration of linguistic expertise, community participation, and technical innovation creates a novel interdisciplinary approach that distinguishes this work from prior research in the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The technical approach to modifying SHAP for morpheme-based explanations is well-formulated with appropriate mathematical notation. The evaluation framework includes both quantitative metrics (consistency scores, task success rates) and qualitative assessments (user surveys, think-aloud sessions). The selection of diverse languages covering different morphological typologies shows thoughtful experimental design. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: the statistical significance testing approach for comparing the adapted methods against baselines is not explicitly described; the sampling methodology for community participants in the interface design phase could be more detailed; and the proposal could benefit from a more thorough discussion of potential confounding variables in the user trust evaluations. While the overall approach is sound, these gaps in methodological detail prevent it from receiving a higher score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, it leverages existing datasets (Glot500, InkubaLM) and builds upon established explainability methods (SHAP, LIME), which provides a solid foundation. The three-phase approach allows for incremental progress and validation. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Coordinating participatory workshops across three diverse regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Indigenous South America) presents significant logistical challenges; (2) Annotating morphological boundaries and code-switching patterns for 10 target languages requires substantial linguistic expertise and time; (3) The proposal aims to cover five diverse languages (isiZulu, Quechua, Navajo, Bambara, and Sundanese), which may be ambitious given the depth of analysis required; (4) The development of culturally adapted interfaces for multiple linguistic communities demands considerable resources and expertise in cross-cultural design. While the research is technically implementable, these practical challenges suggest a need for either a more focused scope or a longer timeline to achieve all stated objectives."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in language model research with substantial potential impact. By focusing on transparency and interpretability for low-resource languages, it directly tackles issues of equity and inclusion in AI development. The significance is multi-faceted: (1) Technical contributions that extend explainability methods to previously underserved languages could influence future NLP research directions; (2) Community-driven interface design establishes a model for participatory AI development that centers marginalized users; (3) The dual-focus evaluation framework offers a template for assessing both technical performance and social impact; (4) The open-source toolkit and guidelines would provide practical resources for researchers and developers working with low-resource languages. The work has potential to reduce unchecked biases, foster equitable adoption of NLP technologies, and empower linguistic communities to audit and shape models that affect them. This aligns perfectly with the SoLaR workshop's emphasis on fairness, equity, accountability, and transparency in language modeling research."
