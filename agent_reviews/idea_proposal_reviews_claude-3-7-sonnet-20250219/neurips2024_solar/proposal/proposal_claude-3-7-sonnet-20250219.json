    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the SoLaR workshop's focus on transparency, explainability, and applications for low-resource languages. The proposal expands on the core idea of developing an interpretability framework for low-resource LMs by providing detailed methodologies for extending local explanation techniques, collaborating with native speakers, and establishing evaluation metrics. The literature review is thoroughly integrated throughout the proposal, with appropriate citations to works like InkubaLM (Tonja et al., 2024), Glot500 (Imani et al., 2023), and studies on morphological adaptations (Tanaka et al., 2024). The proposal maintains consistency in addressing the dual challenges of limited training data and lack of transparency mentioned in the research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. Research objectives are explicitly stated and the three-component methodology (adaptation of explanation techniques, community-centered interface design, and comprehensive evaluation) is well-defined. Technical approaches are explained with appropriate mathematical formulations, such as the hierarchical attribution system and cultural relevance scoring. The experimental protocol clearly outlines the languages to be studied and the evaluation process. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as more specific details on how the cultural knowledge bases will be constructed and maintained, and clearer connections between some of the mathematical formulations and their practical implementations."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining technical innovations with community participation in a way that hasn't been extensively explored for low-resource languages. The adaptation of explanation techniques to account for morphological complexity and code-switching is innovative, as is the hierarchical attribution system that can assign importance at multiple linguistic levels. The community-centered interface design approach is relatively fresh in the context of interpretability for low-resource languages. However, the core explanation methods being extended (SHAP, LIME) are established techniques, and some aspects of the community participation methodology draw from existing participatory design approaches. While the proposal offers a novel combination and application of these elements, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new interpretability paradigms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for hierarchical feature attribution, cross-lingual attribution alignment, and contextual relevance scoring are well-defined and theoretically sound. The evaluation framework is comprehensive, covering technical robustness, user-perceived trust, and community impact. The experimental protocol is well-designed, with a thoughtful selection of four diverse low-resource languages to validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges and addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, such as morphological complexity and code-switching. The integration of both quantitative metrics (faithfulness testing, consistency evaluation) and qualitative assessments (trust scale surveys, interviews) strengthens the methodological approach. However, some aspects could benefit from more detailed justification, such as the specific choice of baseline models and how the proposed methods will handle extremely limited data scenarios."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan, though with several significant challenges. The 18-month timeline with 3-4 months per language seems reasonable, but the scope of work is ambitious. Developing language-specific morphological processors and cultural reference databases for four diverse languages will require substantial resources and expertise. The community engagement component, while valuable, introduces logistical complexities in recruiting and maintaining relationships with 15-20 participants per language across multiple workshops. The technical adaptations to explanation methods are feasible given existing research, but implementing them for languages with limited computational resources may prove challenging. The proposal acknowledges some implementation challenges but could benefit from more contingency planning for potential obstacles, such as difficulties in participant recruitment or limitations in available language resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in language model research with substantial potential impact. By focusing on interpretability for low-resource languages, it tackles both technical challenges and social equity concerns in AI development. The work has direct implications for empowering marginalized linguistic communities, potentially affecting millions of speakers of low-resource languages who are currently underserved by language technologies. The open-source toolkit and evaluation benchmarks could become valuable resources for the research community, while the community-centered approach could establish new standards for responsible AI development. The proposal explicitly connects to broader goals of fairness, transparency, and inclusivity in global NLP applications, aligning with growing concerns about AI ethics and responsible innovation. The potential to shift power dynamics in technology development toward greater inclusivity represents a significant contribution to socially responsible AI research."
