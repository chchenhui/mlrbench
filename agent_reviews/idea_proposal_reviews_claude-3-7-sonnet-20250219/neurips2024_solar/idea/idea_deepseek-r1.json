        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the SoLaR workshop's focus on socially responsible language modeling. It directly addresses two key topics mentioned in the task description: 'Transparency, explainability, interpretability of LMs' and 'Applications of LMs for low-resource languages.' The proposal emphasizes fairness, equity, and transparency—core values highlighted in the workshop description. It also considers the societal impacts of deployment and aims to reduce bias risks, which are additional topics of interest for the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other workshop topics like security concerns or robustness, though it does touch on evaluation metrics for technical robustness."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The proposal defines a three-part approach: extending local explanation techniques, collaborating with native speakers, and establishing evaluation metrics. The technical components (SHAP, LIME) are specified, and the community-driven aspects are explained. However, there are some minor ambiguities—for example, the specific low-resource languages to be targeted aren't identified, and the exact implementation details of how SHAP/LIME would be adapted for unique linguistic features could be more precisely defined. The proposal could also benefit from more concrete examples of what the 'intuitive explanation interfaces' might look like."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining technical interpretability methods with community-driven validation specifically for low-resource languages—an intersection that hasn't been extensively explored. The adaptation of explanation techniques (SHAP, LIME) to accommodate unique linguistic features of low-resource languages is innovative. The community co-design approach for explanation interfaces aligned with cultural norms is also a fresh perspective. However, the core technical methods mentioned (SHAP, LIME) are established techniques, and the proposal builds upon rather than fundamentally reimagines interpretability approaches. The novelty lies more in the application context and community integration than in proposing entirely new technical methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Extending local explanation techniques to low-resource languages is technically viable, though it may require significant adaptation work. The community collaboration aspect, while valuable, introduces logistical complexities in recruiting and engaging native speakers from potentially diverse linguistic communities. Developing culturally appropriate interfaces requires deep understanding of multiple cultural contexts, which may be resource-intensive. The evaluation framework combining technical and user-perceived metrics is reasonable but would require careful design. The proposal doesn't address potential computational constraints when working with low-resource languages or how to handle the variability across different low-resource language families, which could complicate implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in AI ethics and inclusivity. Low-resource languages are systematically underrepresented in NLP research, and adding interpretability to these models could have substantial impact for marginalized linguistic communities. The work could help prevent the perpetuation of biases and exclusion that the task description explicitly mentions as concerns. By empowering communities to audit and refine models, the research promotes equity in AI access and benefits. The open-source tools and guidelines proposed as outcomes could influence broader NLP practices beyond the specific languages studied. This work sits at the intersection of technical advancement and social justice in AI, directly addressing the workshop's core mission of promoting responsible language modeling research that considers societal impacts."
