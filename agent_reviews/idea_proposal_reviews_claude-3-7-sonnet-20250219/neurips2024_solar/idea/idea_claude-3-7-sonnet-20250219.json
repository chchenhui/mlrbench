        "justification": "The Transparency Ledger idea aligns excellently with the SoLaR workshop's focus on socially responsible language modeling research. It directly addresses the workshop's emphasis on transparency, accountability, and ethical considerations in LM development. The proposal specifically targets the 'Transparency, explainability, interpretability of LMs' topic listed in the workshop description. It also touches on auditing and evaluation of LMs, as well as deployment protocols, which are other key topics mentioned. The idea recognizes the risks and harms associated with LMs and proposes a concrete mechanism to address them through increased transparency, which is central to the workshop's mission."

        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (lack of transparency in LLM development) and proposes a specific solution (a distributed ledger system for documenting the LLM lifecycle). The proposal outlines key components that would be included in the ledger (data sources, preprocessing methods, architectural decisions, etc.) and explains how the system would work (using cryptographic verification while maintaining appropriate access controls). However, some technical details about the implementation of the cryptographic verification mechanisms and how exactly the ledger would balance transparency with proprietary information protection could be further elaborated. The concept of a 'distributed ledger' is mentioned but not fully explained in terms of its technical architecture."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines established concepts (distributed ledgers, transparency documentation) in a novel application specific to LLM development. While transparency documentation and model cards exist in the AI field, the proposal's innovation lies in creating a comprehensive, tamper-resistant system that spans the entire lifecycle of an LLM. The use of cryptographic verification for ensuring the integrity of claims about models while protecting proprietary information represents a fresh approach to balancing commercial and ethical interests. However, the core technologies (distributed ledgers, cryptographic verification) are not themselves new, and similar transparency frameworks have been proposed in adjacent fields. The idea builds upon existing work in AI documentation rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal faces several implementation challenges. Creating a comprehensive ledger system that documents every aspect of LLM development while maintaining security and appropriate access controls is technically complex. Major questions remain about how to incentivize adoption, especially from commercial entities that may be reluctant to share details about their models. Technical challenges include: how to verify claims without exposing proprietary information, how to standardize documentation across diverse development pipelines, and how to ensure the ledger itself is secure and tamper-proof. While distributed ledger technologies exist, adapting them to the specific needs of LLM transparency would require significant engineering effort. The proposal is implementable but would require substantial resources, industry cooperation, and technical refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in the current AI ecosystem. As LLMs become increasingly integrated into high-stakes applications and decision-making processes, the lack of transparency represents a significant ethical and practical concern. The proposed Transparency Ledger could substantially improve accountability, enable meaningful auditing, and help rebuild public trust in AI systems. It could become a foundational infrastructure for responsible AI development, potentially influencing industry standards and regulatory frameworks. The impact would extend beyond technical improvements to affect policy, governance, and public perception of AI. By creating verifiable records of model development, the system could help prevent misrepresentation of AI capabilities and limitations, addressing a key concern in the field. The significance is particularly high given the growing societal impact of language models."
