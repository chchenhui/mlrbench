    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task of bridging the gap between RL theorists and experimentalists. The proposed multi-model framework directly addresses the disconnect mentioned in the task description between theoretical algorithms designed for simplified settings and the challenges of real-world applications. The framework's three components (theoretical, practical, and hybrid models) specifically target the communication between existing results and methodologies from both communities. However, while the idea addresses the general goal of bridging the gap, it could more explicitly address the second desideratum of identifying new problem classes of practical interest, which is mentioned in the task but not clearly incorporated in the research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure that outlines the motivation, main idea, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-component framework is defined in a straightforward manner, making the overall concept easy to understand. However, there are some ambiguities that prevent it from receiving a higher score. For instance, the exact mechanisms for knowledge exchange between the theoretical and practical models are not fully specified. Additionally, the 'hybrid model' concept needs more elaboration on how it will concretely combine insights from the other two models. The proposal would benefit from more specific examples of how the framework would operate in practice and clearer metrics for evaluating its success."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea of creating a framework to bridge theory and practice in RL has moderate novelty. While the specific three-component structure (theoretical, practical, and hybrid models) provides a fresh organizational approach, the core concept of connecting theory and practice is not groundbreaking in the field of machine learning. Many research groups and conferences already aim to bridge this gap, though perhaps less systematically. The proposal doesn't clearly articulate how this framework differs from existing collaborative approaches in the field. To be more novel, the idea would need to introduce more innovative mechanisms for knowledge transfer or specific technical innovations in how theoretical insights are translated into practical algorithms."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed framework is reasonably feasible as it builds upon existing research practices rather than requiring entirely new methodologies or technologies. The three-component approach could be implemented by research teams with expertise in both theoretical and applied RL. However, there are implementation challenges that aren't fully addressed. For instance, creating effective communication channels between theorists and experimentalists requires overcoming different research priorities, vocabularies, and incentive structures. The proposal would benefit from more concrete details on how to implement the hybrid model and how to measure its effectiveness. Additionally, the resources required (computational, human expertise, time) for maintaining parallel theoretical and practical models could be substantial."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is high as it addresses a fundamental challenge in the field of reinforcement learning. Successfully bridging the gap between theory and practice could accelerate progress in RL applications across numerous domains. The potential impact includes more robust algorithms that maintain theoretical guarantees while being practical for real-world scenarios, which could lead to significant advancements in areas like robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems. The framework could also foster a more cohesive RL research community by creating structured collaboration between theorists and experimentalists. The significance is particularly high given the explicit need identified in the task description for better alignment between these two communities."
