    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap between RL theory and practice by systematically analyzing empirical heuristics that work in practice but lack theoretical justification. The methodology follows the research idea of reverse-engineering heuristics, formalizing their implicit assumptions, and developing hybrid algorithms. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, referencing works like Laidlaw et al. (2023) on effective horizon, Wu (2024) on LLM-guided Q-learning, and various papers on heuristic analysis. The four-phase approach (selection, theoretical analysis, principled component design, and experimental validation) is comprehensive and well-structured to achieve the stated objectives. The proposal also explicitly addresses the workshop's desiderata of communicating existing results and identifying new problem classes of practical interest."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from background to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined with five specific goals. The methodology is detailed across four phases with concrete examples of heuristics to analyze (reward shaping, exploration bonuses, experience replay modifications). The theoretical analysis section provides mathematical formalism and specific examples of how heuristics will be analyzed. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying environments, comparison algorithms, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the specific criteria for selecting which heuristics to prioritize among the many candidates, (2) more details on how the principled components will be integrated into existing algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency, and (3) clearer explanation of how the theoretical guarantees will be validated empirically."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to bridging RL theory and practice by systematically reverse-engineering successful heuristics rather than developing new algorithms from scratch. This perspective shift—starting from empirical success and working backward to theory—is innovative and addresses a significant gap in the field. The idea of creating hybrid algorithms that replace heuristic components with theoretically grounded alternatives while maintaining the overall algorithm structure is particularly original. The proposal also introduces a comprehensive framework for analyzing heuristics across multiple dimensions (implicit assumptions, problem structures, theoretical guarantees). While some individual elements have been explored in prior work (as noted in the literature review), the systematic, unified approach to multiple heuristics and the development of a general methodology for translating heuristics into principled components represents a significant advancement beyond existing research."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and a rigorous approach to analyzing RL heuristics. The mathematical formalism is appropriate, with clear notation for MDPs and modifications introduced by heuristics. The proposed analyses (sample complexity bounds, regret analysis, bias-variance analysis, convergence analysis) are well-established theoretical tools in RL. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address the challenge of analyzing heuristics in the context of deep RL with complex function approximators, where theoretical guarantees are notoriously difficult to establish. (2) The connection between the empirical performance of hybrid algorithms and the theoretical guarantees could be more explicitly formalized. (3) Some of the proposed analyses (e.g., linking heuristic effectiveness to MDP properties) may be challenging to achieve in practice, especially for complex heuristics. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is methodologically sound and builds appropriately on existing theoretical frameworks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines an ambitious research agenda that faces several feasibility challenges. While the overall approach is logical, the scope may be too broad for a single research project. Analyzing multiple heuristics (reward shaping, exploration bonuses, experience replay modifications, regularization techniques) in depth, each requiring formal mathematical analysis, development of principled alternatives, and extensive empirical validation, represents a substantial workload. The theoretical analysis of heuristics in the context of function approximation (especially deep neural networks) is particularly challenging and may not yield clean theoretical results. The experimental validation across diverse environments (from simple control tasks to Atari games) is comprehensive but resource-intensive. The proposal would benefit from a more focused approach, perhaps prioritizing 1-2 heuristics for in-depth analysis rather than attempting to cover many. Additionally, while the methodology is well-described, it doesn't fully address potential obstacles such as the difficulty of formalizing certain heuristics or the computational resources required for extensive experimentation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning—the disconnect between theoretical understanding and empirical success. This work has the potential for high impact across several dimensions: (1) Scientific advancement: By formalizing the implicit assumptions of heuristics, it could reveal new theoretical insights about what makes RL algorithms work in practice. (2) Practical applications: The hybrid algorithms could lead to more robust, generalizable, and trustworthy RL systems for real-world applications. (3) Community bridge-building: The research directly addresses the workshop's goal of bringing theorists and experimentalists together, creating a common language and understanding. (4) Future research direction: The methodology provides a template for analyzing other heuristics and could inspire a new approach to algorithm development that combines theoretical rigor with empirical effectiveness. The significance is further enhanced by the growing importance of RL in various domains and the increasing need for reliable, well-understood algorithms for critical applications."
