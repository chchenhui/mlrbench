        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the gap between RL theory and practice identified in the task description by systematically analyzing empirical heuristics and providing theoretical foundations. The proposal follows through on the research idea of 'reverse-engineering empirical successes' by formalizing heuristics, deriving theoretical guarantees, and designing hybrid algorithms. It incorporates key elements from the literature review, including reward shaping analysis, exploration bonuses, and LLM-based heuristics. The methodology specifically addresses challenges identified in the literature review such as lack of theoretical justification, sample efficiency, and bias introduction. The only minor inconsistency is that some of the theoretical results presented (Theorems 2.1 and 2.2) are quite specific and might not cover the full breadth of heuristics mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a clear roadmap with four distinct stages: heuristic formalization, theoretical analysis, hybrid algorithm design, and experimental validation. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, with appropriate notation. The three proposed hybrid algorithms (RSL, HA-UCRL, and PFQI) are described with sufficient detail, including pseudocode or algorithmic steps. The experimental design section outlines datasets, baselines, metrics, and validation protocols comprehensively. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the connection between the theoretical results and the hybrid algorithms could be more explicitly stated, (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'Bellman rank', 'concentrability') are used without definition, and (3) the expected outcomes section could provide more specific quantitative predictions about theoretical guarantees."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to bridging theory and practice in RL. The idea of reverse-engineering empirical heuristics to provide theoretical foundations is innovative and addresses a significant gap in the field. The three hybrid algorithms (RSL, HA-UCRL, and PFQI) represent novel combinations of theoretical principles and practical heuristics. The formalization of LLM-based heuristics as prior value estimations is particularly forward-looking. However, some individual components build incrementally on existing work: potential-based reward shaping has been studied before (Ng et al., 1999), and the exploration bonus analysis extends UCBVI (Azar et al., 2017). The theoretical analysis of non-potential reward shaping (Theorem 2.1) appears to be a novel contribution, but the overall approach of combining theoretical guarantees with empirical heuristics has precedents in the literature review (e.g., papers 5-10). While the proposal offers fresh perspectives and new combinations, it is not entirely groundbreaking in its fundamental concepts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for reward shaping, exploration bonuses, and LLM heuristics are correctly presented and consistent with established RL theory. The theoretical results (Theorems 2.1 and 2.2) are well-formulated with appropriate complexity measures and error terms. The methodology follows a logical progression from formalization to analysis to algorithm design to experimental validation. The proposed algorithms incorporate theoretical insights in a principled manner. The experimental design includes appropriate controls, baselines, and statistical validation. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the assumptions underlying the theoretical results could be more explicitly stated and justified, (2) the analysis of LLM and planning heuristics is less developed than the other sections, with fewer formal guarantees, and (3) the sample complexity bound for LLM priors lacks a detailed derivation. Overall, the proposal is technically sound with minor gaps in the theoretical development."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable scope. The four-stage methodology provides a structured approach to addressing the research objectives. The proposed algorithms (RSL, HA-UCRL, PFQI) are implementable with current techniques and resources. The experimental design uses established benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo, classical planning) and metrics. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) the theoretical analysis of complex heuristics, especially those derived from LLMs, may be more difficult than anticipated, (2) the computational resources required for comprehensive experiments across multiple environments and algorithms are substantial, (3) the integration of theoretical guarantees with deep RL methods involves bridging function approximation theory with practical implementations, which is non-trivial, and (4) the proposal aims to address a wide range of heuristics, which may be ambitious for a single research project. While these challenges are manageable, they do introduce some risk and may require prioritization or scope adjustment during execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in reinforcement learning research - the disconnect between theoretical foundations and empirical successes. This work has the potential for high impact across multiple dimensions: (1) Scientific advancement: It provides a formal understanding of why empirical heuristics work, potentially leading to new theoretical insights about RL problem structures. (2) Practical applications: The hybrid algorithms could improve sample efficiency and robustness in real-world RL applications. (3) Community building: By explicitly bridging experimentalist and theorist perspectives, it addresses the workshop's goal of aligning these communities. (4) Future research: The theoretical frameworks and hybrid algorithms could inspire new research directions that maintain this theory-practice connection. The expected outcomes include concrete deliverables (algorithms, code, pretrained models) and quantifiable improvements (20-50% reduction in sample complexity). The proposal also addresses important challenges in RL deployment, such as reliability, interpretability, and generalization. The significance is further enhanced by the growing importance of RL in real-world applications and the need for more trustworthy and efficient algorithms."
