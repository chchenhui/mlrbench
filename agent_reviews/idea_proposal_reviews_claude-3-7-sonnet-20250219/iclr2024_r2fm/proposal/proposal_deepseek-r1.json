    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of spurious features in foundation models, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as a key concern for reliable and responsible FMs. The two-stage pipeline (causal attribution via interventions followed by pruning) faithfully implements the core concept outlined in the research idea. The methodology builds upon existing literature, particularly drawing from CCR's causal feature selection and SEraser's approach to spurious feature mitigation, while extending these concepts to foundation models. The proposal covers multiple evaluation domains (QA, sentiment analysis, bias detection) that align with the task's focus on reliability and responsibility across diverse applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained with appropriate mathematical formulations that define the spuriousness score and loss functions. The two-stage pipeline is logically presented with distinct steps. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for generating counterfactual inputs X' could be more explicitly defined, (2) the relationship between the contrastive loss and the penalized reweighting could be better explained in terms of how they complement each other, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'do-calculations') are introduced without full explanation. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and follows a logical flow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining causal intervention techniques with feature pruning specifically for foundation models. While individual components draw from existing work (e.g., CCR's causal feature selection and SEraser's spurious feature mitigation), the integration of these approaches into a comprehensive framework for FMs represents a novel contribution. The three types of interventions (masking, scaling, swapping) provide a more nuanced approach than typical ablation studies. However, the core techniques of causal attribution and contrastive learning are established methods, and the proposal primarily adapts them to the FM context rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The novelty lies more in the application domain and integration of methods rather than in developing entirely new technical approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor with well-defined mathematical formulations and a methodical approach to causal attribution and feature pruning. The spuriousness score based on KL divergence is theoretically sound for measuring causal effects, and the contrastive learning framework is well-established. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical analysis procedures. The connection to causal inference principles is well-justified. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) the assumption that individual feature interventions can isolate causal effects may not hold in highly entangled representations typical of FMs, (2) the threshold Ï„ for determining spurious features seems somewhat arbitrary without a principled way to set it, and (3) the proposal could benefit from more discussion of potential confounding factors in the intervention process. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal faces significant feasibility challenges when applied to large foundation models. The intervention-based approach requires manipulating individual hidden activations and computing KL divergence across many samples, which would be computationally intensive for models with billions of parameters. The contrastive training stage would similarly require substantial computational resources. The proposal does not adequately address how to scale these methods to modern FMs like GPT-4 or LLaMA-3. Additionally, generating meaningful counterfactuals for complex inputs is non-trivial and may require domain expertise. The evaluation on three distinct domains (QA, sentiment analysis, bias detection) is ambitious and would require significant data preparation and model fine-tuning. While the core methods are implementable with current technology, scaling them efficiently to state-of-the-art FMs presents substantial challenges that are not fully addressed in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in foundation models: their reliance on spurious correlations that lead to hallucinations, bias, and poor generalization. Successfully mitigating these issues would have far-reaching implications for the reliability and responsibility of AI systems. The expected outcomes (15-20% reduction in hallucinations, 10-25% improvement in OOD generalization, 30% reduction in bias) would represent meaningful advances in model trustworthiness. The domain-agnostic nature of the approach increases its potential impact across various applications. The work bridges the gap between causal inference and large-scale models, potentially establishing a new paradigm for model development. The significance is somewhat tempered by feasibility concerns and the incremental nature of the technical innovations, but the potential impact on addressing a fundamental challenge in responsible AI is substantial."
