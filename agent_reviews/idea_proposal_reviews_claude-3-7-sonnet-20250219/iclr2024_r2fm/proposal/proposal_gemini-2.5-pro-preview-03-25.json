        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the R2-FM workshop's focus on reliable and responsible foundation models by targeting spurious correlations that lead to hallucinations, biases, and poor generalization. The proposed Intervention-Based Causal Pruning (ICP) framework faithfully expands on the initial idea of a two-stage pipeline for causal attribution and intervention-guided pruning. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing and building upon works like Zhou & Zhu (2024), Ma et al. (2024), and Wang et al. (2021) while addressing the identified key challenges of identifying spurious features, designing effective interventions, and scaling causal methods to foundation models. The research objectives clearly align with the workshop's fundamental questions about identifying unreliable behaviors, understanding their causes, and developing interventions to improve reliability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with formal mathematical notation for the causal attribution process and intervention techniques. The two-stage framework (causal attribution followed by pruning/fine-tuning) is logically presented with specific implementation details. The experimental design includes well-defined baselines, evaluation tasks, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact procedure for scaling the approach to very large foundation models could be more explicitly addressed, as the intervention process requires multiple forward passes; (2) the relationship between the spuriousness score and specific types of model failures could be more precisely defined; and (3) some technical details about the implementation of interventions in complex architectures like transformer attention mechanisms could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in its approach to mitigating spurious correlations in foundation models. The key novel aspects include: (1) applying causal intervention techniques directly to internal model representations rather than just inputs or outputs; (2) developing a quantitative spuriousness score based on systematic interventions across diverse inputs; and (3) combining pruning with causal invariance regularization during fine-tuning. While the individual components (causal interventions, feature pruning, invariance regularization) have precedents in the literature, their integration into a comprehensive framework specifically targeting foundation models' internal representations is innovative. However, the approach shares conceptual similarities with existing work on counterfactual reasoning (Zhou & Zhu, 2024) and test-time adaptation (Ma et al., 2024), and the basic idea of identifying and mitigating spurious correlations has been explored in various forms. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches, which is why it scores well but not at the highest level of novelty."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with a well-grounded theoretical foundation in causal inference. The mathematical formulation of interventions (do-calculus) and spuriousness scoring is rigorous and follows established principles. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics that directly measure the targeted improvements in reliability, fairness, and calibration. The two-stage approach is logical, with clear connections between the identification of spurious features and their subsequent mitigation. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations and includes ablation studies to test key assumptions. The methodology builds appropriately on prior work in causal ML and foundation model reliability. One minor concern is that the causal assumptions underlying the intervention approach (particularly the assumption that individual features can be manipulated independently without affecting the causal structure) could be more thoroughly justified. Additionally, while the proposal discusses computational efficiency considerations, a more detailed analysis of the computational feasibility for very large models would strengthen the technical soundness."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a somewhat feasible approach but faces significant implementation challenges. On the positive side, the research uses existing foundation models and publicly available datasets, and the basic intervention techniques (masking, scaling) are implementable with current deep learning frameworks. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are realistic. However, several practical challenges raise concerns: (1) Computational cost: The intervention process requires multiple forward passes for each feature and input combination, which could be prohibitively expensive for large foundation models with billions of parameters. While the proposal mentions focusing on specific layers or high-variance features, the scalability remains questionable. (2) Feature granularity: Identifying which specific neurons or attention components to intervene on in massive models is non-trivial. (3) Causal attribution accuracy: The accuracy of attributing spuriousness to specific features depends on the quality and diversity of the probing dataset, which may be difficult to construct comprehensively. (4) Fine-tuning stability: The proposed causal invariance regularization might lead to optimization challenges or unexpected side effects on model performance. These feasibility concerns don't make the research impossible but suggest significant engineering challenges that aren't fully addressed in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI reliability and responsibility with potentially high impact. Spurious correlations in foundation models directly contribute to hallucinations, biases, and poor generalization - issues that limit the trustworthiness and safe deployment of these models in high-stakes applications. The expected outcomes include both methodological contributions (the ICP framework) and empirical improvements (reduced hallucination rates, better OOD generalization, lower bias). If successful, this research could significantly advance our understanding of how spurious correlations manifest within foundation models and provide practical tools for mitigating them. The work directly addresses multiple questions posed by the R2-FM workshop, particularly around identifying unreliable behaviors, understanding their causes, and developing interventions. The potential applications span critical domains like factual QA, bias mitigation, and robust classification. The proposal also contributes to the broader goal of developing more transparent and interpretable AI by providing insights into the causal role of internal features. While the approach may not completely solve all reliability issues in foundation models, it represents a significant step toward more trustworthy AI systems."
