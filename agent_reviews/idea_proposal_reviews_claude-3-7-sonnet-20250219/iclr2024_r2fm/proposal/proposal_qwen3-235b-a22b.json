        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the R²-FM workshop's focus on reliable and responsible foundation models by targeting spurious correlations that lead to hallucinations, bias, and poor generalization. The two-stage pipeline (causal attribution via interventions followed by pruning/reweighting) faithfully implements the core idea presented in the research idea section. The proposal also builds upon and acknowledges the literature review, specifically referencing CCR and SEraser approaches while positioning its contribution as a more mechanistic and generalizable approach. The experimental validation plan covers multiple modalities and includes metrics directly relevant to the workshop's concerns about reliability and responsibility."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is presented with appropriate mathematical formalism that enhances precision without sacrificing readability. The two-stage pipeline is logically organized with detailed explanations of each component. The experimental validation section clearly outlines datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for contrastive invariant learning could be more thoroughly explained, particularly how positive and negative pairs are constructed in practice; (2) some technical terms (e.g., 'topological clusters') are introduced without full explanation; and (3) the relationship between the pruning approach and existing mechanistic interpretability methods could be more explicitly defined."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in its approach to addressing spurious correlations in foundation models. The combination of causal attribution through targeted interventions with subsequent pruning and reweighting represents a fresh perspective compared to existing methods. The introduction of Spurious Sensitivity Score (SSS) and Invariance Disruption Score (IDS) as quantitative metrics for spuriousness is innovative. However, the core techniques build upon existing work in causal inference, counterfactual interventions, and model pruning rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms. The proposal acknowledges its relationship to prior work like CCR and SEraser while highlighting its unique contributions in applying mechanistic interpretability at scale. The approach is more evolutionary than revolutionary, offering meaningful improvements and novel combinations rather than groundbreaking new concepts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The causal framework is well-grounded in established principles of intervention-based causal inference, and the mathematical formulations for quantifying spurious features are technically sound. The two-stage pipeline follows a logical progression from identification to mitigation. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, diverse datasets across modalities, and relevant evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to assess the impact of different pruning rates. However, there are some areas where additional theoretical justification would strengthen the approach: (1) the theoretical guarantees that pruning identified spurious features will preserve model functionality are not fully established; (2) the relationship between the proposed metrics (SSS and IDS) and actual spuriousness could be more rigorously justified; and (3) the potential interactions between pruned features and the overall model architecture could be more thoroughly analyzed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation plans. The use of established foundation models (LLaMA-300M and CLIP ViT-B/32) as base architectures is practical, and the intervention techniques described are implementable with current technology. The experimental validation plan is comprehensive and achievable. However, several challenges may affect feasibility: (1) the computational cost of performing interventions across numerous features in large models could be substantial, potentially requiring significant resources; (2) the contrastive learning approach may require careful tuning to avoid degrading model performance; (3) generating appropriate counterfactual pairs for diverse tasks and domains could be labor-intensive; and (4) the proposed 25% reduction in hallucination and 15-20% improvement in domain shift robustness are ambitious targets that may be difficult to achieve consistently across all benchmarks. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they do suggest that the full implementation may require more resources and refinement than indicated."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in foundation models—their reliance on spurious correlations—that directly impacts reliability, fairness, and safety. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy addresses a major concern in large language models; (2) enhancing domain robustness would improve real-world applicability; (3) the transparency tools and interpretable feature dashboards would advance responsible AI development; and (4) the theoretical contributions could deepen our understanding of causal mechanisms in large-scale systems. The proposal also highlights concrete applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare and pharmaceutical research, where reliability is paramount. The expected outcomes include both technical advancements (improved metrics) and broader societal impacts (certified deployment pipelines, compliance with regulations). While the significance is high, the proposal could more explicitly quantify the potential real-world impact beyond the technical improvements, particularly regarding how these enhancements would translate to tangible benefits for end-users and affected communities."
