    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop topic of 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' by developing SecureED, a framework for detecting AI-generated content in educational assessments. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the contrastive learning approach, multimodal dataset integration, and adversarial training. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing limitations in current detection tools (like GPTZero) and incorporating methodologies from papers like ConDA and DeTeCtive. The proposal acknowledges challenges identified in the literature review such as cross-domain generalizability, adversarial evasion tactics, and the need for explainability. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions watermarking techniques, the proposal doesn't fully explore this as a complementary approach."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail, including the contrastive learning framework, data collection strategy, and evaluation metrics. The mathematical formulation of the contrastive loss function adds technical precision. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The exact implementation details of the domain adversarial network could be more thoroughly explained, (2) The figure referenced (Figure 1) is mentioned but not provided in the excerpt, and (3) The explanation of how the SHAP values will be integrated for explainability could be more detailed. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is logically structured and comprehensible to readers familiar with machine learning concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements. The application of contrastive learning specifically for educational assessment contexts is relatively new, and the integration of domain-specific features (reasoning coherence, creativity patterns, error distributions) tailored to educational contexts is innovative. The proposal also introduces a novel triplet network architecture with domain adversarial components to enhance cross-domain generalizability. However, the core detection approach builds heavily on existing contrastive learning methods like ConDA and DeTeCtive mentioned in the literature review. While the proposal adapts these methods to the educational domain and enhances them with domain-specific features, the fundamental technical approach is an extension rather than a completely new paradigm. The adversarial training component also follows established GAN-style approaches. The proposal's novelty lies more in its application domain and specific implementation details rather than in proposing entirely new detection methodologies."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The contrastive learning approach is appropriate for the detection task and is supported by recent literature (ConDA, DeTeCtive). The triplet network architecture and loss function are mathematically well-formulated. The adversarial training strategy to enhance robustness against evasion tactics is technically sound and addresses a key challenge in detection systems. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including appropriate baselines, metrics, and validation approaches. The domain-specific feature engineering is well-justified for the educational context. However, there are some areas that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) The proposal could more explicitly address potential limitations of contrastive learning in this context, (2) The expected performance improvements (≥90% F1-score) could be better justified based on theoretical or preliminary results, and (3) The domain adversarial component could be more thoroughly grounded in transfer learning theory. Despite these minor gaps, the overall approach is technically rigorous and well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The data collection strategy leverages existing datasets (CodeComment, MATH dataset, CyberHumanAI) and proposes generating additional data using available LFMs, which is practical. The model architecture builds on established transformer models and contrastive learning techniques that have been successfully implemented in similar contexts. However, there are several feasibility challenges: (1) Creating a truly representative dataset across diverse educational domains (STEM, humanities) with paired human/AI responses may be more resource-intensive than anticipated, (2) The adversarial training component requires sophisticated generation of perturbed samples that convincingly evade detection, which is technically challenging, (3) Achieving the ambitious performance targets (≥90% F1-score, <5% performance drop under attacks) may be difficult given the current state of the art, and (4) The human evaluation component requiring 50 educators to rate explanations adds logistical complexity. While these challenges don't render the project infeasible, they do present significant implementation hurdles that may require additional resources or timeline adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and timely problem in educational assessment with far-reaching implications. As AI tools become increasingly accessible to students, maintaining assessment integrity is a pressing concern for educational institutions worldwide. The significance of this work is substantial in several dimensions: (1) Educational impact: By providing reliable detection tools, the research directly contributes to preserving academic integrity in high-stakes assessments, (2) Technical contributions: The proposed advances in contrastive learning for cross-domain generalization could benefit the broader field of AI-generated content detection, (3) Practical application: The planned open-source API and integration guidelines for assessment platforms would enable widespread adoption, and (4) Policy implications: The work could inform institutional and regulatory approaches to AI use in education. The proposal also addresses key limitations in current detection systems (poor generalizability, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, limited explainability) that currently hinder adoption. The potential to establish standards for AI accountability in education further enhances its significance. The proposal convincingly articulates these impacts and their importance to multiple stakeholders in the educational ecosystem."
