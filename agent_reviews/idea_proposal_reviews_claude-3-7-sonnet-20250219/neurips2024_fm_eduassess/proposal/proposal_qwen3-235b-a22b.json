    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The SecureED proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' by developing a framework to detect AI-generated responses in educational assessments. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the contrastive learning approach, multimodal dataset (text, code, math), adversarial training, and cross-domain generalizability. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing limitations in current detection tools (GPTZero, Copyleaks) and incorporating methodologies from papers like ConDA and DeTeCtive. The proposal acknowledges challenges identified in the literature, such as detection accuracy, generalizability, and adversarial evasion tactics. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions the CyberHumanAI dataset, the proposal could have more explicitly detailed how it would leverage or improve upon this existing resource."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is well-defined, including the contrastive learning framework, triplet loss function, and domain-adversarial training. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are thoroughly explained. The proposal effectively communicates complex concepts like contrastive learning and adversarial training in an accessible manner. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact implementation details of the domain-adversarial training with gradient reversal layer could be more thoroughly explained; (2) The proposal mentions 'burstiness' and 'logical coherence' as explainable features but doesn't fully define how these would be quantified; (3) While the proposal mentions partnerships with educational platforms, it doesn't detail the specific arrangements or data-sharing agreements that would be necessary. Despite these minor issues, the overall clarity is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing approaches in a novel way specifically tailored for educational assessment. The integration of contrastive learning with domain-adversarial training for cross-domain generalization in educational contexts is innovative. The multimodal approach spanning text, code, and math responses is a fresh perspective not commonly addressed in existing detection systems. The proposal's focus on higher-order reasoning tasks (coding challenges, mathematical proofs, essays) also differentiates it from generic text detection tools. However, the core technical components—contrastive learning, triplet loss, domain adaptation—are adaptations of existing techniques rather than fundamentally new methods. The proposal builds upon frameworks like ConDA and DeTeCtive rather than introducing entirely new detection paradigms. While the application to educational assessment and the specific combination of techniques is novel, the underlying methodological approach shares similarities with existing work in the literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-established theoretical foundations. The contrastive learning approach with triplet loss is mathematically well-formulated and appropriate for the task of distinguishing between human and AI-generated content. The domain-adversarial training with gradient reversal layer is a proven technique for improving cross-domain generalization. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including appropriate metrics (Accuracy, F1-Score, AUC-ROC) and baselines for comparison. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and includes mitigation strategies. The adversarial training approach to counter evasion tactics is technically sound and well-justified. The only minor weaknesses in soundness are: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address how the model would handle mixed responses (partially AI-generated, partially human); (2) While the triplet loss function is presented, there's limited discussion of potential alternatives or why this specific formulation was chosen; (3) The proposal could benefit from more detailed statistical power analysis to justify the dataset size and sampling strategy. Overall, the technical approach is rigorous and well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components, though it does face some implementation challenges. The technical approach relies on established methods (transformer models, contrastive learning) that have been successfully implemented in similar contexts. The data collection strategy is practical, leveraging existing datasets and partnerships with educational platforms. The evaluation methodology is well-defined and implementable. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Creating a multimodal dataset of 500,000+ labeled responses across diverse domains is ambitious and resource-intensive; (2) Partnerships with educational platforms like Coursera and edX may be difficult to establish due to privacy concerns and commercial interests; (3) The real-time detection integration with LMS platforms would require significant engineering effort beyond the research components; (4) Ensuring robust performance across diverse educational domains (STEM, humanities) and response types (text, code, math) simultaneously is challenging. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that would require careful planning and resource allocation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and timely problem in educational assessment with far-reaching implications. As large foundation models become increasingly accessible to students, maintaining assessment integrity is a pressing concern for educational institutions worldwide. The potential impact of SecureED is substantial: (1) It would help preserve the validity and fairness of educational assessments in the AI era; (2) It would enable educators to adopt AI for legitimate educational purposes while mitigating misuse; (3) The open-source API and guidelines would provide practical tools for immediate implementation; (4) The multimodal dataset would be a valuable resource for future research in this area. The proposal also has broader implications for AI accountability and ethics in education. By developing explainable detection methods, it contributes to the responsible integration of AI in educational settings. The significance extends beyond academia to policy development and industry practices. The proposal directly addresses a gap identified in the literature review and workshop description, making it highly relevant to current educational challenges."
