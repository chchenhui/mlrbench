    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' by developing a contrastive learning framework (SecureED) to detect AI-generated responses in educational assessments. The proposal incorporates key elements from the research idea, including the contrastive learning approach, multimodal dataset spanning text/code/math, and focus on high-order thinking tasks. The literature review is thoroughly integrated, with explicit references to ConDA (Bhattacharjee et al., 2023), DeTeCtive (Guo et al., 2024), WhosAI (La Cava et al., 2024), and watermarking techniques (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023). The proposal also addresses the challenges identified in the literature review regarding detection accuracy, generalizability, adversarial evasion, and explainability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The methodology section provides a comprehensive explanation of the data collection, model architecture, contrastive learning framework, and evaluation procedures. The proposal uses appropriate technical terminology while remaining accessible. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) some mathematical formulations could be further explained for non-technical readers, (2) the relationship between the different loss functions could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some implementation details for the educational context integration could be more concrete."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements. The application of contrastive learning specifically for educational assessment contexts is novel, extending beyond general AI-generated text detection. The integration of education-specific features such as reasoning coherence analysis, knowledge consistency verification, and creativity metrics represents a fresh approach tailored to the educational domain. The multi-level feature extraction combined with domain adaptation for cross-subject generalization is also innovative. However, the core technical approach builds significantly on existing methods (ConDA, DeTeCtive, WhosAI) rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The proposal adapts and extends these approaches rather than creating an entirely new paradigm, which somewhat limits its novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The contrastive learning framework is mathematically formalized with appropriate loss functions, and the approach builds on established techniques from the literature. The multi-level feature extraction and domain adaptation components are well-justified based on prior work. The adversarial training process is properly formulated to enhance robustness. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including appropriate metrics and comparative benchmarks. The technical formulations appear correct and are presented clearly. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) the specific choice of similarity functions in the educational context integration, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the domain adaptation approach, and (3) more detailed analysis of potential limitations in the adversarial training process."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components, though it involves significant implementation challenges. The data collection approach is practical, leveraging collaborations with educational institutions and multiple LFMs. The model architecture builds on established techniques, making implementation straightforward for researchers with ML expertise. The evaluation methodology is well-defined and achievable. However, several aspects present feasibility challenges: (1) collecting 100,000+ paired responses across multiple domains will require substantial resources and coordination, (2) the multimodal integration across text, code, and mathematical expressions adds significant complexity, (3) achieving the targeted performance metrics (>95% accuracy, <2% false positives) may be overly optimistic given the current state of the field, and (4) the comprehensive evaluation across diverse educational contexts will require extensive testing resources. While ambitious, these challenges appear manageable with appropriate resources and expertise."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and timely problem in educational assessment with far-reaching implications. As AI tools become increasingly accessible to students, maintaining assessment integrity is essential for preserving the value of educational credentials. The significance is particularly high because: (1) it addresses a pressing need identified by educators and assessment professionals, (2) it has potential for immediate practical application in educational settings, (3) it contributes to both technical advancement (contrastive learning, domain adaptation) and educational practice, (4) it supports equitable assessment by reducing advantages gained through AI access, and (5) it enables the positive integration of AI in education while mitigating misuse. The open-source nature of the proposed framework further enhances its potential impact by democratizing access to detection capabilities across educational institutions."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This is an excellent proposal that addresses a critical need in educational assessment with a technically sound and innovative approach. It demonstrates strong alignment with the workshop focus, builds appropriately on existing literature, and presents a comprehensive methodology with clear expected outcomes. While there are some feasibility challenges and the core technical approach builds on existing methods rather than creating entirely new ones, the potential significance and impact of the work is substantial. The proposal successfully balances technical innovation with practical applicability in educational contexts.",
