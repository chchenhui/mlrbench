        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop topic of 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' and focuses on developing a contrastive learning framework (SecureED) to detect AI-generated responses in educational assessments, which is precisely what was outlined in the research idea. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, particularly drawing on contrastive learning approaches mentioned in papers like ConDA and DeTeCtive. It acknowledges the challenges identified in the literature review regarding detection accuracy, generalizability across domains, and adversarial evasion tactics. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed framework will address these challenges through multimodal datasets and fine-tuning with adversarial samples."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated with four specific research questions that guide the study. The methodology section provides a comprehensive outline of the research design, data collection, model development, and evaluation procedures. The contrastive learning objective is formally defined with mathematical notation, demonstrating technical precision. The evaluation metrics are also clearly specified with mathematical formulations. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific types of adversarial samples that will be used for fine-tuning could be more clearly defined, (2) the exact composition of the multimodal dataset (proportions of text, code, and mathematical expressions) could be more precisely specified, and (3) more details on the implementation of domain-specific features like 'reasoning coherence' and 'creativity patterns' would strengthen the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by applying contrastive learning specifically to educational assessment integrity, which represents a novel application domain. While contrastive learning for AI-generated text detection has been explored (as seen in the literature review with ConDA and DeTeCtive), the proposal innovates by: (1) focusing specifically on educational assessments rather than general text, (2) incorporating multimodal data including text, code, and mathematical expressions, and (3) emphasizing high-order thinking tasks. The integration of domain-specific features related to educational assessment (reasoning coherence, creativity patterns) also adds novelty. However, the core technical approach of contrastive learning for detection is built upon existing methods, and the proposal could benefit from more explicit discussion of how it advances beyond the current state-of-the-art approaches mentioned in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The contrastive learning framework is well-justified and formally defined with appropriate mathematical notation. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, including robustness tests against evasion tactics and comparisons to existing detectors. The metrics for evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) are appropriate and well-defined. The multi-stage research approach (data collection, model development, evaluation, integration) is logical and well-structured. The proposal is grounded in the existing literature on AI-generated text detection and contrastive learning approaches. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) more detailed discussion of potential limitations of the contrastive learning approach in this specific context, (2) consideration of potential biases in the dataset collection process, and (3) more explicit connection between the proposed method and the theoretical foundations of educational assessment validity."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible research plan with clearly defined stages and methodologies. The contrastive learning approach has been demonstrated in similar contexts (as shown in the literature review), suggesting technical feasibility. The data collection, model development, and evaluation procedures are realistic and achievable with current technologies and methods. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) collecting a sufficiently diverse and representative multimodal dataset of human and AI-generated responses across various subjects may be challenging and resource-intensive, (2) achieving robust performance against sophisticated evasion tactics may be difficult, as highlighted in the literature review, (3) ensuring the model generalizes across different subjects and question types is ambitious and may require significant fine-tuning and optimization. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of potential implementation challenges and mitigation strategies, as well as a more detailed timeline and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical and timely problem in educational assessment with far-reaching implications. As large foundation models become increasingly accessible to students, maintaining assessment integrity is a pressing concern for educational institutions worldwide. The development of a robust detection method would have significant impact by: (1) preserving the validity and reliability of educational assessments, (2) enabling the safe adoption of generative AI in educational settings, (3) promoting academic honesty and integrity, and (4) providing an open-source solution that could be widely adopted. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and connects them to broader educational goals. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's focus on creating guidelines for integration into existing assessment platforms, ensuring practical applicability. The literature review confirms the urgent need for improved detection methods, as current tools have significant limitations in accuracy and reliability."
