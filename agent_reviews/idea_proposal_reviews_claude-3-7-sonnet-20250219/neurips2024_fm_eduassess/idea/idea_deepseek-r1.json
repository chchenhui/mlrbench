        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The SecureED proposal aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on large foundation models for educational assessment, specifically addressing the 'Generative AI for assessment security and accountability' topic explicitly mentioned in the task description. The idea directly tackles the challenge of AI accountability mentioned in the workshop description, which notes that 'explainability and accountability of current large foundations models are still inadequate.' The proposal aims to develop a framework that ensures assessment integrity in the face of LFM usage by students, which is a critical concern for educational stakeholders as mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, proposed solution, and expected outcomes. The SecureED framework is defined as a contrastive learning approach using LFMs to distinguish between AI and human responses, with specific training data types (multimodal dataset including text, code, and math) and methodological approaches (fine-tuning with adversarial samples). The evaluation plan is also clearly outlined, including robustness tests against evasion tactics. There are some minor ambiguities about the specific technical implementation details of the contrastive learning framework and how domain-specific features will be incorporated, but these are reasonable omissions given the space constraints."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by proposing a contrastive learning framework specifically designed for educational assessment contexts. While AI-generated content detection is not new (with tools like GPTZero already mentioned in the proposal), SecureED's focus on educational assessments with emphasis on high-order thinking tasks and domain-specific features represents a novel application. The multimodal approach (text, code, math) and the focus on cross-domain generalizability also add innovative elements. However, the core technique of using contrastive learning for detection is an established approach, which somewhat limits the novelty score. The proposal builds upon existing detection methods rather than proposing a fundamentally new paradigm."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and resources. The proposal leverages existing LFMs and established contrastive learning techniques, making the technical implementation realistic. Creating the multimodal dataset with human/AI-generated pairs is achievable, especially with access to LFMs to generate the AI responses. The evaluation methodology comparing against existing detectors is straightforward. The main implementation challenges would likely be in achieving robust cross-domain generalizability and effectively handling adversarial evasion tactics, but these are acknowledged in the proposal and appear manageable given the current state of AI research. The development of an open-source API is also a realistic deliverable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical and timely problem in educational assessment as LFMs become increasingly accessible to students. The significance is high because assessment integrity directly impacts educational quality, credential validity, and institutional trust. The proposal has potential for substantial real-world impact through its open-source detection API and integration guidelines, which could be widely adopted by educational institutions. The work also balances the need for assessment security with the beneficial adoption of AI in education, addressing a tension explicitly mentioned in the workshop description. The focus on high-order thinking tasks is particularly significant as these are central to educational assessment and challenging for current detection methods."
