    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on large foundation models for educational assessment. It specifically addresses automated essay scoring using foundation models like GPT-4, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal directly tackles the explainability challenge highlighted in the task description as a key research challenge ('the explainability and accountability of current large foundations models are still inadequate to convince the stakeholders in the educational ecosystem'). The idea's focus on transparency, stakeholder trust, and educational accountability perfectly matches the workshop's call for 'Trustworthy AI (Fairness, Explainability, Privacy) for educational assessment.' The only minor reason it's not a perfect 10 is that it could have more explicitly connected to some other aspects mentioned in the workshop, such as assessment security."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly defines the problem (lack of transparency in automated essay scoring), proposes a specific solution (rationale-guided explanation module with structural and semantic rationales), and outlines evaluation criteria. The framework components are well-articulated, distinguishing between structural rationales (highlighting evidence in text) and semantic rationales (natural language explanations). The integration of rule-based constraints during fine-tuning is also clearly explained. However, some technical details could be further elaborated - for instance, how exactly the attention analysis will work to link text evidence to scoring rubrics, or how the rule-based constraints will be implemented during fine-tuning. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to explainable automated essay scoring. While explainable AI is not new, the specific application to large foundation models for educational assessment represents a fresh perspective. The dual approach of structural and semantic rationales is innovative, as is the integration of rule-based constraints during fine-tuning to align with pedagogical goals. However, the core techniques mentioned (attention analysis, natural language explanations) build upon existing XAI methods rather than introducing fundamentally new technical approaches. The novelty lies more in the application domain and the specific combination of techniques rather than in groundbreaking new methods, which is why it scores a 7 rather than higher."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. Large foundation models like GPT-4 already exist and have demonstrated strong capabilities in text analysis. Attention mechanisms and explanation generation are established techniques in the field. The evaluation metrics proposed (correlation with human scorers, stakeholder comprehension, robustness against adversarial inputs) are concrete and measurable. The integration of rule-based constraints during fine-tuning is technically achievable. The main implementation challenges would likely be in ensuring that the explanations are truly useful to educators and in gathering sufficient human evaluation data, but these are manageable challenges rather than fundamental barriers. The approach builds on existing technologies in a practical way, making it quite feasible to implement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in educational technology: the lack of transparency in AI-based assessment systems. The significance is high because: 1) It tackles a major barrier to adoption of AI in high-stakes educational contexts; 2) It has potential for broad impact across educational institutions and assessment platforms; 3) It addresses ethical concerns about fairness and accountability in AI-driven education; 4) It could bridge the gap between advanced AI capabilities and human-centered educational values; and 5) Success could lead to wider acceptance of AI tools in education while maintaining human oversight. The potential to transform how automated scoring is implemented in real educational settings, while empowering educators rather than replacing them, makes this work particularly significant."
