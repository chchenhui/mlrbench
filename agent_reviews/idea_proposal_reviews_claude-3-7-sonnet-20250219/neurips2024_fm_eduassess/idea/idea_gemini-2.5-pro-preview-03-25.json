        "justification": "The CHAIN-OF-RUBRIC idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on large foundation models for educational assessment. It directly addresses one of the explicitly mentioned topics: 'Large foundation models for automated scoring' and tackles the challenge of explainability, which the task description identifies as a key limitation for adoption in educational contexts. The proposal specifically targets the workshop's concern that 'the explainability and accountability of current large foundations models are still inadequate to convince the stakeholders in the educational ecosystem.' The idea of fine-tuning LFMs to provide rubric-grounded explanations is highly relevant to the workshop's goals of improving trustworthiness in AI-driven assessment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (lack of explainability in LFM-based scoring), proposes a specific solution (CHAIN-OF-RUBRIC fine-tuning and prompting strategy), and outlines the expected outputs (final score plus textual explanation grounded in rubric criteria). The methodology involving fine-tuning on datasets with expert scores and feedback chains is mentioned, though it could benefit from more details on the specific fine-tuning approach, dataset requirements, and evaluation metrics. The concept of 'rubric-based feedback chains' could be more precisely defined. Overall, the core concept is presented with sufficient clarity that researchers in both AI and educational assessment would understand the proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing concepts (chain-of-thought prompting, rubric-based assessment, and LFM fine-tuning) in a novel way specifically for educational assessment. While chain-of-thought approaches have been explored in other contexts, the specific application to rubric-grounded educational assessment represents a fresh perspective. The innovation lies in the explicit connection between the model's reasoning process and established educational rubrics, creating a bridge between AI capabilities and educational assessment standards. However, it builds upon rather than fundamentally reimagines existing techniques. The approach is an intelligent adaptation and combination of known methods rather than a completely groundbreaking concept, which is why it scores well but not at the highest levels of novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach appears highly feasible with current technology. Fine-tuning LFMs for specific tasks is a well-established practice, and chain-of-thought prompting has been demonstrated to be effective across various reasoning tasks. The main technical components required (LFMs, fine-tuning pipelines, datasets with rubric-aligned feedback) all exist. The primary challenge would be creating high-quality training datasets that pair student responses with expert-generated rubric-grounded explanations, which would require significant effort but is certainly achievable. The approach doesn't require new model architectures or fundamentally new AI capabilities, making it implementable with existing resources and knowledge. The incremental nature of the innovation contributes to its high feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical barrier to the adoption of AI in educational assessment: the lack of explainability and transparency. By making LFM-based scoring more interpretable and aligned with established educational rubrics, it could significantly increase stakeholder trust and adoption of these technologies in real educational settings. The impact extends beyond technical improvement to practical utility for educators (who need to understand and trust automated assessments), students (who benefit from specific, actionable feedback), and policymakers (who require transparent, justifiable assessment systems). The approach could bridge the gap between AI capabilities and educational requirements, potentially transforming how automated assessment is implemented in practice. The alignment with both technical advancement and real-world educational needs makes this idea particularly significant."
