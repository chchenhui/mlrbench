    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on causal representation learning that goes beyond statistical correlations to support intervention, reasoning, and planning. The methodology incorporates counterfactual interventions in a VAE framework with a contrastive objective, exactly as outlined in the research idea. The proposal builds upon the literature review by addressing identifiability challenges (Ahuja et al., 2022), incorporating causal disentanglement (similar to An et al., 2023 and Wang et al., 2023), and leveraging counterfactual interventions (Li et al., 2024). The evaluation metrics and datasets are appropriate for the task, focusing on disentanglement, OOD generalization, and downstream planning tasks, which align with the workshop's topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented with precise mathematical formulations. The CAC-VAE framework is thoroughly explained with its four components (probabilistic encoder, intervention module, normalizing flow decoder, and contrastive causal objective) clearly defined. The training objective combines multiple loss terms with clear justification. The experimental design specifies datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for ensuring that counterfactuals remain realistic and on the data manifold, (2) more details on how the normalizing flow decoder is structured, and (3) further explanation of the consistency term in the total loss function."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of counterfactual interventions with contrastive learning in a VAE framework is innovative, particularly the approach to simulating atomic interventions in latent space and using them to enforce causal disentanglement. The use of a normalizing flow decoder to ensure counterfactuals remain on the data manifold is also a creative solution. However, the core components (VAEs, contrastive learning, interventions in latent space) have been explored separately in prior work. For example, Fan et al. (2023) used causal flows in VAEs, and Li et al. (2024) employed counterfactual interventions. The proposal extends these ideas rather than introducing entirely new concepts, making it incrementally innovative rather than groundbreaking."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks. The mathematical formulations for the VAE architecture, intervention mechanism, and contrastive objective are correctly presented and justified. The approach builds on solid foundations from causal inference, representation learning, and generative modeling. The training objective appropriately combines reconstruction, regularization, contrastive, and consistency terms. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets and baselines for evaluation. The metrics chosen (DCI score, intervention robustness, OOD accuracy) are suitable for assessing causal disentanglement and generalization. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the theoretical guarantees for identifiability of causal factors, (2) the relationship between the contrastive objective and true causal independence, and (3) how the approach handles potential confounding between latent factors."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods. VAEs, normalizing flows, and contrastive learning are well-established techniques with available implementations. The datasets mentioned (dSprites, CLEVR, DomainNet, Causal3DIdent) are accessible and have been used in similar research. The evaluation metrics are computable and have precedent in the literature. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) training normalizing flows can be computationally intensive and potentially unstable, (2) balancing the multiple terms in the loss function will require careful hyperparameter tuning, (3) ensuring that the counterfactual interventions produce realistic images while maintaining causal consistency could be difficult in complex datasets, and (4) the evaluation on downstream planning tasks will require additional infrastructure beyond the core representation learning framework. These challenges are manageable but will require substantial engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current machine learning systems: the inability to reason causally about interventions and counterfactuals. If successful, the approach would contribute significantly to the field of causal representation learning by providing a method to learn disentangled causal factors without supervision. The potential applications in healthcare imaging and autonomous systems are important and impactful. The expected improvements in OOD generalization (â‰¥15% higher accuracy) would represent a substantial advance over current methods. The theoretical contributions regarding the relationship between contrastive learning and causal disentanglement would also be valuable to the research community. The proposal aligns well with the workshop's goal of developing representations that support robustness, explainability, and transferability. While not completely transformative of the field, it represents a significant step forward in making representation learning more causally grounded."
