        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on theoretical foundations of foundation models, particularly addressing the 'Efficiency' theme. The proposal directly tackles data-efficient fine-tuning strategies, which is explicitly listed as an interested topic. The information-theoretic approach to data selection addresses the workshop's call for theoretical tools to improve data efficiency in training or fine-tuning foundation models. The proposal also touches on democratizing access to resource-constrained users, which aligns with the workshop's concern about deployment costs and energy consumption of foundation models."

        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The two-stage approach is explicitly defined: (1) theoretical analysis of sample influence via mutual information bounds, and (2) an adaptive algorithm for batch prioritization. The technical components (joint mutual information, gradient-based approximations, kernelized embeddings) are specified, though some technical details about the implementation of these components could be further elaborated. The expected outcome of 40-60% data reduction is quantitatively stated, providing a concrete benchmark for success."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by applying information-theoretic principles, specifically joint mutual information, to the problem of data selection for fine-tuning foundation models. While information theory has been applied to various machine learning problems before, the specific application to foundation model fine-tuning with a focus on joint mutual information between data points and model parameters appears to offer a fresh perspective. The integration of gradient-based approximations with kernelized embeddings for handling high-dimensional FM outputs also shows innovation. However, the core concept of using information-theoretic measures for data selection builds upon existing work in active learning and core-set selection, rather than introducing a completely novel paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with existing techniques and knowledge. The information-theoretic framework and gradient-based approximations are established methodologies that can be adapted to this context. The proposal acknowledges scalability challenges and offers solutions through approximation techniques. However, computing mutual information in high-dimensional spaces (as with foundation model parameters) is notoriously difficult, and the effectiveness of the proposed approximations may vary. The ambitious goal of 40-60% data reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy may be challenging to achieve consistently across different foundation models and tasks. The implementation would likely require significant computational resources for experimentation with large foundation models, though the end goal is to reduce overall computation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical challenge in the foundation model ecosystem: the high computational and environmental costs of fine-tuning. If successful, the 40-60% reduction in data requirements would substantially lower barriers to FM customization, democratizing access and reducing environmental impact. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's emphasis on efficiency and sustainability. The theoretical contributions could extend beyond foundation models to other data-intensive learning paradigms. The work bridges theory and practice by providing principled methods with practical implementations. The significance is somewhat limited by its focus on the fine-tuning stage rather than pre-training, which is where the bulk of computational resources are consumed, but the impact on accessibility of FM customization remains substantial."
