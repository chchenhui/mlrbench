    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on neural network weights as a data modality. It directly addresses several key dimensions outlined in the task description: weight space properties (specifically symmetries like permutations), weight space learning paradigms (using equivariant GNNs and contrastive learning), model/weight analysis (inferring model properties from weights), and applications (model retrieval and lineage analysis). The proposal specifically tackles the challenge of creating invariant embeddings that respect weight space symmetries, which is explicitly mentioned as a key research question in the workshop description. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address the theoretical foundations dimension, though it implicitly touches on expressivity through its approach."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (analyzing models efficiently despite weight space symmetries), the proposed solution (equivariant GNNs with contrastive learning), and expected outcomes (invariant embeddings for cross-architecture comparisons). The methodology is well-defined: treating weight tensors as graphs, using permutation-equivariant GNNs, and training via contrastive loss. The validation approach is also specified. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how exactly the weight tensors would be represented as graphs (what would be nodes vs. edges) and how the contrastive learning pairs would be constructed, which would need further elaboration in a full proposal."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. While equivariant GNNs and contrastive learning are established techniques, applying them specifically to create invariant embeddings of neural network weights that respect architectural symmetries represents a novel approach. The focus on creating a unified embedding space for cross-architecture comparisons is particularly innovative. However, there are existing works on model embedding spaces and using graph-based representations for neural networks, so the core components aren't entirely new. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and application to model zoo analysis rather than in introducing fundamentally new techniques."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Equivariant GNNs and contrastive learning frameworks are well-established, and there are existing model zoo datasets that could be used for validation. The computational requirements, while significant, are within reach of modern research infrastructure. However, there are moderate challenges: (1) representing large neural networks as graphs could be computationally intensive, (2) defining appropriate contrastive pairs that capture functional similarity might require careful design, and (3) ensuring the approach generalizes across vastly different architectures (e.g., CNNs vs. Transformers) could be difficult. These challenges are surmountable but would require careful implementation and possibly some methodological refinements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant problem with high potential impact. As model repositories grow to millions of models, efficient analysis and retrieval become critical challenges. Creating invariant embeddings would enable numerous valuable applications: model retrieval based on functional properties, lineage analysis, detecting backdoored models, and providing foundations for model editing/merging. These capabilities could substantially accelerate research and democratize access to pretrained models. The significance is particularly high given the workshop's focus on establishing weights as a new data modality - this research would provide essential tools for that paradigm. The main limitation to significance is that the initial applications might be more incremental than transformative, though the long-term impact could be substantial."
