    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on neural network weights as a new data modality, specifically targeting the 'Weight Space Learning Tasks/Learning Paradigms' and 'Applications of Weight Space Learning' dimensions mentioned in the task. The proposal implements the exact idea of permutation-equivariant contrastive embeddings for model zoo retrieval, maintaining all key components: the GNN-based encoder, contrastive learning approach, and focus on respecting weight space symmetries. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing the identified challenges of capturing weight space symmetries, scalability to large model zoos, and contrastive learning in high-dimensional spaces. The mathematical formulation and experimental design are consistent with the research goals outlined in both the task description and idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and motivation. Research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the algorithmic steps, including a mathematical formulation of the contrastive loss function. The experimental design outlines specific evaluation metrics and comparison approaches. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact structure of the GNN encoder could be more precisely defined, (2) The process for generating positive and negative pairs during training could be more detailed, and (3) The relationship between the embedding space and the downstream task performance could be further elaborated. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The application of permutation-equivariant GNNs to neural network weight spaces for model retrieval represents a fresh approach to the model selection problem. The use of contrastive learning specifically tailored for weight space embeddings, with symmetry-preserving augmentations as positive pairs, is innovative. However, the core components (GNNs, contrastive learning, weight space analysis) individually appear in the literature review, particularly in references like 'Geometric Flow Models over Neural Network Weights,' 'Contrastive Learning for Neural Network Weight Representations,' and 'Permutation-Invariant Neural Network Embeddings for Model Retrieval.' While the proposal integrates these concepts effectively for a specific application, it doesn't introduce fundamentally new theoretical frameworks or algorithms. The novelty lies more in the application and combination rather than in creating entirely new methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks. The use of graph neural networks to respect permutation symmetries in weight matrices is theoretically justified, as is the contrastive learning approach for embedding similar models closer in the latent space. The mathematical formulation of the contrastive loss is correctly specified and appropriate for the task. The experimental design includes relevant metrics (retrieval precision, clustering coherence, downstream fine-tuning efficiency) that align well with the research objectives. The proposal also acknowledges the inherent symmetries in neural network weights (permutations, scaling) and designs the methodology to explicitly account for these properties. The approach to representing weight matrices as graphs with neurons as nodes and connections as edges is theoretically sound. One minor limitation is that the proposal could provide more details on how the method would handle different neural network architectures (e.g., CNNs vs. Transformers) and varying layer types, but overall, the technical foundations are robust and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction with some implementation challenges. The core components—GNNs, contrastive learning, and model embedding—are well-established techniques with available implementations. The data collection plan leveraging existing model repositories like Hugging Face is practical. However, several aspects present moderate challenges: (1) Scaling to 'millions of models' as mentioned in the introduction would require significant computational resources for both embedding generation and retrieval, (2) Handling diverse neural network architectures with varying layer types and connectivity patterns would require careful engineering, (3) The generation of meaningful positive pairs through symmetry-preserving augmentations might be complex to implement efficiently, and (4) Evaluating the quality of retrieved models across diverse downstream tasks would be resource-intensive. While these challenges are substantial, they don't render the proposal infeasible—rather, they suggest that the scope might need to be carefully managed or that the initial implementation might focus on a more constrained subset of models and tasks before scaling up."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly relevant problem with significant potential impact. As model repositories continue to grow exponentially, efficient methods for model retrieval based on functional similarity rather than metadata become increasingly valuable. The proposed approach could substantially reduce computational waste from redundant training, democratize access to suitable pre-trained models, and accelerate research progress across various domains. The significance extends beyond the immediate application to model retrieval, potentially influencing related areas such as neural architecture search, transfer learning, and model merging. The proposal directly addresses several key questions from the workshop description, particularly regarding efficient representation and manipulation of weights and democratizing the usage of weight spaces. The impact would be particularly strong for practitioners with limited computational resources who could benefit most from finding suitable pre-trained models. While the immediate application is focused on model retrieval, the broader implications for understanding weight spaces and functional similarities between models give this proposal substantial significance in the field."
