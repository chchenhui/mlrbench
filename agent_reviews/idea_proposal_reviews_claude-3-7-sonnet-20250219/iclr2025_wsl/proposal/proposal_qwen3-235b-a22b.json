        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of model zoo retrieval through permutation-equivariant contrastive embeddings, which is central to the workshop's focus on neural network weights as a data modality. The proposal incorporates key aspects from the literature review, including weight space symmetries (references [1], [5], [9]), graph neural networks for weight analysis (references [4], [8]), and contrastive learning approaches (references [6], [10]). The methodology specifically addresses permutation and scaling symmetries mentioned in the task description and builds upon the geometric approaches in the cited literature. The proposal's focus on model retrieval directly supports the workshop's goal of democratizing weight space usage and making training more efficient."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical formulations are precise and well-presented, with appropriate mathematical notation and clear explanations of the permutation-equivariant GNN encoder, contrastive learning framework, and evaluation protocol. The figures are referenced but not provided, which is a minor limitation. Some sections, particularly in the theoretical justification, could benefit from more detailed explanations of how the equivariance properties are maintained through the entire pipeline. The experimental design is comprehensive, though some details about implementation specifics (e.g., exact hyperparameters, computational requirements) could be more explicit."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel combination of permutation-equivariant graph neural networks and contrastive learning specifically designed for model zoo retrieval. While individual components like GNNs for weight analysis [8] and contrastive learning for embeddings [6] have been explored, the integration of these approaches with explicit handling of weight space symmetries represents a fresh perspective. The proposal extends Geom-GCN [4] with permutation-equivariant message passing, which is an innovative adaptation. However, the core techniques (GNNs, contrastive learning) are established, and similar symmetry-aware embeddings have been discussed in the literature [9]. The augmentation strategies and loss function design show creativity, but they build incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of permutation symmetry properties is precise, and the equivariant graph processing approach is well-justified. The theoretical guarantees in Appendix A provide formal backing for the equivariance claims, though the proof is only sketched. The contrastive learning framework is soundly designed with appropriate positive and negative pair construction. The experimental design includes comprehensive evaluation protocols with multiple metrics and baselines. The proposal acknowledges limitations and provides theoretical bounds on embedding distance preservation under transformations. The integration of both unsupervised contrastive learning and supervised performance prediction in the loss function is theoretically well-motivated. One minor weakness is that the theoretical analysis could be more comprehensive regarding convergence properties and sample complexity."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined implementation steps. The weight-to-graph conversion, GNN encoder, and contrastive learning framework are all implementable with current technology and methods. The dataset curation plan is realistic, drawing from existing model repositories. However, there are some practical challenges that may affect implementation: (1) The computational requirements for processing 55k models from diverse architectures could be substantial; (2) The conversion between heterogeneous architectures (CNNâ†’ViT via meta-wrapper generation) is mentioned but not fully detailed; (3) The scalability of the approach to very large models is not thoroughly addressed. The evaluation protocol is well-designed and practical, though the oracle test for symmetry robustness may require significant computational resources. Overall, the approach is implementable but would require careful optimization and potentially substantial computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the machine learning community: efficient discovery and reuse of pre-trained models in increasingly large model zoos. The potential impact is substantial, with the authors projecting a ~40% reduction in training compute through optimized model retrieval. The work bridges multiple research areas (weight space analysis, geometric deep learning, transfer learning) and could significantly influence how practitioners approach model selection and reuse. The proposed open-sourced API and benchmark datasets would provide valuable infrastructure for the community. The theoretical contributions regarding permutation-equivariant embeddings extend beyond the immediate application to model retrieval and could influence other areas of weight space learning. The work directly addresses several key questions from the workshop description, particularly regarding efficient representation of weights and democratizing weight space usage. While the immediate application is focused on retrieval, the broader implications for model editing, meta-optimization, and security applications demonstrate significant potential for long-term impact."
