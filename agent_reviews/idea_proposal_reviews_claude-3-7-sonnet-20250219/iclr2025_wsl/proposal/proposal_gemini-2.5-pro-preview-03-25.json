        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on neural network weights as a data modality, particularly emphasizing weight space symmetries (permutations, scaling) as highlighted in the task description. The PEACE framework implements the permutation-equivariant contrastive embeddings concept from the research idea, using GNNs to process weight tensors while respecting symmetries. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like Erdogan (2025) for symmetry-aware models, Sun et al. (2023) for GNN feature expansion, and Eilertsen et al. (2020) for weight space analysis. It also addresses all five key challenges identified in the literature review, from capturing weight space symmetries to evaluation metrics for model retrieval. The methodology is comprehensive and well-structured, covering data collection, encoder architecture, contrastive learning framework, and experimental validation."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. Key concepts are defined clearly, including the permutation-equivariant architecture, contrastive learning framework, and evaluation methods. The technical details of the GNN-based encoder and the contrastive learning approach are explained thoroughly, with mathematical formulations provided where appropriate. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the significance of the work is well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, with clear tasks and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for handling weight scaling symmetries could be more precisely defined, (2) the details of how permutation augmentations would be implemented across multiple layers could be elaborated, and (3) some technical aspects of the network-level aggregation could be more explicitly formulated. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity of the proposal is strong."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to model zoo retrieval by combining several innovative elements. The core novelty lies in the development of a permutation-equivariant architecture specifically designed for neural network weights, which respects the inherent symmetries of weight spaces. While GNNs and contrastive learning are established techniques, their application to weight space analysis in this manner is innovative. The proposal extends beyond existing work by: (1) developing a hierarchical encoder that processes individual layers with symmetry awareness before aggregating to network-level embeddings, (2) designing a contrastive learning framework specifically tailored for weight space with symmetry-preserving augmentations, and (3) creating a comprehensive retrieval system for model zoos that leverages functional similarity rather than metadata. The approach builds upon ideas mentioned in the literature review (particularly hypothetical papers 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) but integrates them in a novel way and adds significant technical contributions. While some individual components have precedents, their combination and adaptation to the specific challenges of weight space analysis represents a meaningful advancement."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a methodology that builds on established techniques in graph neural networks and contrastive learning. The approach to handling permutation symmetries through equivariant GNNs is theoretically justified, and the contrastive learning framework is well-designed with appropriate positive and negative pair generation strategies. The experimental design includes comprehensive evaluation tasks and metrics that align with the research objectives. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The mathematical formulation of the permutation equivariance property could be more precise, particularly regarding how the GNN operations commute with permutations. (2) The handling of scaling symmetries is mentioned but not fully developed mathematically. (3) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of handling different layer types and architectures in a unified framework. (4) Some claims about the effectiveness of the approach for transfer learning would benefit from more theoretical justification. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and based on solid theoretical foundations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the research leverages existing techniques (GNNs, contrastive learning) and builds on established frameworks. The data collection strategy is realistic, focusing on publicly available models from repositories like Hugging Face. The evaluation methodology is well-defined and achievable. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Implementing permutation-equivariant GNNs that properly handle the complex symmetries of neural networks across different architectures is technically challenging. (2) The computational resources required for processing large model zoos could be substantial, especially when generating embeddings for diverse architectures. (3) Creating valid permutation augmentations that maintain functional equivalence across multiple layers requires careful implementation. (4) The proposal aims to handle multiple architecture types (CNNs, Transformers, MLPs) which significantly increases complexity. (5) Curating ground truth for functional similarity to evaluate retrieval performance is non-trivial. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively suggest that the full scope of the proposal might require significant resources and potential scope adjustments during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem with substantial potential impact. As model repositories grow to millions of entries, efficient retrieval based on functional similarity rather than metadata becomes increasingly critical. The research directly addresses multiple key questions from the workshop, particularly regarding efficient representation of weights, democratizing the usage of weight spaces, and leveraging weight properties for optimization. The expected outcomes would provide both theoretical contributions (understanding weight space symmetries and functional encoding) and practical tools (efficient model retrieval system). The work has the potential to: (1) significantly reduce computational waste by enabling more effective model reuse, (2) democratize access to suitable pre-trained models for researchers with limited resources, (3) advance fundamental understanding of neural network weight spaces, and (4) establish a new paradigm for model selection in transfer learning. The proposal connects multiple research areas (equivariant deep learning, contrastive learning, and model zoo analysis) in a way that could inspire further cross-disciplinary work. Given the exponential growth in available pre-trained models, this research addresses a timely and increasingly important challenge in machine learning."
