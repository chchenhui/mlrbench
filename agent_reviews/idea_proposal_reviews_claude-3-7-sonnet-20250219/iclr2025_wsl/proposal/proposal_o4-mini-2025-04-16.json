    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on neural network weights as a new data modality, specifically targeting the 'Weight Space Learning Tasks' and 'Applications of Weight Space Learning' dimensions mentioned in the task. The proposal's core methodology—using permutation-equivariant GNNs for weight embedding—builds directly on the research idea of creating embeddings that respect weight symmetries. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with explicit references to works on geometric flow models (Erdogan 2025), meta-classification (Eilertsen 2020), and various anonymous works on permutation-invariant embeddings and contrastive learning in weight spaces. The proposal addresses key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly regarding weight space symmetries, scalability to large model zoos, and contrastive learning in high-dimensional spaces."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem context and motivation. The methodology section is particularly strong, with detailed mathematical formulations of the permutation-equivariant graph encoder, contrastive learning objective, and evaluation metrics. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering baselines, ablation studies, and multiple evaluation approaches. The expected outcomes are concrete and measurable. There are a few minor areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for handling models with different architectures and depths could be more explicitly described, (2) the relationship between the supervised loss component and the contrastive objective could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of permutation augmentations could be more precisely specified. Overall, however, the proposal presents a clear and coherent research plan."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The core innovation lies in applying permutation-equivariant graph neural networks specifically to neural network weight spaces for model retrieval, with symmetry-preserving augmentations for contrastive learning. While individual components (GNNs, contrastive learning, permutation equivariance) have been explored in prior work cited in the literature review, their integration for the specific purpose of model zoo retrieval represents a fresh approach. The proposal extends beyond previous work on permutation-invariant embeddings (2024) and contrastive weight space learning (2023, 2025) by incorporating layer-wise graph structure and full symmetry equivariance. However, it builds incrementally on these existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new theoretical concepts or architectures. The symmetry-preserving augmentations for contrastive learning are a creative contribution, though similar ideas have been explored in other domains."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulation of the permutation-equivariant graph encoder is precise and well-justified, with clear connections to established GNN literature. The contrastive learning framework with symmetry-preserving augmentations is theoretically sound, addressing the key symmetries in neural network weight spaces (permutations and scalings). The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, with appropriate metrics for retrieval (Precision@k, MRR), clustering (ARI, NMI), and transfer learning efficiency. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contribution of each component. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and includes appropriate baselines for comparison. One minor weakness is that the theoretical guarantees of equivariance could be more formally proven, though the intuition is clear. Additionally, while the proposal mentions scaling to 1 million models, the computational complexity analysis could be more detailed. Overall, the technical approach is rigorous and well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic scope and resource requirements. The methodology builds on established techniques in graph neural networks and contrastive learning, which have mature implementations available. The data collection strategy (50,000-100,000 models from Hugging Face) is ambitious but achievable. The training procedure, with AdamW optimizer and 200 epochs, is reasonable for the task. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and measurable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) efficiently implementing permutation augmentations for large networks, (2) scaling the approach to handle very diverse network architectures, (3) managing the computational resources needed for processing tens of thousands of models, and (4) ensuring that the graph representation can adequately capture the functional properties of complex architectures like transformers. While these challenges are substantial, they do not render the proposal infeasible, but rather indicate areas requiring careful implementation and potential optimization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a highly significant problem with substantial potential impact. As model repositories continue to grow exponentially, efficient retrieval methods based on functional similarity rather than metadata will become increasingly valuable. The expected outcomes—improved retrieval precision, transfer learning speedups, and a public benchmark—would make meaningful contributions to the field. The broader impacts identified, including reduced computational waste and democratized access to optimal pre-trained models, align well with important community goals. The work could significantly influence how practitioners approach model selection and transfer learning, potentially changing standard workflows in applied deep learning. The proposal also lays groundwork for future research in model merging, weight interpolation, and generative weight modeling. While the immediate application is focused on model retrieval, the permutation-equivariant embeddings could enable various downstream applications in model analysis and synthesis. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on a single application (retrieval) rather than a broader theoretical advancement, but within this scope, the potential impact is substantial."
