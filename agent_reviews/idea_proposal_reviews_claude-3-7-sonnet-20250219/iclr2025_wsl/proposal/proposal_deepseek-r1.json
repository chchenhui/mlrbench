    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on neural network weights as a new data modality, particularly in the areas of weight space learning, model analysis, and applications. The proposal's core concept of permutation-equivariant contrastive embeddings for model zoo retrieval perfectly matches the research idea's focus on leveraging weight space symmetries for model discovery. The methodology incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including symmetry-aware embeddings, graph neural networks for weight analysis, and contrastive learning approaches. The proposal comprehensively addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as capturing weight space symmetries, scalability to large model zoos, and contrastive learning in high-dimensional spaces."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the permutation-equivariant encoder architecture, including mathematical formulations of the graph construction, equivariant GNN layers, and contrastive learning framework. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-defined baselines and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes and broader impact are clearly articulated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification, such as more details on how the framework will handle different neural network architectures (e.g., transformers vs. CNNs) and the specific implementation of the symmetry-preserving augmentations."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining permutation-equivariant graph neural networks with contrastive learning specifically for model zoo retrieval. While both GNNs and contrastive learning are established techniques, their application to neural network weight spaces with explicit handling of symmetries represents a fresh perspective. The approach of treating weight matrices as graphs where neurons are nodes and connections are edges is innovative in the context of model retrieval. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing work in symmetry-aware embeddings and graph neural networks for weight analysis, as mentioned in the literature review. The contrastive learning framework, while well-adapted to the problem, follows standard practices in the field. The proposal offers a novel combination of existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks. The permutation-equivariant GNN architecture is mathematically well-formulated, with clear descriptions of message passing, aggregation, and update functions that respect the symmetries of neural network weights. The contrastive learning framework is based on the well-established NT-Xent loss, with appropriate considerations for positive and negative pair selection. The experimental design includes comprehensive baselines and evaluation metrics that directly address the research objectives. The proposal acknowledges the computational requirements and provides realistic implementation details. The only minor concerns are the lack of detailed analysis of potential failure modes and limited discussion of how the approach would handle very large models (e.g., LLMs) where full weight processing might be computationally prohibitive."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic resource requirements. The data collection strategy of curating 10,000 pre-trained models from Hugging Face is practical, and the preprocessing steps are clearly defined. The implementation details specify reasonable architectural choices (4-layer GNN with hidden dimension 256) and training parameters. The hardware requirements (4x A100 GPUs with ~48 hours training time) are substantial but within the range of typical deep learning research projects. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) processing very large models might be computationally challenging, (2) generating meaningful symmetry-preserving augmentations across diverse architectures could be complex, and (3) the proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the heterogeneity of model architectures in the zoo. These challenges don't render the project infeasible but may require additional engineering efforts or scope adjustments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in modern machine learning: efficiently discovering functionally relevant pre-trained models in increasingly large model zoos. The potential impact is substantial, as successful implementation could significantly reduce redundant training, democratize access to state-of-the-art models, and accelerate research in model merging and meta-learning. The expected outcomes include concrete improvements over metadata-based retrieval methods (>90% precision@10, outperforming metadata-based methods by â‰¥30%) and significant efficiency gains in fine-tuning (50% fewer steps). These outcomes would represent meaningful advances in the field. The broader impact section convincingly argues for computational cost savings and theoretical advancements. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on model retrieval rather than addressing the full spectrum of weight space learning applications mentioned in the workshop description, but within its scope, the proposal has high potential impact."
