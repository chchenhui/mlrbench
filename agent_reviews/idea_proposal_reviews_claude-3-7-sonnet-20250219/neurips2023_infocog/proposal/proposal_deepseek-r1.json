    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the InfoCog workshop's focus on information-theoretic principles in cognitive systems, particularly the application of information theory to human-AI collaboration. The proposal builds upon the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle as suggested in the research idea, extending it to create adaptive communication policies for human-AI cooperative tasks. The methodology incorporates variational IB methods within a reinforcement learning framework, consistent with the original idea. The proposal also effectively integrates insights from the literature review, citing relevant work like Tucker et al.'s VQ-VIB (2022) and acknowledging Srivastava et al.'s PLLB (2024) as a baseline. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review highlights challenges like real-time adaptation, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed how it overcomes all the identified challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the problem formulation is presented with precise mathematical notation. The algorithmic framework is detailed with specific components (encoder, predictor, compression regularizer) and their mathematical formulations. The experimental design includes concrete tasks, data collection methods, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism by which the meta-learner uses physiological signals to adjust β could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the communication signal S and actual human-interpretable outputs could be more explicitly described, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the variational approximation could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty in several aspects. It innovatively applies the Information Bottleneck principle to human-AI communication in cooperative tasks, extending beyond the typical applications in representation learning. The adaptive compression mechanism that dynamically adjusts based on human cognitive load is particularly novel, as most existing IB applications use fixed compression parameters. The integration of human physiological signals for meta-learning the compression parameter β is an innovative approach not commonly seen in the literature. However, the core technical approach builds significantly on existing methods like variational IB and PPO, and the proposal acknowledges similarities to prior work such as VQ-VIB (Tucker et al., 2022) and PLLB (Srivastava et al., 2024). While the application domain and adaptive components are novel, the fundamental algorithmic innovations are incremental rather than revolutionary."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with a well-grounded theoretical foundation in information theory and reinforcement learning. The mathematical formulation of the Information Bottleneck objective is correct and properly applied to the human-AI communication context. The variational approximation of mutual information terms is consistent with established methods in the field. The integration of IB principles with reinforcement learning through an augmented reward function is technically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that cover both task performance and human factors. The proposal also acknowledges relevant prior work and builds upon established methods. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) the statistical power analysis for the human studies is not provided, (2) the exact formulation of how the meta-learner works could be more precisely defined, and (3) potential limitations of the variational approximation for complex, high-dimensional state spaces are not fully addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and reasonable scope. The technical approach builds on established methods in variational information bottleneck and reinforcement learning, which have proven implementations. The experimental design includes both simulated environments and human studies, providing a practical path to validation. The baseline comparisons are well-chosen and implementable. However, there are several feasibility concerns: (1) collecting and interpreting human physiological signals (eye-tracking, response latency) for real-time adaptation of the compression parameter is technically challenging and may require specialized equipment, (2) recruiting 50 participants for human studies across multiple tasks represents a significant logistical effort, (3) the computational resources required for training RL agents with variational IB in complex environments may be substantial, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address the challenges of creating interpretable signals that humans can easily understand, especially in complex tasks. While ambitious, most components are achievable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in human-AI collaboration: optimizing communication to balance informativeness and cognitive load. This has significant implications for numerous applications including healthcare, robotics, and education. The theoretical contribution of extending IB principles to human-AI communication provides a principled framework for future research in this area. The expected outcomes include substantial improvements in task performance (15-20% higher success rates) and human experience (25% lower cognitive load), which would represent meaningful advances. The work bridges multiple disciplines including information theory, machine learning, and cognitive science, aligning well with the interdisciplinary goals of the InfoCog workshop. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications in assistive robotics, manufacturing, and education. The proposal also addresses the important challenge of AI transparency by making communication more interpretable. While the immediate impact is focused on specific collaborative tasks, the principles and methods could generalize to a wide range of human-AI interaction scenarios, making this work potentially highly influential."
