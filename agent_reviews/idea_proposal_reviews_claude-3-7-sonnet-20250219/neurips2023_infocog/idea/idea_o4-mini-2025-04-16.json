        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, particularly with the topic of 'Application of information theory to training human-aligned artificial agents, i.e., agents that can better communicate and cooperate with humans.' The proposed Hierarchical Variational Information Bottleneck (HVIB) directly applies information-theoretic principles to create AI systems that can better collaborate with humans by compressing representations to preserve only human-relevant features. The idea also touches on interdisciplinary aspects by connecting machine learning with human cognition, which is a core focus of the InfoCog workshop. The proposal clearly addresses the special emphasis on computation/estimation of information-theoretic quantities through its use of neural mutual-information estimators."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation is concisely stated, the problem is well-defined, and the proposed solution (HVIB) is explained with appropriate mathematical formalism. The objective function Lᵢ = βᵢ I(zᵢ;X) − I(zᵢ;Y_h∣z_{<i}) clearly specifies what is being optimized. The hierarchical nature of the representation is explained, with early layers capturing coarse features and deeper layers refining nuances. The evaluation plan on cooperative navigation and language-grounded dialogue tasks is mentioned, along with specific metrics. However, some minor details could be further elaborated, such as how exactly the neural mutual-information estimators will be implemented and how the hierarchical structure will be designed in practice."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by applying the information bottleneck principle in a hierarchical manner specifically for human-AI alignment. While the information bottleneck concept itself is not new in machine learning, its hierarchical application focused on preserving information predictive of human feedback represents a fresh approach. The integration of human feedback (Y_h) into the information-theoretic framework is particularly innovative. However, the approach builds upon existing methods (information bottleneck, variational bounds, neural mutual-information estimators) rather than introducing fundamentally new theoretical constructs. The novelty lies more in the specific application and combination of these techniques for human-aligned agents rather than in creating entirely new information-theoretic principles."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears quite feasible with current technology and methods. The information bottleneck principle has been successfully implemented in various contexts, and neural estimators for mutual information exist. The hierarchical structure adds complexity but remains implementable. The proposed evaluation on cooperative navigation and language-grounded dialogue tasks is reasonable and achievable. However, there are some practical challenges: accurately estimating mutual information in high-dimensional spaces is notoriously difficult; collecting sufficient human feedback for training could be resource-intensive; and the optimization of multiple layers with conditional mutual information terms may face convergence issues. These challenges don't render the idea infeasible, but they do require careful consideration and potentially significant computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in AI alignment: creating systems that can effectively communicate and collaborate with humans by focusing on human-relevant features. If successful, this approach could significantly advance human-AI cooperation by providing a principled, information-theoretic framework for alignment. The potential impact extends beyond the specific tasks mentioned to broader applications in human-AI interaction. The approach could lead to more interpretable AI systems, which is crucial for trust and adoption. The information-theoretic framing also provides theoretical grounding that could inspire further research in this direction. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of human-AI collaboration and the current limitations in alignment techniques."
