    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding when, how, and why neural models learn similar representations, with a specific application to model merging across different architectures. The proposal's emphasis on task-conditioned functional alignment is consistent with the original idea, and the methodology incorporates techniques like Optimal Transport and CCA that were mentioned in the research idea. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by addressing representation alignment challenges identified in the papers, particularly the work on stitching properties and kernel alignment (Insulla et al.) and the formation of canonical representations (Ziyin et al.). The proposal thoroughly addresses all key aspects of the task, with no significant inconsistencies or gaps."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined, and the technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design section provides specific datasets, architectures, baselines, and evaluation metrics, making the implementation plan concrete and understandable. The only minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more explicit connections between the theoretical foundations and practical implementations, and (2) slightly more detail on how the task conditions are specifically defined and selected. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its approach to cross-architecture model merging. The key innovation lies in the task-conditioned functional alignment framework, which focuses on activation-space alignment rather than direct parameter interpolation. This approach differs from conventional methods by conditioning the alignment on specific task properties and using techniques from Optimal Transport and CCA to find minimal transformations. While individual components like OT, CCA, and model stitching exist in prior work, their combination and application to the specific problem of cross-architecture merging represents a fresh perspective. However, the proposal builds incrementally on existing alignment and stitching techniques rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for Optimal Transport-based alignment and CCA-based subspace alignment are correctly presented and well-justified. The methodology logically progresses from data collection to alignment computation to stitching layer construction, with appropriate evaluation metrics like CKA similarity to validate the approach. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and ablation studies to isolate the effects of different components. The only minor limitations in soundness are: (1) limited discussion of potential failure modes or theoretical limitations of the approach, and (2) the assumption that functional alignment is always possible between different architectures, which may not hold in all cases. Overall, the technical approach is robust and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and methods. The datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet subset) and model architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, VGG, ViT) are standard and readily available. The computational techniques (OT, CCA) have established implementations. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and measurable. However, there are some implementation challenges that affect the feasibility score: (1) computing optimal transport for high-dimensional activation spaces may be computationally expensive, (2) finding the right balance of hyperparameters (rank in CCA, regularization in OT) could require extensive tuning, and (3) the effectiveness of the lightweight stitching layers might vary significantly across architecture pairs. While these challenges don't make the proposal impractical, they do introduce moderate complexity that would require careful implementation and possibly additional computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in deep learning: efficient reuse and merging of pre-trained models with different architectures. If successful, TCFA could have substantial impact in several ways: (1) reducing computational resources needed for model adaptation and transfer, (2) enabling more modular deep learning pipelines where components can be mixed and matched, (3) providing theoretical insights into representation alignment across architectures, and (4) potentially informing neuroscience research on canonical representations. The practical benefits of resource efficiency and model modularity are particularly significant given the increasing size and computational cost of state-of-the-art models. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and connects them to broader implications in model versioning, continual learning, and federated learning. While the impact would be meaningful, it might be somewhat limited to specific technical communities rather than transforming the entire field, which prevents it from receiving the highest significance score."
