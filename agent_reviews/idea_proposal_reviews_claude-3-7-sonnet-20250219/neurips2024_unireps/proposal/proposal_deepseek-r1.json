    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding when, how, and why neural models learn similar representations, with a specific application to model merging across architectures. The Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment (TCFA) framework is consistent with the original idea of aligning activation spaces based on functional similarity. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including representation alignment (paper 1), the Canonical Representation Hypothesis (paper 2), hierarchical alignment (paper 3), and the relationship between data distribution and model structure (paper 4). The methodology clearly builds upon these foundations while addressing the identified challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-phase approach (probing, alignment, and stitching) is logically presented with appropriate technical details. Mathematical formulations are provided for key concepts like CKA and optimal transport alignment. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for generating task-conditioned input variations could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the optimal transport approach and CCA-based methods could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the stitching layer training could be more specific."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing the concept of task-conditioning for functional alignment across architectures. While representation alignment and model merging are established research areas, the TCFA approach offers a fresh perspective by focusing on task-specific input variations to guide the alignment process. The integration of optimal transport with representation similarity metrics for cross-architecture alignment is innovative. The proposal also extends existing work on model stitching and the Canonical Representation Hypothesis to cross-architecture settings. However, some components build directly on existing techniques (CKA, optimal transport, stitching layers), and the overall framework combines these known methods in a novel way rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks. The mathematical formulations for CKA and optimal transport are correctly presented. The three-phase methodology is logically structured and builds upon solid foundations in representation learning and alignment. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The connection to the Canonical Representation Hypothesis provides theoretical grounding. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, such as architectural disparities and task distribution variability. The only minor concerns are: (1) the exact optimization procedure for the transport plan could be more detailed, and (2) the theoretical guarantees for the alignment process could be more rigorously established."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, LAION-5B) and model architectures (ResNet, ViT, BERT, etc.) are widely available. The three-phase methodology can be implemented using existing tools and frameworks. The evaluation metrics are measurable and appropriate. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) aligning representations across dramatically different architectures (e.g., vision vs. language models) may be more challenging than anticipated, (2) the computational requirements for optimal transport on large-scale models could be substantial, and (3) the expected outcome of merging ResNet and ViT with <10% accuracy drop may be ambitious given the architectural differences. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed timeline and resource allocation plan."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem with significant potential impact. Successfully merging models across architectures could substantially reduce computational costs and carbon footprint in AI development. The approach could enable more efficient reuse of pre-trained models, facilitate federated learning across heterogeneous devices, and improve multi-modal systems. The theoretical contributions to understanding representation alignment have broader implications for neuroscience and cognitive science. The practical applications in modular AI systems, federated learning, and model interpretability are well-articulated. The proposal also contributes to the workshop's goal of understanding when and why neural models learn similar representations. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on supervised learning scenarios and the potential challenges in scaling to very large models."
