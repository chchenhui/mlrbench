    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding why and how neural models learn similar representations, and proposes a concrete method (TCFA) for leveraging this understanding to merge models with different architectures. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, such as representation alignment, the relationship between data distribution and model structure (from the AI alignment paper), and the notion of canonical representations. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed TCFA technique will probe models using task-specific variations and apply optimal transport or subspace alignment methods, which aligns perfectly with the original research idea. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions specific techniques like SARA's hierarchical alignment framework, the proposal doesn't explicitly incorporate these specific approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated and structured logically. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are clearly defined. The algorithmic steps are presented in a systematic manner, with mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The evaluation metrics are well-specified, covering functional similarity, task performance, computational efficiency, and generalization. The introduction effectively contextualizes the research within the broader field, and the significance section clearly articulates the potential impact. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the learned transformations into a single cohesive model could be more detailed, (2) the specific task conditions to be used for alignment could be more concretely defined, and (3) the relationship between the proposed TCFA technique and existing alignment methods mentioned in the literature review could be more explicitly articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to model merging through task-conditioned functional alignment. While representation alignment and model merging are not new concepts, the specific focus on conditioning alignment based on task properties and using this to bridge architectural differences is innovative. The use of Optimal Transport or subspace alignment methods for finding minimal transformations between activation manifolds adds a fresh perspective to the model merging problem. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that the core techniques (Optimal Transport, CCA variants) are established methods being applied to a new context rather than fundamentally new algorithms. Additionally, while the task-conditioning aspect is novel, the proposal could more clearly differentiate its approach from existing work in representation alignment and model merging to strengthen its claim to originality."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks. The methodology is rigorous, with clear algorithmic steps and mathematical formulations. The approach of probing models with task-specific variations and using sophisticated alignment techniques is well-justified based on the literature. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The research design follows a logical progression from model selection to alignment to integration. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges in merging models with different architectures and task distributions, demonstrating awareness of potential pitfalls. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) more detailed justification for why task-conditioning specifically would overcome architectural disparities, (2) clearer explanation of how the method would handle very different architectures (e.g., transformers vs. CNNs), and (3) more discussion of potential failure modes and how they would be addressed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and evaluation metrics. The methods proposed (Optimal Transport, CCA variants) are established techniques with available implementations, making the technical aspects of the research achievable. The data collection process is reasonable, involving pre-trained models and task-specific datasets. However, there are several challenges that might affect feasibility: (1) aligning models with vastly different architectures might prove more difficult than anticipated, (2) the computational resources required for probing models with numerous task-specific variations could be substantial, (3) finding the right balance between alignment precision and the lightweight nature of the stitching layers might be challenging, and (4) the proposal doesn't specify the scale of models to be merged, which could significantly impact feasibility if very large models are involved. Despite these challenges, the research appears generally implementable with current technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in the field of neural networks with significant potential impact. Efficient model merging across different architectures could lead to substantial computational savings and enable new applications in transfer learning and multi-modal AI. The research contributes to the theoretical understanding of representation learning and the invariances that emerge naturally in neural models, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus. The cross-disciplinary nature of the work, bridging machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science, enhances its significance. The practical applications in model merging, multi-modal scenarios, and AI alignment are well-articulated and compelling. The proposal also contributes to the development of a robust mathematical science of AI alignment, as highlighted in the literature review. However, the significance could be further enhanced by more explicitly discussing how the findings might generalize beyond model merging to other areas of representation learning and neural network theory."
