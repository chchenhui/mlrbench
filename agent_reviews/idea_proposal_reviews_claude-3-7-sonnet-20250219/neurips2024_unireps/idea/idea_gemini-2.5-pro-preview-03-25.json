        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on understanding when and how different neural models learn similar representations. The proposed Task-Conditioned Functional Alignment (TCFA) technique directly addresses the workshop's central question about representation similarity across models with different architectures. The idea specifically targets the practical application of model merging mentioned in the task description and explores the conditions under which representations functionally align despite architectural differences. The approach of using task-specific conditions to guide alignment is highly relevant to the workshop's goal of understanding 'the underlying reasons, mechanisms, and extent of similarity in internal representations across distinct neural models.'"

        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and clearly defined. The motivation, main concept, and proposed methodology are all presented in a logical and comprehensible manner. The explanation of using Optimal Transport or subspace alignment methods to find transformations that align activation manifolds is specific enough to understand the technical approach. However, there could be more detail on exactly how the 'task-specific input variations' would be defined and generated across different domains, and how the method would quantitatively determine when functional alignment has been achieved. The concept of 'stitching' layers could also benefit from more concrete examples of how they would be implemented in practice."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel approach by focusing on task-conditioned functional alignment rather than direct parameter space alignment, which is a fresh perspective in model merging. While model merging itself is not new, the specific focus on conditioning the alignment based on task properties and using this to enable cross-architecture merging represents an innovative direction. The concept of using lightweight 'stitching' layers based on functional similarity rather than architectural similarity is particularly original. The approach builds upon existing techniques (Optimal Transport, CCA) but applies them in a new context and for a different purpose than they are typically used, showing creative recombination of existing methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears largely feasible with current technology and methods. The proposed techniques (Optimal Transport, CCA variants) are established and have implementations available. The concept of probing different layers and finding transformations between activation spaces is technically achievable. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) defining appropriate task-specific input variations across diverse domains may require significant domain expertise, (2) finding meaningful alignments between very different architectures might be difficult in practice, and (3) ensuring that the merged models maintain performance across the full task distribution (not just the conditions used for alignment) could be challenging. The approach would likely require considerable experimentation to determine optimal alignment strategies for different types of architectures."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a significant problem in the field of neural network research. Effective model merging across different architectures could dramatically reduce computational resources needed for training large models and enable more efficient knowledge transfer. The approach could provide valuable insights into representation similarity across different neural architectures, contributing to the theoretical understanding of neural networks. If successful, this work could have broad impact across multiple domains by enabling practitioners to combine specialized models into more general ones without full retraining. The research directly contributes to the workshop's goal of understanding and unifying representations across neural models, potentially leading to practical applications in model compression, transfer learning, and multi-task learning."
