        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on unifying representations across neural models. It directly addresses the core question of 'when, how and why different neural models learn the same representations' by proposing a contrastive learning framework to align representations from diverse architectures. The proposal specifically targets model merging, stitching, and reuse - all explicitly mentioned in the workshop description. The idea also connects to the workshop's interest in identifying invariances that emerge from learning models and finding ways to enforce them, which is precisely what the contrastive invariant learning approach aims to do. The only minor gap is that while the workshop mentions neuroscience connections, the proposal is primarily focused on artificial neural networks without explicit biological parallels."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a specific problem (aligning latent spaces across different neural architectures), a proposed solution (contrastive learning framework with an alignment module), and expected outcomes (improved model stitching and interoperability). The methodology is well-defined, mentioning contrastive loss, data augmentations, and multi-task objectives. The evaluation approach is also clearly specified through model stitching success rates and transfer learning performance. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific design of the alignment module, how exactly the contrastive loss would be formulated for cross-architecture settings, and what specific data augmentations would be most effective for ensuring invariance across different model types."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to cross-model representation alignment. While contrastive learning itself is well-established, applying it specifically to align representations across different neural architectures (CNNs, transformers) represents a fresh application. The integration of data augmentations and multi-task objectives to ensure invariance across architectural differences adds an innovative dimension. However, similar concepts have been explored in transfer learning, multi-modal learning, and knowledge distillation literature, though perhaps not with the specific focus on creating a unified latent space across diverse architectures. The proposal builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new learning paradigms, which somewhat limits its novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. Contrastive learning frameworks are well-established, with numerous implementations available. The proposed evaluation metrics (model stitching success and transfer learning performance) are concrete and measurable. The required components - different model architectures, datasets for training, and contrastive learning implementations - are all readily available. The main implementation challenges would likely involve designing effective alignment modules that work across very different architectures and finding the right balance of augmentations and objectives to ensure meaningful invariance. These challenges appear surmountable with current techniques and computational resources, though they may require significant experimentation to optimize."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important problem with potentially broad impact. Successfully aligning representations across different neural architectures could significantly advance model interoperability, reuse, and composition - addressing a genuine pain point in practical AI deployment. The democratization of access to pre-trained models through simplified integration has substantial practical value for the AI community. The work could also provide theoretical insights into representation learning and invariances across architectures. The significance extends to applications in multi-modal AI and federated learning as mentioned. However, the impact might be somewhat limited by how well the approach generalizes across very different architectures and domains, and whether the aligned representations maintain sufficient task-specific information to be truly useful in downstream applications."
