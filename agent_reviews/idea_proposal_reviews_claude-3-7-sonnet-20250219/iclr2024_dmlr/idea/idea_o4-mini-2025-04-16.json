        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses model-assisted dataset construction, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The proposal focuses on data quality, curation processes, and efficient dataset construction for foundation models across multiple domains, which are central themes of the workshop. The idea also touches on several other relevant topics including quality signals (uncertainty metrics), handling unlabeled data, and human-computer interaction aspects of data curation. The only minor limitation is that while it mentions ethical considerations implicitly (through better curation), it doesn't explicitly address data governance or ethical frameworks."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The four-step pipeline (ensemble scoring, clustering and routing, retraining, and updating) is well-articulated and follows a logical progression. The use of uncertainty metrics and inter-model disagreement as quality signals is clearly defined. The multi-armed bandit approach for balancing exploration and exploitation is a precise algorithmic choice. However, some implementation details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific clustering methods to be used, how the interactive interface would function, and the exact mechanisms for measuring uncertainty across different domains. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. The use of uncertainty and disagreement metrics to guide human annotation is not entirely new, but applying it systematically across multiple domains for foundation model training is innovative. The multi-armed bandit formulation for balancing domain exploration and difficult sample exploitation represents a novel approach to the curation problem. However, many of the individual components (model ensembles, active learning, human-in-the-loop systems) have been explored in various contexts before. The innovation lies more in the integration and application to multi-domain foundation models rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is highly feasible with current technology and methods. All the components—ensemble models, uncertainty estimation, clustering algorithms, and interactive interfaces—are well-established techniques. The iterative nature of the pipeline allows for incremental implementation and testing. The multi-armed bandit allocation strategy has solid theoretical foundations and practical implementations. The main implementation challenges would likely come from scaling the system to truly diverse domains and designing effective interfaces for human curators, but these are manageable engineering tasks rather than fundamental obstacles. The 30-50% reduction in annotation costs is an ambitious but potentially achievable goal based on prior active learning literature."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical bottleneck in foundation model development: the cost and quality of large-scale datasets across diverse domains. If successful, it could significantly accelerate the development of foundation models for new domains beyond vision and language, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals. The potential 30-50% reduction in annotation costs would have substantial practical impact for both academic and industrial research. The approach could also lead to higher-quality datasets with better domain coverage, potentially improving model robustness and reducing biases. The significance is particularly high given the current shift toward data-centric AI and the recognized importance of dataset quality for foundation model performance."
