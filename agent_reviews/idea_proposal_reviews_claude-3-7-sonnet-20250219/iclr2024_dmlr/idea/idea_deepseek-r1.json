    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description. It directly addresses model-assisted dataset construction, quality signals for datasets, dataset drift, and ethical considerations - all explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal focuses on data-centric approaches for foundation models in specialized domains beyond language and vision (healthcare, climate science), which is a core aim of the workshop. The idea incorporates human-in-the-loop curation (HCI aspect) and proposes quality metrics, perfectly matching the workshop's focus on data quality, diversity, and provenance. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly mention benchmarks like DataPerf or DataComp, though it does propose comparative experiments."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. It clearly articulates the motivation, main components of the framework (FM-based labeling, active curation loop, temporal integration), and evaluation approach. The concept of using foundation models to assist in dataset curation is well-defined, and the iterative process involving human experts is logically presented. The dynamic quality metric combining semantic coherence, diversity, and fairness is mentioned, though it could benefit from slightly more elaboration on how these metrics would be quantified. Overall, the proposal communicates a comprehensive and understandable research direction with only minor ambiguities around the specific implementation details of the quality metrics."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. While foundation models and active learning are established techniques, their integration for dynamic dataset curation in specialized domains represents an innovative approach. The incorporation of temporal signals to address dataset drift and the proposed dynamic quality metric that includes ethical fairness are particularly novel aspects. However, the core techniques (foundation models for labeling, active learning for expert queries) build upon well-established methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms. The novelty lies more in the holistic framework and application to specialized domains than in revolutionary new techniques."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and resources. It leverages existing foundation models and active learning techniques, making implementation straightforward. The proposed experiments on biomedical and environmental datasets are realistic and achievable. The human-in-the-loop component may require careful design of expert interfaces and incentive structures, but this is manageable. The dynamic quality metric might present some implementation challenges, particularly in quantifying ethical fairness across diverse domains, but these are not insurmountable. The iterative nature of the framework also allows for incremental development and testing, enhancing feasibility. Overall, the approach could be implemented with current technologies and methodologies with reasonable effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical gap in current ML practice - the creation and maintenance of high-quality datasets for specialized domains where data is often fragmented, unlabeled, or rapidly evolving. The potential impact is substantial, as it could democratize access to high-quality datasets beyond tech-centric domains, enabling robust foundation models for healthcare, climate science, and other critical areas. The emphasis on embedding governance protocols for transparency and bias mitigation further enhances its significance by addressing ethical concerns in dataset creation. If successful, this approach could substantially accelerate the development of reliable AI systems in domains where they could have transformative societal benefits, while maintaining ethical standards."
