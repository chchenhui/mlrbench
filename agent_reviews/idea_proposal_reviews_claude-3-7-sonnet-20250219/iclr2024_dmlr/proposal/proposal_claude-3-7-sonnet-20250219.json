    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric approaches for foundation models in new domains beyond language and vision. The UMC framework specifically tackles model-assisted dataset construction, quality signals, and ethical considerations—all explicitly mentioned in the task description. The proposal faithfully expands on the initial idea, maintaining the core concepts of uncertainty-driven curation, ensemble models, clustering of uncertain samples, and multi-armed bandit allocation. It thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, particularly building on Zha et al.'s (2023) work on data-centric AI and addressing challenges identified in the review such as data quality, efficient curation, uncertainty estimation, and balancing exploration/exploitation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. Key concepts are defined precisely, and the technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The UMC framework components are thoroughly described, including uncertainty estimation, sample clustering, multi-armed bandit allocation, and the interactive curation interface. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive and well-specified. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the interactive curation interface could be more concrete, (2) some technical parameters (like α in the uncertainty formula) would benefit from more discussion on how they're determined, and (3) the relationship between the clustering approach and the multi-armed bandit allocation could be more explicitly connected."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing techniques in a novel way. The integration of ensemble-based uncertainty estimation, clustering for batch annotation, multi-armed bandit allocation across domains, and an interactive human-in-the-loop interface represents a fresh approach to dataset curation. The uncertainty estimation that combines predictive confidence with inter-model disagreement is particularly innovative. However, many of the individual components (active learning, uncertainty sampling, multi-armed bandits) are established techniques in the literature. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally transforms these approaches. While the combination is novel, especially in the context of multi-domain foundation models, it builds incrementally on existing methods rather than introducing entirely new paradigms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for uncertainty estimation, clustering, and multi-armed bandit allocation are well-defined and theoretically sound. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, with appropriate metrics and experimental designs to validate the approach. The three-phase experimental design (controlled simulations, medium-scale evaluation, large-scale deployment) provides a robust framework for validating the claims. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations. The technical approach draws appropriately from established methods in active learning, uncertainty quantification, and human-in-the-loop systems. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification, such as the specific form of the uncertainty combination function and the theoretical guarantees for the multi-armed bandit approach in this specific context."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation paths. The UMC framework builds on existing technologies and methods that have been demonstrated individually in the literature. The phased experimental design provides a practical roadmap for implementation and evaluation. The required components—pre-trained models, clustering algorithms, annotation interfaces—are all available with current technology. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) developing an effective interactive curation interface that maximizes annotator efficiency requires significant UX design expertise; (2) coordinating a diverse ensemble of domain-specific models across multiple domains may be computationally expensive; (3) recruiting and managing domain experts for annotation across five diverse domains (biomedical, financial, legal, technical, educational) will require substantial resources and coordination; and (4) the expected 30-50% reduction in annotation costs is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve consistently across all domains."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI research: the efficient construction of high-quality, diverse datasets for foundation models across multiple domains. If successful, the UMC framework could significantly reduce annotation costs while improving dataset quality, which would accelerate the development of foundation models for specialized domains. The expected outcomes—30-50% reduction in annotation costs, 10-15% performance improvements, and 15-20% better cross-domain generalization—would represent meaningful advances in the field. The broader impacts are well-articulated, including democratizing foundation models for underserved domains, improving data governance, promoting sustainable AI development, and enhancing human-AI collaboration. The work aligns strongly with the emerging data-centric paradigm in AI research highlighted in the literature review. The significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the technical innovations, but the practical impact on dataset construction efficiency and quality could be substantial."
