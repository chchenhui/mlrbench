    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric approaches for foundation models, particularly in the areas of model-assisted dataset construction, quality signals, and ethical considerations. The UMC framework incorporates elements from the research idea, including uncertainty-driven curation, ensemble models for scoring unlabeled data, and multi-armed bandits for resource allocation. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by addressing challenges identified in papers like Zha et al. (2023a, 2023b) regarding data quality and curation, and incorporates concepts from Saveliev et al. (2025) on human-guided approaches. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions ethical governance, it could have elaborated more on specific mechanisms for addressing data provenance issues highlighted in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The UMC framework is explained in detail with five distinct stages, each with clear objectives and technical specifications. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented, particularly for uncertainty estimation and the multi-armed bandit allocation. The experimental design section clearly outlines datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. Figures are referenced (though not visible in the provided text), which would enhance understanding. The only areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more details on the implementation of the interactive annotation interface, and (2) further explanation of how the domain affinity score is calculated. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible and provides sufficient detail for implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of ensemble uncertainty quantification with clustering-based sample prioritization and multi-armed bandits for resource allocation represents a fresh approach to dataset curation. The dual consideration of predictive uncertainty and model disagreement for sample selection is particularly innovative. However, many of the individual components (active learning, uncertainty estimation, bandit algorithms) are established techniques in the literature. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches. The interactive annotation interface with model explanations is a valuable contribution, though similar human-in-the-loop systems have been proposed in papers like Saveliev et al. (2025). The proposal's novelty lies primarily in its comprehensive integration of these techniques specifically for multi-domain foundation model development."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The uncertainty estimation approach using ensemble methods and KL divergence is mathematically sound and well-justified. The multi-armed bandit formulation for resource allocation is appropriate for balancing exploration and exploitation. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-chosen baselines and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The proposed Annotation Efficiency Gain (AEG) metric is a thoughtful contribution for measuring cost-effectiveness. The statistical validation plan, including ANOVA tests and ablation studies, demonstrates commitment to rigorous evaluation. One area that could be strengthened is the justification for the specific clustering approach (UMAP + K-means) and how the number of clusters would be determined. Additionally, while the distillation loss for model retraining is mentioned, more details on the optimization procedure would enhance soundness. Overall, the technical approach is well-founded and carefully considered."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation requirements. The use of pre-trained domain specialists as an ensemble is practical, as these models are readily available. The clustering and uncertainty estimation techniques are well-established and implementable with current tools. The multi-armed bandit algorithm for resource allocation is computationally efficient and adaptable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) Creating an effective interactive annotation interface with model explanations for diverse domains will require substantial engineering work; (2) The coordination between the ensemble models, clustering algorithm, and bandit allocator introduces complexity; (3) The computational resources needed for maintaining and retraining multiple models could be substantial. The timeline and resource requirements are not explicitly discussed, which is a limitation. The 30-50% reduction in annotation costs is an ambitious but potentially achievable goal based on prior work in active learning. Overall, the proposal is implementable but would require considerable resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI development: efficient and high-quality dataset curation for multi-domain foundation models. If successful, UMC could significantly reduce annotation costs while improving model robustness and domain coverage, which would be valuable contributions to the field. The approach aligns well with the growing emphasis on data-centric AI highlighted in the literature review. The potential impact extends beyond academic research to practical applications in industry, where annotation costs are a major bottleneck. The focus on underrepresented domains and ethical governance also addresses important societal concerns about AI development. The expected outcomes (30-50% reduction in annotation costs, 20% improvement in ECE, 15% higher domain entropy) are substantial and would represent meaningful progress. The open-source implementation plan enhances the potential impact by making the framework accessible to the broader community. While not completely transformative of the field, the proposal has the potential for significant and wide-ranging impact on how datasets are curated for foundation models."
