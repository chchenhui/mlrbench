    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric approaches for foundation models across multiple domains beyond just language and vision. The UMC framework specifically targets model-assisted dataset construction, quality signals, and ethical considerations—all explicitly mentioned in the task description. The proposal faithfully implements the core idea of uncertainty-driven curation with ensemble models, clustering, and multi-armed bandits as outlined in the research idea. It also thoroughly incorporates the literature, citing relevant works like Zha et al. (2023), Xu et al. (2024), and Najjar et al. (2024) to ground its approach in current research on data-centric AI. The only minor inconsistency is that some citations (e.g., Liu et al., 2025) appear to be from the future, which might be a formatting error."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections for introduction, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly enumerated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate mathematical formulations. The UMC pipeline is visually represented in Figure 1, enhancing understanding of the workflow. Technical concepts like ensemble uncertainty scoring and multi-armed bandits are explained with precise mathematical notation. However, some aspects could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for updating uncertainty estimates after model retraining is not fully detailed, (2) the relationship between the ensemble models and the final foundation model could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., Ward linkage, UMAP) are mentioned without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these techniques."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in its approach to data curation for foundation models. The integration of uncertainty quantification, clustering-based sample selection, and multi-armed bandits for resource allocation represents a fresh combination of existing techniques. The use of both predictive confidence and inter-model disagreement as dual uncertainty signals is a thoughtful innovation. However, many of the individual components (ensemble uncertainty, active learning, MAB allocation) have been explored in prior work, though perhaps not in this specific combination or application context. The interactive annotation interface with visual clustering cues and confidence intervals is interesting but not fully developed as a novel contribution. While the proposal doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithms, it does present a novel framework for addressing an important problem in data-centric AI, with clear distinctions from existing approaches in the literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for uncertainty scoring, disagreement metrics, and the UCB strategy are correctly presented and well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets spanning multiple domains, relevant baselines for comparison, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. The statistical analysis plan with 5×5 cross-validation and Nemenyi tests shows attention to rigorous validation. The approach is grounded in established theoretical frameworks (ensemble learning, active learning, multi-armed bandits) and builds logically on prior work cited in the literature review. The only minor weaknesses are: (1) the choice of α in the composite uncertainty score lacks justification for how it would be determined, (2) the hierarchical clustering approach might need more validation for high-dimensional feature spaces, and (3) some claims about expected performance improvements (e.g., ≥30% fewer annotations) would benefit from preliminary results or stronger theoretical justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods. The core components—ensemble models, uncertainty estimation, clustering, and interactive interfaces—are all implementable with current tools and frameworks. The datasets mentioned (DomainNet, BioASQ, LegalBench, EuroSAT-Geo) are publicly available, making the experimental validation practical. However, there are some implementation challenges that could affect feasibility: (1) training and maintaining multiple domain-specific foundation models requires significant computational resources, (2) the interactive annotation interface with visual clustering cues would require substantial development effort, (3) the human-in-the-loop component introduces logistical complexities for large-scale experiments, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address how domain boundaries would be determined in practice for the multi-armed bandit allocator. While these challenges don't render the approach impractical, they do suggest that considerable refinement and optimization would be needed for successful implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in data-centric AI: efficient curation of high-quality, multi-domain datasets for foundation models. This problem is widely recognized as a bottleneck in the development of robust, generalizable AI systems. The potential impact is substantial across several dimensions: (1) reducing annotation costs by 30-50% would significantly lower barriers to entry for developing domain-specific foundation models, (2) improving robustness to dataset shift addresses a fundamental limitation of current systems, (3) the approach could be applied across diverse domains including healthcare, Earth observation, and legal text analysis, and (4) the contributions to benchmarks like DataPerf would advance community standards for evaluation. The proposal also acknowledges ethical considerations around privacy and computational efficiency. While the impact may not be transformative of the entire field, it represents a significant advancement in data-centric methodologies with clear practical benefits for both research and applications."
