    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric approaches for foundation models in new domains beyond language and vision, specifically targeting climate science, healthcare, and robotics. The proposal fully embraces the concept of model-assisted dataset construction with diversity-aware feedback loops as outlined in the research idea, and incorporates mechanisms to address bias amplification issues highlighted in the literature review. The methodology section comprehensively covers all aspects mentioned in the task description, including data quality signals, construction from uncurated data, and ethical considerations. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions benchmarking, it doesn't specifically reference DataPerf, DynaBench, or DataComp as mentioned in the task description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The system architecture is well-defined with four main components that are thoroughly explained. The experimental design section clearly outlines domains, baselines, evaluation metrics, and protocols. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) Some mathematical notations are introduced without sufficient explanation (e.g., the exact definition of the 'Diverse(B)' function in the batch selection formula); (2) The relationship between the diversity metrics and the feedback loop mechanism could be more explicitly connected; (3) Figure 1 is referenced but not included, which slightly hampers understanding of the system architecture. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several existing concepts into a cohesive framework with novel elements. The core innovation lies in the diversity-aware feedback loops that explicitly target underrepresented regions in the data distribution, which goes beyond traditional model-assisted curation approaches. The counter-bias generation technique and the structured feedback collection mechanism are particularly innovative aspects. However, many of the individual components (active learning, synthetic data generation, latent space clustering) build upon well-established methods in the literature. The proposal acknowledges this by citing relevant prior work on feedback loops and bias amplification. While the integration of these components into a unified framework for dataset construction is valuable, the fundamental techniques themselves are not entirely groundbreaking. The approach represents a meaningful advancement rather than a paradigm shift in dataset construction methodology."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for diversity assessment, synthetic data generation, and active learning are well-defined and appropriate for the stated objectives. The use of latent space clustering, density estimation, and entropy-based diversity scoring is technically sound and well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes mechanisms to address them, such as the counter-bias generation to mitigate bias amplification. However, there are a few areas where additional theoretical justification would strengthen the approach: (1) The convergence properties of the iterative refinement process are not fully analyzed; (2) The theoretical guarantees for the diversity metrics could be more rigorously established; (3) The interaction between synthetic data generation and human validation could benefit from more formal analysis to ensure quality control. Despite these minor limitations, the overall technical approach is well-founded and rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined components that can be implemented using existing technologies and methods. The modular design allows for incremental development and testing, and the experimental protocol is realistic and well-structured. The use of human validation is practical and the active learning approach helps manage the annotation burden. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) The computational resources required for training foundation models across multiple iterations could be substantial, especially for domains like climate science and biomedical imaging; (2) The quality of synthetic data generation depends heavily on the initial seed dataset, which might be limited in emerging domains; (3) Coordinating human validators with domain expertise across multiple fields (climate science, healthcare, robotics) could be logistically challenging and expensive; (4) The proposed 30-50% reduction in annotation costs is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve consistently across all domains. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent significant hurdles that would require careful planning and resource allocation to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in machine learning: creating high-quality, diverse datasets for training foundation models in emerging domains. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions. First, the methodological contribution of making diversity and representativeness explicit objectives in dataset construction could influence standard practices in the field. Second, the practical impact of reducing annotation costs while improving dataset quality could democratize access to foundation models for resource-constrained applications. Third, the explicit focus on bias identification and mitigation promotes fairness and ethical AI development. The proposal targets important domains with significant societal impact (climate science, healthcare, robotics), and the expected improvements in model performance for underrepresented cases (15-25%) and robustness to distribution shifts (10-20%) would represent meaningful advances. The modular nature of the framework enables cross-domain transfer, potentially accelerating the application of foundation models beyond current focus areas. While the approach may not completely revolutionize dataset construction, it represents a significant step forward in addressing a fundamental limitation in current approaches to model training."
