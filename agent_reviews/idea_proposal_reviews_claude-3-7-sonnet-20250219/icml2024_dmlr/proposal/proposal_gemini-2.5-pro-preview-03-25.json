        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric approaches for foundation models, particularly in the areas of model-assisted dataset construction, quality signals, and ethical considerations. The proposal expands on the initial idea of diversity-aware feedback loops by providing a comprehensive framework (ADDE) with detailed methodology. It incorporates insights from the literature review, specifically addressing the challenges of bias amplification in feedback loops (Wyllie et al., 2024; Taori & Hashimoto, 2022), fairness-aware data augmentation (Erfanian et al., 2024), and integration of diverse feedback (Yu et al., 2023). The proposal maintains consistency with the original idea while providing substantial elaboration on the technical approach, evaluation methodology, and expected outcomes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the context, problem statement, and significance of the research. The methodology section provides a detailed algorithmic framework with formal notation, clearly defining each component of the ADDE approach. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying domains, datasets, baseline methods, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes are explicitly stated with quantifiable targets. The only minor areas that could benefit from further clarification are: (1) some technical details about the implementation of the diversity metrics and their optimization, (2) more specific information about the human validation interface and workflow, and (3) clearer distinction between the roles of synthetic versus real data in some parts of the methodology. Overall, the proposal is highly readable and logically organized, making the complex approach accessible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents significant novelty in several aspects. The ADDE framework introduces a novel integration of diversity analysis, targeted data acquisition, and active learning within an adaptive feedback loop specifically designed for dataset construction. While individual components (active learning, synthetic data generation, diversity metrics) exist in prior work, their combination into a cohesive, iterative framework with explicit diversity targeting represents a fresh approach. The proposal's focus on identifying and filling underrepresented regions in the latent space is particularly innovative. The framework also introduces novel diversity metrics for dataset evaluation and a unique approach to mitigating bias amplification in model-data feedback loops. The proposal builds upon existing literature (cited appropriately) but extends it in meaningful ways, particularly in how it transforms potential negative feedback loops into constructive ones that enhance diversity. The approach is not entirely groundbreaking, as it leverages established techniques, but the novel combination and application to the specific problem of dataset construction for foundation models in specialized domains represents a valuable contribution to the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness overall. The methodology is well-grounded in established machine learning techniques and builds logically on prior work in active learning, generative modeling, and diversity metrics. The algorithmic framework is formally defined with appropriate mathematical notation, and the experimental design includes relevant baselines and evaluation metrics. The diversity analysis approach using latent space clustering is theoretically justified, and the active learning strategy is formulated as a principled multi-objective optimization. However, there are some areas where the technical foundations could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical guarantees or convergence properties of the iterative process are not fully addressed, (2) the potential interactions between synthetic data generation and model bias are acknowledged but lack rigorous analysis, and (3) some of the proposed diversity metrics would benefit from more formal definition and validation. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, which adds to its credibility, but could provide more detailed mitigation strategies for some technical risks (e.g., mode collapse in generative models, stability of the feedback loop)."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with reasonable scope and implementation path. The methodology leverages existing technologies (foundation models, clustering algorithms, active learning) that are well-established and accessible. The experimental domains (biomedical imaging, climate informatics) are appropriate and have available datasets that could be adapted for the proposed experiments. The evaluation metrics are measurable and relevant to the research objectives. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the computational resources required for multiple iterations of foundation model training could be substantial, (2) the human annotation component, while essential, introduces logistical challenges in terms of recruiting qualified annotators and designing effective interfaces, (3) the integration of multiple complex components (diversity analysis, generative models, active learning) may introduce implementation challenges and potential points of failure. The proposal would benefit from more explicit discussion of resource requirements, timeline considerations, and potential fallback strategies if certain components prove more challenging than anticipated. Overall, the research is implementable but ambitious, requiring careful project management and potentially significant computational and human resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in modern machine learning: the efficient construction of high-quality, diverse datasets for foundation models in specialized domains. This is a significant problem with broad implications for the field. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) Scientific impact through advancing data-centric AI methodologies and understanding of model-data feedback dynamics, (2) Practical impact by reducing annotation costs by 30-50% and enabling foundation model application in resource-constrained domains, (3) Ethical impact by explicitly addressing bias and fairness in dataset construction. The proposal directly aligns with current research priorities in responsible AI and data-centric machine learning. If successful, ADDE could become a standard methodology for dataset construction in specialized domains, potentially transforming how researchers approach data curation for foundation models. The significance is further enhanced by the focus on critical application areas like biomedical imaging and climate informatics, where improved models could have substantial societal benefits. The proposal convincingly articulates both the immediate contributions to the research community and the broader long-term impact on AI development and application."
