    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks' by proposing an Adaptive Inference Planner (AIP) that dynamically allocates computational resources during LLM planning. The proposal builds upon the literature review, citing works like AdaPlanner, LLM-DP, AdaLLaVA, and LLM-RAO while addressing the identified gap of a unified framework for adaptive resource allocation in LLM planning. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed approach will implement the core idea of dynamic resource allocation based on difficulty assessment, which was the central concept in the research idea. The proposal also addresses other workshop topics like training methodologies (through the RL-based Policy Learner) and benchmarking (through the evaluation framework)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is presented in a logical flow with distinct components (Difficulty Estimator, Resource Allocator, Policy Learner). The algorithmic details are presented with mathematical formulations that enhance understanding. The experimental design outlines clear baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for how the base LLM interacts with the meta-controller could be more detailed, (2) the training pipeline could elaborate more on how the simulated environment works, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'hidden states') are used without sufficient explanation for readers less familiar with LLM architecture."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a comprehensive framework for adaptive inference in LLM planning. While individual components like meta-reasoning and resource allocation have been explored in prior work (as evidenced in the literature review), the integration of these components into a unified framework with a specific focus on planning tasks represents a fresh perspective. The Difficulty Estimator's use of LLM hidden states to quantify sub-step complexity and the Resource Allocator's mapping to discrete computational actions offer novel contributions. However, the approach shares similarities with existing adaptive computation frameworks like AdaLLaVA and meta-reasoning components mentioned in the literature review. The novelty lies more in the specific application to planning tasks and the integration of components rather than in fundamentally new algorithmic innovations."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods. The mathematical formulations for the Difficulty Estimator and Resource Allocator are clearly presented and theoretically valid. The use of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for training the Policy Learner is appropriate given the reinforcement learning context. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to assess the impact of individual components. The multi-stage training pipeline (pre-training DE, training RA+PL with PPO, fine-tuning end-to-end) is methodologically sound. However, there could be more justification for the specific choice of reward function and how the balance parameter Î» would be determined. Additionally, while the proposal mentions using the LLM's hidden states, it doesn't fully address potential challenges in accessing these states in black-box LLM APIs."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of established benchmarks (ALFWorld, MiniWoB++, Meta-World) and algorithms (PPO) increases feasibility. The three-component architecture (DE, RA, PL) is modular and could be implemented incrementally. However, several aspects may require significant effort: (1) accessing and utilizing LLM hidden states may be challenging, especially with closed-source models, (2) creating a simulated environment for RL training that accurately reflects real-world planning scenarios could be complex, (3) the computational resources required for end-to-end training might be substantial, and (4) the expected 40% speed improvement and 30% accuracy improvement are ambitious targets that may require extensive optimization. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of potential implementation challenges and mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in LLM planning: the inefficient allocation of computational resources during inference. If successful, the AIP framework could significantly impact both research and practical applications of LLMs in planning tasks. The potential 40% reduction in inference costs for simple tasks and 30% improvement in accuracy for complex tasks would represent meaningful advances in LLM efficiency and effectiveness. The framework's potential to generalize across domains (robotics, logistics, code generation) further enhances its significance. The proposal also contributes to the broader research community through its open-source dataset and metrics for evaluating efficient planning. The societal impacts related to industry applications, energy efficiency, and ethical considerations are well-articulated. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on planning tasks specifically, rather than addressing LLM reasoning more broadly, but this focused approach also allows for deeper impact in the targeted domain."
