    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the workshop's focus on reasoning and planning for LLMs. It specifically addresses the 'Inference Time Scaling for Complex Reasoning Tasks' topic by proposing an uncertainty-guided adaptive inference approach that dynamically allocates computational resources. The idea also touches on benchmarking (using GSM8K, HotpotQA) and extends to multi-modal planning, which are explicit topics in the workshop. The proposal directly addresses the question of 'How can models dynamically allocate resources during inference to optimize for reasoning and planning?' mentioned in the workshop description. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly discuss human-in-the-loop systems or explainability aspects."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (high latency and resource costs in LLM reasoning), proposes a specific solution (two-tiered inference with uncertainty estimation), and outlines the expected outcomes (2-5× speedups with ≤2% accuracy loss). The mechanics of the approach are well-defined, explaining how the lightweight estimator triggers full-scale inference when needed. The only minor ambiguities are in the details of how the uncertainty estimator would be implemented and trained, and how exactly the reinforcement learning gating policy would be optimized. These technical details would benefit from further elaboration, but the core concept is very well articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining several existing concepts in a fresh way. Adaptive computation and uncertainty estimation in neural networks aren't new, but applying them specifically to LLM reasoning in a two-tiered approach with RL-based gating is innovative. The integration of uncertainty estimation with chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically switch between lightweight and full models represents a novel approach to the efficiency-accuracy tradeoff in LLM inference. While individual components (uncertainty estimation, model distillation, adaptive computation) exist in the literature, their combination for reasoning-specific LLM inference appears to be a meaningful innovation. It's not completely groundbreaking, as it builds on established techniques, but offers a valuable new perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. The two-tiered approach leverages existing LLM architectures and established techniques in uncertainty estimation and reinforcement learning. The proposed speedup (2-5×) with minimal accuracy loss (≤2%) seems realistic based on similar adaptive computation approaches in other domains. Implementation challenges exist: training an accurate uncertainty estimator for reasoning steps could be difficult, and the RL policy for compute allocation would require careful design and extensive tuning. The extension to multi-modal planning adds complexity but remains within reach of current capabilities. The approach would require significant engineering and computational resources to implement and validate, but there are no fundamental technical barriers that would prevent its realization."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical bottleneck in deploying LLMs for complex reasoning tasks: the high computational cost and latency. The significance is high because efficient inference is essential for real-world applications of LLM reasoning, especially in time-sensitive or resource-constrained environments. If successful, the 2-5× speedup would substantially improve the practicality of LLM reasoning for interactive agents, mobile applications, and time-critical decision support systems. The approach could become a standard technique for deploying reasoning-heavy LLM applications, similar to how quantization and distillation have become standard for general LLM deployment. The impact extends beyond academic interest to practical deployment considerations that could accelerate the adoption of LLM reasoning capabilities across industries."
