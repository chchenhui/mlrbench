        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the workshop's focus on time series in the age of large models. It specifically addresses the 'Analysis of Pretrained Time Series Models' topic by proposing methods to enhance interpretability of these models. The idea also touches on real-world applications by aiming to make these models more trustworthy for critical applications. However, it doesn't explicitly address some other workshop topics like multimodal integration or benchmarking, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear motivation, main approach, and expected outcomes. The hybrid approach combining pretrained models with explainable AI techniques is defined, and specific interpretability methods (attention mechanisms, feature importance, counterfactual explanations) are mentioned. However, the idea could benefit from more specificity about the exact implementation details, evaluation metrics for interpretability, and concrete examples of the critical applications being targeted. The methodology is described at a high level but lacks technical depth on how the interpretability framework would be constructed."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing concepts (pretrained time series models and explainable AI techniques) in a potentially useful way. While interpretability for deep learning models is not new, applying these techniques specifically to pretrained time series models represents a somewhat novel direction. However, many of the mentioned techniques (attention mechanisms, feature importance, counterfactual explanations) are established methods in the XAI field. The proposal doesn't clearly articulate what makes this interpretability framework fundamentally different from existing approaches beyond applying them to time series data. A truly novel contribution would require more innovative interpretability methods specifically designed for the unique challenges of time series data."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears quite feasible with current technology and methods. Pretrained time series models exist, as do various explainable AI techniques that could be adapted to work with them. The proposal builds on established methods rather than requiring entirely new technological breakthroughs. Implementation would likely require significant engineering effort but doesn't face fundamental technical barriers. The main challenge would be developing interpretability methods that work effectively with the sequential nature of time series data while maintaining the performance benefits of pretrained models. The research team would need expertise in both time series analysis and explainable AI, but this combination is achievable."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Enhancing the interpretability of pretrained time series models addresses an important challenge in the field. As noted in the workshop description, the black-box nature of these models is a significant limitation compared to traditional statistical approaches. Improving interpretability could indeed increase trust and adoption in critical applications where understanding model decisions is essential. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the proposal doesn't clearly demonstrate how the interpretability methods would overcome the unique challenges of time series data (temporal dependencies, variable lengths, etc.) beyond general XAI approaches. The potential impact would be stronger if the proposal included specific use cases where improved interpretability would enable new applications or significantly outperform existing approaches."
