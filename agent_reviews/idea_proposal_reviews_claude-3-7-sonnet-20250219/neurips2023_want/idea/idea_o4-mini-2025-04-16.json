        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The MetaSched idea aligns excellently with the WANT workshop's focus on computational efficiency, scalability, and resource optimization for neural network training. It directly addresses key topics listed in the call including scheduling for AI, model/tensor parallelism, pipelining, communication optimization, re-materialization (activation checkpointing), and network/architecture-aware resource allocation. The proposal specifically targets the workshop's goal of democratizing efficient large-scale training for diverse research teams, including those with limited resources. The only minor gap is that while energy efficiency is mentioned as an outcome, it's not the primary focus of the technical approach."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (inefficient scheduling in heterogeneous environments), proposes a specific solution (MetaSched framework using meta-reinforcement learning), and outlines the expected benefits (20-30% training time reduction, 15-25% energy savings). The technical approach involving GNNs to encode the training DAG and resource graph is well-specified. However, some implementation details remain ambiguous, such as how the meta-reinforcement learning would be specifically structured, what reward functions would be used, and how the system would handle dynamic changes in resource availability during training. These minor ambiguities prevent a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines several existing concepts (GNNs, meta-reinforcement learning, scheduling) in a novel way specifically for heterogeneous neural network training environments. While scheduling for distributed training and resource allocation are established research areas, the meta-learning approach to develop transferable scheduling policies across different hardware configurations and model architectures represents a fresh perspective. The integration of computation graph analysis with hardware topology awareness is innovative. However, similar approaches have been explored in related domains like compiler optimization and general distributed systems, which somewhat limits the novelty. The idea extends rather than fundamentally transforms existing paradigms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal faces several implementation challenges. Creating accurate representations of both computation graphs and hardware topologies that generalize well is difficult. Meta-reinforcement learning at this scale would require significant computational resources for training and a diverse dataset of model-hardware configurations. Integration with existing frameworks would demand substantial engineering effort. The claimed 20-30% improvement in training time seems optimistic without preliminary results, as most optimizations in mature systems yield incremental gains. While technically possible with current technology, the complexity of the full system and the need for extensive evaluation across diverse setups makes this a challenging project requiring considerable resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "If successful, MetaSched could have substantial impact on the field of distributed neural network training. The democratization aspect is particularly significant, as it addresses a key barrier for smaller research teams without specialized HPC expertise. The potential 20-30% reduction in training time and 15-25% energy savings would benefit both industry and academic research, enabling more experimentation and faster iteration. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of making large-scale training more accessible. The approach could also advance our understanding of optimal resource allocation strategies for complex computational graphs. The significance is limited only by the fact that it addresses an efficiency problem rather than enabling fundamentally new capabilities."
