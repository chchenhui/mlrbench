        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the GAIED workshop's focus on exploring generative AI for education. It specifically addresses the GAI→ED thrust by proposing an LLM-based Socratic learning partner that creates a novel human-machine collaborative system. The idea explores AI in a new educational role (as a peer rather than tutor), which directly matches the workshop's interest in 'exploring novel human-machine collaborative systems where generative models play different roles.' The proposal includes evaluation through user studies, which connects to the workshop's interest in real-world educational applications. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly address the ED→GAI thrust regarding safeguards or concerns, though it does implicitly address educational challenges by focusing on deeper learning rather than just answer provision."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (inconsistent peer interaction, AI tutors providing answers without stimulating deeper inquiry), the proposed solution (an LLM-based Socratic learning partner), the methodology (prompting strategies and fine-tuning on educational dialogues), and evaluation approach (user studies measuring specific learning outcomes). The distinction between a Socratic learning partner and a typical AI tutor is well-defined. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific prompting strategies to be employed and the exact metrics for evaluation, which would benefit from more detailed elaboration. However, for a research idea summary, the level of clarity is very good and provides sufficient information to understand the concept and approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its specific application and approach. While AI tutors and educational agents exist, the explicit focus on designing an AI system to function as a Socratic peer rather than an authoritative tutor represents a fresh perspective. The emphasis on inquiry, reflection, and metacognitive skill development through simulated peer interaction offers a novel angle compared to most existing educational AI systems that focus on content delivery or direct instruction. However, the core techniques mentioned (prompting strategies and fine-tuning) are standard approaches in the field, and Socratic questioning itself is a well-established educational method. The innovation lies in the specific application and design goals rather than in fundamentally new technical approaches. The idea combines existing concepts in a new way rather than introducing entirely new methods."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology. Modern LLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in maintaining dialogue and can be effectively guided through prompting and fine-tuning to adopt specific conversational styles. The Socratic method is well-documented and provides clear patterns that could be incorporated into model training. The evaluation approach through user studies is standard practice in educational technology research. The resources required (access to LLMs, educational dialogue datasets, and participants for user studies) are reasonable and attainable. The main implementation challenges would likely be in creating sufficiently diverse training data representing effective Socratic dialogues and ensuring the model consistently maintains the Socratic approach rather than defaulting to direct instruction. However, these challenges are manageable with careful design and iteration, making the overall idea quite feasible."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses an important gap in educational AI applications. While many AI tutoring systems focus on content delivery and direct instruction, fewer target the development of metacognitive skills and deeper learning through inquiry-based approaches. The potential impact is significant as it could provide a scalable way to deliver high-quality Socratic learning experiences that are often limited by teacher availability or peer capabilities. If successful, such a system could enhance critical thinking skills, which are increasingly important in the information age. The approach also addresses concerns about AI in education merely providing answers rather than fostering deeper understanding. The significance extends beyond the specific implementation to potentially influencing how we conceptualize AI's role in education more broadly. The main limitation to its significance is that it addresses one specific pedagogical approach rather than transforming educational AI more fundamentally."
