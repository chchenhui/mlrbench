        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It addresses the workshop's focus on world models, particularly in the areas of causal understanding and temporal modeling using Transformers and SSMs as mentioned in the task description. The proposal directly implements the research idea of training world models to predict counterfactual latent states resulting from hypothetical interventions. It also builds upon the literature review by incorporating concepts from papers on causal mechanisms, counterfactual learning, and causal representations. However, it could have more explicitly addressed some workshop topics like scaling across language and vision, and could have more directly referenced specific papers from the literature review to show how it extends or differs from prior work."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally well-structured and articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are clearly defined. The mathematical formulation provides a concise representation of the autoregressive and counterfactual prediction components. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The specific mechanisms for incorporating interventions into the model architecture could be more detailed; (2) The relationship between the latent state space and causal structures could be more explicitly defined; (3) The evaluation metrics, while comprehensive, could be more precisely defined with specific benchmarks or baselines. Overall, while the main concepts are understandable, some technical details would benefit from additional elaboration."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a moderately novel approach by combining counterfactual reasoning with world models. The integration of counterfactual latent state prediction into world models represents an interesting direction that extends beyond standard predictive modeling. However, similar ideas appear in the literature review (papers 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 all discuss counterfactual reasoning in world models or latent state spaces). The proposal doesn't clearly articulate how it significantly differs from or advances beyond these existing approaches. While the combination of Transformer and SSM architectures for this purpose has some novelty, the core concept of training models to predict counterfactual outcomes is not groundbreaking in the context of the provided literature. The proposal would benefit from more clearly identifying its unique contributions relative to existing work."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulation provides a reasonable framework for the proposed approach, and the methodology follows logical steps from data collection to evaluation. The combination of autoregressive prediction with counterfactual prediction is theoretically justified. However, there are some limitations: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential confounding factors in the causal inference process; (2) The mechanism by which the model learns to distinguish correlation from causation could be more rigorously defined; (3) The theoretical guarantees for the model's causal discovery capabilities are not thoroughly discussed. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and follows established practices in both world modeling and causal inference."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with current technology and methods. The use of Transformer and SSM architectures is practical given their established success in sequential modeling tasks. The data collection strategy involving synthetic and real-world datasets is reasonable, and the evaluation metrics are measurable. The training procedure combining autoregressive and counterfactual prediction is implementable with existing deep learning frameworks. The experimental design provides a clear path for validating the approach. One potential challenge is the computational resources required for training complex world models, especially when incorporating counterfactual reasoning, but this is manageable with modern computing infrastructure. Overall, the proposal outlines a realistic research plan with well-defined steps and reasonable resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important challenge in world modeling: incorporating causal understanding to improve generalization and robustness. If successful, this research could lead to more reliable and interpretable world models with applications in robotics, healthcare, and other domains where understanding causal relationships is crucial. The ability to predict outcomes under hypothetical interventions would enhance decision-making processes in complex environments. However, the proposal could more clearly articulate the specific real-world problems it would solve and quantify the expected improvements over existing approaches. While the potential impact is significant, the proposal doesn't fully demonstrate how the advances would translate to transformative changes in specific applications. The significance is clear, but the magnitude of the potential impact could be more precisely defined."

It is well-structured, technically sound, and feasible with current technology. The potential impact on applications requiring robust decision-making is significant. However, the novelty is somewhat limited given similar approaches in the literature, and some technical details could be more clearly articulated. Overall, this is a good proposal with clear strengths in feasibility and consistency with the task requirements, balanced by moderate limitations in novelty and some aspects of clarity.",
