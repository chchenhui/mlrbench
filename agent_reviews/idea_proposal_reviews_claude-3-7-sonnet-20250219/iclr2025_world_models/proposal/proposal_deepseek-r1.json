    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on world models, particularly in the areas of causal understanding and temporal modeling. The proposal incorporates the core idea of counterfactual latent state prediction and builds upon the literature review by citing relevant works and extending their concepts. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposed approach will leverage architectures like Transformers and SSMs as mentioned in both the task description and research idea. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are consistent with the goal of assessing causal understanding in world models. The only minor inconsistency is that some references mentioned in the proposal (e.g., [3], [4]) don't perfectly align with the numbering in the literature review, but this doesn't significantly impact the overall coherence."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate technical details. The mathematical formulations of the model architecture and training objectives are precise and well-defined. The experimental design and expected outcomes are also clearly outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) The exact mechanism for generating counterfactual examples during training could be more detailed, (2) The relationship between the attention weights and the causal graph G in the loss function could be further elaborated, and (3) The proposal could more explicitly define how the intervention-aware prediction head computes counterfactual latents. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of counterfactual reasoning into world models through a dual-objective loss function that explicitly handles both factual and counterfactual predictions is innovative. The intervention-aware prediction head with modified attention mechanisms conditioned on intervention signals represents a fresh approach to modeling causal relationships in latent space. However, the core concepts build upon existing work in causal inference, world models, and transformer architectures rather than introducing entirely new paradigms. The proposal extends and combines ideas from the literature (such as DCM, Causal Transformer, and DreamerV3) rather than proposing a fundamentally new approach. While not groundbreaking, the proposal offers a valuable new perspective on integrating causality into world models."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is built on established techniques in deep learning and causal inference, with clear mathematical formulations for the model architecture and training objectives. The dual-loss function that balances factual prediction with counterfactual divergence is theoretically well-grounded. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that directly assess the claimed benefits of the approach. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. The proposal also acknowledges the need for both synthetic environments with ground-truth causal graphs and real-world benchmarks for comprehensive evaluation. One minor limitation is that the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in optimizing the complex loss function with multiple terms, particularly regarding the stability of training. Overall, the technical approach is sound and well-justified."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The model architecture builds on established components (Transformers, SSMs) that have proven effective in similar contexts. The datasets mentioned (CoPhy benchmark, RoboNet) are publicly available, and synthetic data generation for controlled causal evaluation is a reasonable approach. The evaluation metrics are well-defined and measurable. However, several aspects may require significant effort: (1) Generating paired factual and counterfactual sequences with ground-truth causal relationships at scale could be resource-intensive, (2) Training the hybrid architecture with multiple loss terms might require careful hyperparameter tuning and optimization strategies, (3) Recovering accurate causal graphs from attention weights is non-trivial and may require sophisticated post-processing. While these challenges are substantial, they don't render the proposal infeasible, but rather indicate areas requiring careful implementation and potentially additional computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important gap in current world modeling approaches by incorporating explicit causal reasoning capabilities. This has significant implications for improving the robustness and generalization of AI systems in critical domains. The potential applications in healthcare (simulating treatment responses), robotics (enabling robust manipulation), and scientific discovery are well-justified and impactful. The expected improvements in zero-shot intervention scenarios (25% higher accuracy) and robust decision-making (â‰¥90% success rates under perturbations) would represent meaningful advances in the field. The work also contributes to the broader goal of developing more interpretable AI systems through the recovery of causal structures. While the immediate impact might be primarily in research settings and controlled environments, the long-term implications for building more reliable and adaptable AI systems are substantial. The proposal aligns well with current research priorities in causal AI and world modeling, making it a timely and significant contribution."
