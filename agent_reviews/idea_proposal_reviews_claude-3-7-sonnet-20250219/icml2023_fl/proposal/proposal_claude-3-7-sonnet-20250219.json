    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'training, fine-tuning, and personalizing (foundation) models in federated settings' and 'scalable and robust federated machine learning systems.' The proposal expands significantly on the initial idea of FedPEFT by developing a comprehensive framework (FedPEFT+) that incorporates adaptive PEFT module allocation based on client capabilities and data characteristics, specialized aggregation strategies, and mechanisms for handling heterogeneity - all core elements from the original idea. The proposal thoroughly engages with the literature, building upon works like SLoRA, FeDeRA, and other federated PEFT approaches mentioned in the review, while clearly identifying and addressing their limitations regarding device heterogeneity and adaptive configurations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives, framework components, and technical approaches are explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The adaptive PEFT module allocation, local training process, and specialized aggregation strategies are particularly well-defined. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering various foundation models, tasks, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for determining the utility function parameters (α, β, γ) could be more explicitly defined; (2) The transition between different PEFT techniques during training rounds could be elaborated; and (3) Some technical details about the heterogeneous PEFT fusion approach could be further explained. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The adaptive allocation of PEFT modules based on client capabilities and data characteristics represents a fresh approach not fully explored in existing literature. The specialized aggregation strategies for different PEFT types and the mechanisms for handling non-IID data and system heterogeneity also offer innovative perspectives. However, the core concept of applying PEFT techniques in federated settings has been explored in prior work (as acknowledged in the literature review with SLoRA, FeDeRA, FedP²EFT, etc.). While FedPEFT+ extends these approaches with novel components, it builds upon established foundations rather than introducing entirely groundbreaking concepts. The proposal effectively combines and enhances existing techniques rather than creating fundamentally new methods, which is valuable but limits its novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for LoRA, adapters, and prompt tuning are correctly presented, and the utility function for adaptive allocation is well-defined. The local training process incorporates appropriate regularization to prevent catastrophic forgetting, and the specialized aggregation strategies are theoretically justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering multiple foundation models, tasks, and evaluation metrics with appropriate baselines for comparison. The handling of non-IID data and system heterogeneity is addressed with sound technical approaches. However, there are some areas that could benefit from additional theoretical analysis: (1) Convergence guarantees for the proposed aggregation methods are not fully addressed; (2) The theoretical impact of mixing different PEFT techniques on model performance could be more rigorously analyzed; and (3) The privacy implications of the approach could be more formally assessed. Despite these limitations, the overall technical approach is well-founded and rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with realistic implementation paths. The use of established PEFT techniques (LoRA, adapters, prompt tuning) provides a solid foundation, and the experimental design with specific models and tasks is practical. The simulation of client heterogeneity with different device profiles is realistic and implementable. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) The computational overhead of profiling client capabilities and data characteristics in real-world settings may be significant; (2) The adaptive allocation mechanism requires sophisticated coordination between server and clients that may be complex to implement efficiently; (3) Testing with very large foundation models like LLaMA-2 (7B) in a federated setting will require substantial computational resources; and (4) The heterogeneous PEFT fusion approach through knowledge distillation may face practical challenges in a distributed environment. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they do increase implementation complexity and resource requirements."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in the deployment of foundation models in federated settings, with potential for substantial impact. The expected outcomes include significant reductions in communication overhead (95-99%), enhanced performance under heterogeneity (10-25% improvement), and 5-10x reduction in training time and memory requirements - all of which would represent meaningful advances in the field. The democratization of foundation models by enabling their use on resource-constrained devices has broad implications for privacy-preserving AI applications in healthcare, personal assistants, and edge computing. The framework's flexibility across multiple domains (NLP, computer vision, multimodal tasks) further enhances its significance. The research also opens several promising future directions, including continual learning, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and federated foundation model pre-training. While the immediate impact is focused on the specific intersection of federated learning and foundation models rather than transforming the broader AI landscape, the significance within this domain is substantial."
