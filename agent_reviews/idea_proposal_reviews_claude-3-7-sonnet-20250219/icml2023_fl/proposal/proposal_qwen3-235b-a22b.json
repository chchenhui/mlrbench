    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'training, fine-tuning, and personalizing (foundation) models in federated settings' and 'scalable and robust federated machine learning systems.' The proposal elaborates comprehensively on the initial idea of adapting PEFT techniques for federated settings, maintaining the core concept of transmitting only small PEFT modules instead of entire models. It builds upon the literature review by acknowledging and extending works like SLoRA, FeDeRA, and FedPEAT, while addressing the key challenges identified in the review, particularly data heterogeneity, resource constraints, and communication efficiency. The methodology section clearly demonstrates how the proposal tackles these challenges through dynamic PEFT module allocation and specialized aggregation techniques."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and implementation details. The proposal effectively communicates complex concepts like Low-Rank Adaptation and adapter modules with precise mathematical notation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for progressive unfreezing could be more detailed, (2) The relationship between the budget score and the specific PEFT parameters could be more explicitly formulated, and (3) The 'Figure 1' is referenced but not provided in the proposal. Despite these minor issues, the overall clarity is strong, making the research direction and methodology easily understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing several novel components to the federated PEFT landscape. The dynamic allocation of PEFT modules based on client capabilities is a fresh approach that extends beyond existing works like SLoRA and FeDeRA. The Weighted Low-Rank Averaging (WLRA) aggregation strategy and the personalized regularization technique also represent innovative contributions. However, the core concept of applying PEFT to federated learning has been explored in prior work (as acknowledged in the literature review with papers like FedPEFT from 2022), and some components like using LoRA and adapters are adaptations of existing techniques. The proposal builds incrementally on these foundations rather than presenting a completely revolutionary approach. The novelty lies primarily in the comprehensive framework that integrates resource-aware allocation, heterogeneity mitigation, and specialized aggregation techniques, rather than in introducing fundamentally new PEFT methods."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for LoRA and adapters are correctly presented, and the theoretical analysis includes a convergence bound and communication cost analysis that are well-grounded in optimization theory. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets spanning text, speech, and vision domains, and a robust set of baselines including both traditional FL methods and PEFT-based approaches. The metrics cover multiple dimensions (utility, efficiency, privacy, fairness) providing a holistic evaluation framework. The methodology logically builds upon established techniques in both federated learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) The theoretical convergence bound could include more detailed assumptions and derivation steps, (2) The privacy analysis could be strengthened with formal guarantees rather than just empirical MIA risk reduction, and (3) The fairness evaluation could be more theoretically grounded. Despite these limitations, the overall technical approach is sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation details. The use of established frameworks like PySyft and Flower for implementation enhances practicality. The experimental design is comprehensive and achievable, with clearly defined datasets, baselines, and metrics. The communication efficiency gains through PEFT (reducing parameters to ≤1% of the full model) make the approach viable even for resource-constrained devices. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) The dynamic allocation of PEFT modules requires sophisticated client profiling and clustering, which may be complex to implement in real-world heterogeneous environments, (2) The progressive unfreezing approach may introduce additional complexity in synchronization across clients, and (3) The evaluation across three different domains (text, speech, vision) is ambitious and may require significant computational resources. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do represent non-trivial hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in the field of federated learning: enabling resource-constrained devices to participate in fine-tuning large foundation models while preserving privacy. This has substantial practical implications for deploying advanced AI capabilities to edge devices in domains like healthcare, mobile computing, and IoT. The expected outcomes include significant efficiency gains (1,000× reduction in communication overhead) and performance improvements (90% accuracy with 30% fewer training rounds) that would represent meaningful advances in the field. The work bridges an important gap between theoretical PEFT advancements and practical FL deployment, directly addressing the workshop's goal of connecting theory and practice. The potential impact extends beyond academic contributions to industry adoption in privacy-sensitive domains. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the advances over existing work like SLoRA and FeDeRA, rather than representing a paradigm shift in the field. Nevertheless, the comprehensive framework and practical focus give this proposal substantial significance for advancing federated learning with foundation models."
