    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'training, fine-tuning, and personalizing (foundation) models in federated settings' and 'scalable and robust federated machine learning systems.' The proposal builds upon the literature review by acknowledging and extending work from papers like SLoRA, FeDeRA, and FedP²EFT, while addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly data heterogeneity, resource constraints, and communication efficiency. The methodology section clearly outlines how FedPEFT will tackle these challenges through adaptive PEFT module allocation and SVD-weighted aggregation. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal could have more explicitly addressed privacy and security aspects mentioned in the task description, though privacy preservation is mentioned as a motivation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is well-defined with mathematical formulations for the LoRA parameterization, adaptive rank determination, and aggregation strategy. The experimental design section clearly outlines datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The inclusion of a figure reference (Figure 1) helps visualize the SVD-weighted aggregation workflow. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for SVD-weighted aggregation could be more thoroughly explained, (2) the relationship between the adaptive PEFT module allocation and personalization could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the lightweight profiler for assessing device capabilities are not fully elaborated."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a new way. The core innovation lies in the adaptive PEFT module allocation strategy that tailors module complexity to client device capabilities and data characteristics, and the SVD-weighted aggregation mechanism for heterogeneous PEFT updates. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated settings has been explored in prior work (as evidenced by SLoRA, FeDeRA, and FedP²EFT in the literature review), this proposal differentiates itself by focusing specifically on device heterogeneity and adaptive rank allocation. The SVD-weighted averaging scheme for aggregation also appears to be a novel contribution. However, the proposal builds incrementally on existing PEFT and federated learning techniques rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm, which limits its novelty score from reaching the highest levels."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established methods from both federated learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The mathematical formulations for LoRA parameterization and the adaptive rank determination are correctly presented. The SVD-weighted aggregation strategy is theoretically justified, leveraging the singular value decomposition to weight client contributions based on both data size and the importance of their updates. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges of non-IID data distributions and device heterogeneity, which are critical considerations in federated learning. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from more rigorous justification: (1) the choice of coefficients λ1, λ2, λ3 in the adaptive rank formula is not fully explained, (2) the theoretical convergence properties of the SVD-weighted aggregation method are not analyzed, and (3) potential privacy implications of transmitting singular values could be more thoroughly addressed."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation plans. The use of established frameworks (PyTorch and Flower) and well-known foundation models (ViT-Base and DistilBERT) increases practicality. The experimental design is reasonable, with appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics. The adaptive PEFT module allocation strategy is implementable using device profiling techniques, and the SVD-weighted aggregation can be realized with standard linear algebra operations. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the lightweight profiler for assessing device capabilities may face challenges in accurately measuring available resources in real-world settings, (2) the simulation of 100+ clients with varying resource constraints may not fully capture real-world heterogeneity, (3) the communication of singular values adds overhead that partially offsets the benefits of reduced parameter transmission, and (4) the computational cost of SVD operations on the server side could become significant with many clients. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present implementation hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in deploying foundation models in federated settings, which has significant implications for privacy-preserving AI applications. The expected outcomes of 80-95% reduction in communication costs and enabling low-tier devices to achieve 70-90% of the accuracy of high-tier devices would represent meaningful advances in democratizing access to state-of-the-art AI models. The work aligns well with regulatory requirements like GDPR and HIPAA, enhancing its practical significance. The potential impact spans multiple domains including healthcare, smart devices, and personalized AI services. The open-sourcing of the FedPEFT framework would provide value to the research community as a benchmark for future work. While the significance is high, it falls short of the highest score because the proposal focuses on improving existing paradigms rather than enabling entirely new capabilities or applications that weren't previously possible, and the impact may be limited to specific scenarios where both federated learning and foundation models are applicable."
