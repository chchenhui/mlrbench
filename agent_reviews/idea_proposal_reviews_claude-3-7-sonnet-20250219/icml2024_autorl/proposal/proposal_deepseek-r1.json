    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on automating RL through LLMs and meta-learning, specifically targeting hyperparameter optimization which is identified as a critical challenge in the literature review. The proposal incorporates key concepts from the literature review, including the dynamic nature of hyperparameter landscapes (from AutoRL Hyperparameter Landscapes) and the need for efficient hyperparameter tuning (from 'Hyperparameters in RL and How To Tune Them'). The methodology also draws inspiration from the ReMA paper's approach to using LLMs in RL contexts. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions ARLBench as a benchmark for evaluating HPO approaches, the proposal doesn't explicitly incorporate this benchmark in its evaluation framework, opting instead for Procgen, NetHack, and Meta-World ML45."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate technical details. The two-phase approach (meta-training and deployment) is well-defined, and the mathematical formulations provide rigor to the proposed methods. The experimental design section clearly outlines baselines, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for encoding RL trajectories into LLM-digestible prompts could be more detailed, (2) The integration between the LLM's outputs and the RL algorithm's hyperparameter updates could be more explicitly defined, and (3) The proposal could more clearly articulate how the meta-policy optimization connects to the LLM finetuning process. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to dynamic hyperparameter adaptation in RL by leveraging LLMs as meta-learners. While hyperparameter optimization for RL is not new, and LLMs have been applied to various aspects of RL, the specific combination of using LLMs for real-time hyperparameter adaptation during training represents a significant innovation. The proposal distinguishes itself from existing work like OptFormer by focusing on dynamic, in-training adaptation rather than offline optimization. The framing of hyperparameter adjustment as a meta-policy and the integration with meta-reinforcement learning adds another layer of novelty. The proposal also innovates in its approach to prompt engineering for RL trajectory representation. However, it builds upon existing concepts in meta-learning and AutoML rather than introducing entirely new paradigms, which slightly limits its novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for LLM finetuning and meta-policy optimization are technically sound and well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical analysis methods. The two-phase approach (meta-training and deployment) is logically structured and builds on established practices in meta-learning. However, there are some areas where the technical soundness could be strengthened: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in optimizing the meta-policy gradient, which could be unstable due to the high variance of RL returns, (2) The regularization term in the LLM finetuning loss function is mentioned but not thoroughly justified, and (3) The proposal lacks detailed discussion of how to handle the potential mismatch between the discrete nature of LLM outputs and the continuous hyperparameter space. These limitations, while not critical, prevent the proposal from achieving the highest soundness score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the use of existing benchmarks (Procgen, NetHack, Meta-World) and baseline methods is practical. The two-phase approach allows for incremental development and testing. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) Finetuning LLMs requires substantial computational resources, especially when training on diverse RL tasks, (2) Generating high-quality prompt-response pairs for hyperparameter adaptation may require extensive expert knowledge or simulation, (3) The real-time integration of LLM inference with RL training could introduce significant computational overhead, potentially slowing down the training process, (4) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle the cold-start problem when deploying to entirely new environments, and (5) The expected 15-30% improvement in sample efficiency seems optimistic without preliminary results. These challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, but they do present significant hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning: the brittleness of hyperparameter configurations and the need for expert tuning. If successful, HyperPrompt could significantly impact the RL field by: (1) Reducing the expertise barrier for applying RL to new problems, democratizing access to effective RL solutions, (2) Improving sample efficiency, which is particularly valuable in domains where interactions are costly, (3) Enhancing generalization across environments, addressing a fundamental limitation of current RL approaches, and (4) Establishing new connections between LLMs, meta-learning, and AutoRL, potentially inspiring new research directions. The proposal aligns well with the workshop's focus on automating RL and could contribute meaningful insights to multiple communities. The potential for reducing computational waste from exhaustive hyperparameter searches also adds environmental significance. While the impact would be substantial within the RL community, it might not transform broader AI applications immediately, which slightly limits the significance score."
