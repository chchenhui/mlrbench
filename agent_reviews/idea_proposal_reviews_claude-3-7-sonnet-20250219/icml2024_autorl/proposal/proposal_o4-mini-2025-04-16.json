    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on automating RL through LLMs and meta-learning, specifically targeting hyperparameter optimization which is identified as a key challenge in the task description. The proposal builds upon the literature review by acknowledging the dynamic nature of hyperparameter landscapes (Mohan et al.), extending OptFormer's approach (Eimer et al.) with real-time adaptability, utilizing ARLBench for evaluation, and incorporating LLM meta-learning concepts similar to ReMA. The methodology clearly addresses the research idea of using LLMs as meta-learners for dynamic hyperparameter adaptation. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions multi-agent approaches (ReMA), the proposal doesn't explicitly incorporate multi-agent techniques."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are specific and well-defined. The methodology section provides a comprehensive mathematical formulation of the meta-MDP framework, with clear explanations of meta-states, meta-actions, and meta-rewards. The algorithms for meta-training and online adaptation are presented step-by-step, making implementation straightforward. The experimental design is detailed, with specific benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for discretizing hyperparameter updates in the model fine-tuning section is not fully specified, (2) the relationship between the meta-reward function and long-term RL performance could be more explicitly justified, and (3) some technical details about prompt construction and tokenization are left somewhat abstract."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of LLMs with meta-reinforcement learning for dynamic hyperparameter adaptation. While both LLMs and hyperparameter optimization for RL exist separately, their combination in this manner is innovative. The framing of hyperparameter adaptation as a meta-MDP and the use of an LLM as a meta-policy represents a fresh approach. The two-phase training (supervised learning followed by meta-RL fine-tuning) is a creative solution to the challenge of training LLMs for this task. The proposal distinguishes itself from prior work like OptFormer by focusing on online, dynamic adaptation rather than offline optimization. However, it builds upon existing concepts in meta-RL and LLM fine-tuning rather than introducing entirely new algorithmic paradigms, which slightly limits its novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded. The meta-MDP formulation is theoretically appropriate for the problem, and the training objectives are well-defined. The two-stage training approach (supervised learning followed by meta-RL fine-tuning) is justified and addresses different aspects of the learning problem. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics. However, there are some potential theoretical concerns: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address how the LLM will handle the potentially high-dimensional and continuous nature of the meta-state space, (2) the REINFORCE gradient estimation might suffer from high variance in this setting, and (3) there's limited discussion of how to ensure the LLM's outputs remain within valid hyperparameter ranges. Additionally, while the meta-reward function is defined, there's limited justification for why this particular formulation would lead to optimal long-term performance."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the authors specify concrete models (GPT-2 variants), algorithms (PPO, SAC), and hardware requirements (4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs). The compute budget of 50k GPU hours seems reasonable for the scope. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) collecting sufficient high-quality data for meta-training across diverse environments may be extremely time-consuming, (2) the inference overhead of querying an LLM during RL training could significantly slow down the learning process, (3) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of LLM inference latency, (4) fine-tuning LLMs with policy gradient methods is known to be unstable, and (5) the expected 30-50% reduction in sample complexity seems optimistic without preliminary results. While the authors mention some mitigations (e.g., model distillation), these solutions introduce additional complexity."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning: the brittleness of algorithms to hyperparameter choices and the need for extensive manual tuning. If successful, HyperPrompt could significantly democratize RL by reducing the expertise and computational resources required for effective deployment. The potential impact extends beyond academic research to practical applications in robotics, finance, and healthcare, as noted in the broader impact section. The framework also establishes a novel connection between LLMs and AutoRL that could inspire further research in this direction. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on hyperparameter adaptation alone, rather than addressing other aspects of AutoRL such as architecture search or curriculum design, but within its scope, the potential impact is substantial."
