    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on automating RL through the integration of LLMs and meta-learning approaches. The proposal builds upon the identified challenges in the literature review, particularly addressing dynamic hyperparameter landscapes (Mohan et al., 2023), computational overhead (Eimer et al., 2023), generalization across environments, and LLM integration in RL. The methodology incorporates ARLBench for evaluation, as mentioned in the literature review. The proposal maintains fidelity to the original research idea of using LLMs as meta-learners for hyperparameter adaptation while expanding it with detailed implementation strategies. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal occasionally references works not explicitly mentioned in the literature review (e.g., OptFormer is mentioned in the task description but details aren't provided in the literature review)."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and conclusion. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the technical approach is described in detail. The prompt engineering process, meta-training framework, and experimental design are all thoroughly explained with appropriate mathematical formulations. The proposal uses consistent terminology and provides concrete examples of implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the LLM's hyperparameter recommendations into the RL training loop could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical details about the trajectory compression and tokenization process are somewhat vague, and (3) the relationship between the meta-learning framework and the RL optimization could be further elaborated to ensure complete understanding of the dual-optimization process."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to hyperparameter optimization in RL by leveraging LLMs as meta-controllers for dynamic adaptation. This represents a significant departure from traditional AutoML approaches like Bayesian optimization or population-based training. The integration of LLMs' in-context learning capabilities with meta-RL principles is innovative, particularly the framing of hyperparameter adaptation as a POMDP. The prompt engineering approach for encoding trajectory data and performance metrics is creative and well-designed. The proposal also introduces novel evaluation metrics like adaptation quality (M_adapt) and time-dependent HPO priors. While some components build upon existing work in meta-learning and LLM fine-tuning, the combination and application to dynamic hyperparameter adaptation in RL represents a fresh perspective. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more novel theoretical foundations beyond the application of existing LLM and meta-learning techniques."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations by grounding the approach in established RL, meta-learning, and LLM concepts. The mathematical formulations for the meta-training framework and reward modeling are technically correct. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering diverse environments, algorithms, baselines, and ablation studies. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be improved: (1) the discretization of continuous hyperparameters into bins may introduce optimization challenges that aren't fully addressed, (2) the hybrid loss function combining supervised and RL objectives needs more justification for the choice of λ=0.5, (3) the attention analysis methodology lacks detail on how the correlation between attention patterns and hyperparameter importance would be rigorously established, and (4) there's limited discussion of potential failure modes or theoretical limitations of the approach. The proposal acknowledges computational constraints and provides reasonable solutions, but some of the theoretical claims about LLM attention mechanisms encoding meta-learning principles would benefit from stronger justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, it leverages existing tools (RLlib, StableBaselines3), uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), and provides concrete details on data collection and experimental design. The computational requirements seem reasonable, with training on ≤10^4 prompt-response pairs and inference latency targets of <100ms. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) the creation of a diverse, high-quality dataset spanning multiple RL algorithms and environments is resource-intensive and may be challenging to curate effectively, (2) the tokenization and compression of trajectory data into LLM-digestible formats while preserving critical information is non-trivial, (3) the proposal aims to generalize across discrete and continuous control tasks with very different characteristics, which may be overly ambitious, and (4) the expected performance improvements (30-50% faster convergence, 20-40% higher reward efficiency) seem optimistic without preliminary results to support these claims. Additionally, the integration of LLM inference into the RL training loop introduces potential latency issues that could impact real-time performance, especially in high-dimensional environments."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning: the brittleness of algorithms to hyperparameter choices and the need for dynamic adaptation. If successful, HyperPrompt could significantly impact the RL field by: (1) democratizing access to effective RL by reducing the expertise required for hyperparameter tuning, (2) improving sample efficiency and convergence rates in complex environments, (3) enabling more robust transfer to novel domains, and (4) bridging the gap between AutoML, meta-RL, and LLM communities. The potential practical applications are substantial, particularly for domains where environmental dynamics shift during training. The proposal also contributes theoretical advancements in understanding time-dependent hyperparameter landscapes and LLM-based meta-learning. The significance is enhanced by the commitment to open-source the prompt dataset and training code, facilitating community adoption. However, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed how the approach would scale to extremely large or complex RL problems beyond the benchmarks mentioned, which somewhat limits its potential impact on cutting-edge RL applications."
