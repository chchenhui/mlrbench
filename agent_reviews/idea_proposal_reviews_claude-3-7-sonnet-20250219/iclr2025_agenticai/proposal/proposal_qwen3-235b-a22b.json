    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses Thrust 1 of the workshop by developing a multi-agent system for scientific discovery, specifically focusing on hypothesis generation. The proposal incorporates game theory for agent coordination (mentioned in Thrust 2) and applies the framework to chemistry and genetics (addressing Thrust 3). The DecompAI framework clearly builds upon the literature review, citing and extending work from AstroAgents, VirSci, and SciAgents while addressing the coordination challenges identified in the review. The proposal maintains consistency with the original idea of decomposing hypothesis generation into specialized agents and implements all aspects mentioned in the motivation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, challenges, and timeline. The framework architecture is thoroughly explained with specific details about each agent's role and their interactions. The mathematical formulations for agent utilities and coordination mechanisms are precisely defined. The experimental design, including datasets and evaluation metrics, is comprehensively outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the GKG could be more specific, (2) some technical terms (e.g., Fukui indices) are used without sufficient explanation for non-domain experts, and (3) the transition between theoretical formulations and practical implementations could be more explicitly connected."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in several aspects. The integration of game theory (Nash bargaining) for agent coordination in scientific hypothesis generation is innovative and distinguishes it from prior work like AstroAgents and VirSci. The domain-specific hybrid models combining symbolic and subsymbolic approaches represent a fresh perspective. The dynamic global knowledge graph with specialized agents is a novel architecture for hypothesis generation. However, the core concept of using multiple agents for scientific tasks builds upon existing frameworks mentioned in the literature review, and some components (like knowledge graphs and specialized agents) have precedents in systems like SciAgents. While the proposal combines these elements in new ways, it represents an evolution rather than a revolutionary approach to the problem."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. The game-theoretic approach to agent coordination is well-formulated with clear utility functions and optimization objectives. The integration of domain knowledge through specialized agents is technically sound, with appropriate models selected for each agent's function. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, with well-defined metrics and baselines. The proposal acknowledges potential challenges and offers mitigation strategies. The technical formulations, particularly the Nash bargaining game and utility functions, are correctly presented. However, some aspects could benefit from deeper theoretical justification: (1) the convergence properties of the Nash bargaining solution in this specific context, (2) the theoretical guarantees for knowledge graph consistency, and (3) more rigorous validation of the domain-specific model designs against established benchmarks."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible implementation plan with realistic components. The use of existing models (BERT-based language models, GNNs) and datasets (USPTO, KEGG) enhances practicality. The timeline is reasonable, with appropriate phasing of development, training, evaluation, and dissemination. The challenges section acknowledges potential implementation difficulties and offers mitigation strategies. However, several aspects present moderate feasibility concerns: (1) the computational resources required for training and running multiple specialized models simultaneously could be substantial, (2) the integration of symbolic reasoning with neural approaches is technically challenging and may require significant engineering effort, (3) the creation and maintenance of the dynamic global knowledge graph at scale could face performance issues, and (4) the cross-domain validation might be more complex than anticipated, particularly for ensuring domain fidelity across different scientific fields."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in scientific discovery - automating hypothesis generation while maintaining domain fidelity and reducing hallucination. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) accelerating scientific discovery cycles by 5-10x through automated hypothesis enumeration, (2) generating 20-30% more testable hypotheses than existing systems, (3) enabling cross-domain scientific exploration, and (4) providing a framework that can be extended to other scientific domains. The work directly addresses the workshop's focus on agentic AI for science and could significantly advance the field of AI-driven scientific discovery. The societal impacts, including accelerating interdisciplinary research and combating AI hallucination, are well-articulated and meaningful. While the impact could be transformative in specific domains, the broader scientific impact may depend on successful adaptation across multiple scientific fields beyond the two test cases."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "DecompAI represents an excellent research proposal that effectively addresses the workshop's focus on agentic AI for scientific discovery. It combines theoretical innovation (game-theoretic coordination), practical implementation (specialized agents with domain expertise), and meaningful evaluation (cross-domain validation). The proposal builds thoughtfully on existing literature while introducing novel elements that could advance the field. While there are some feasibility challenges and areas where theoretical foundations could be strengthened, the overall approach is sound, well-structured, and has significant potential impact.",
