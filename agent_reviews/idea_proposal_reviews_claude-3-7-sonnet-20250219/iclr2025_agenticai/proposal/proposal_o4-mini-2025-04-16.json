        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses Thrust 1 of the workshop by designing a multi-agent system for scientific discovery, incorporating theoretical foundations (Thrust 2) through game-theoretic utility functions and trust-region optimization. The practical applications (Thrust 3) are well-covered through domain-specific adaptations for chemistry and genetics. The proposal builds upon the multi-agent frameworks mentioned in the literature review (AstroAgents, VirSci, SciAgents) while addressing their limitations regarding coordination mechanisms and hallucination. It also incorporates the game-theoretic approach from the MATRL paper. The proposal maintains consistency with the original idea of decomposing hypothesis generation into specialized agents with a shared knowledge graph."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The system architecture is thoroughly explained with detailed descriptions of each component (Domain Explorer, Knowledge Retriever, Reasoning Engine, Experimental Validator, and Orchestrator). The mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly the Dynamic Knowledge Graph representation, agent scoring functions, and game-theoretic utility functions. The methodology section provides comprehensive implementation details, including models, training approaches, and hardware requirements. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as the exact mechanisms for resolving conflicts between agents and more details on how the human-in-the-loop integration practically works beyond providing feedback signals."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality in several aspects. The integration of game-theoretic utility functions to balance cooperation and divergence among agents is innovative and addresses a key limitation in existing multi-agent systems. The Dynamic Knowledge Graph as a shared communication medium with formal read/write operations is a fresh approach to agent coordination. The incorporation of experimental validation with resource cost modeling is also novel. However, the core multi-agent architecture builds upon existing frameworks like SciAgents and AstroAgents rather than introducing a completely new paradigm. The proposal combines and extends existing concepts in a valuable way but doesn't represent a revolutionary departure from prior work in the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations are well-defined, particularly the graph representation, agent scoring functions, and game-theoretic utility functions. The use of trust-region optimization methods (MATRL) for tuning coordination coefficients is theoretically sound and based on established research. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive, with clear metrics, baselines, and statistical analysis plans. The implementation details are specific and feasible. However, there are some areas that could benefit from deeper theoretical justification, such as the convergence guarantees of the multi-agent system and more formal analysis of how the proposed utility functions will lead to optimal hypothesis generation. The proposal could also provide more details on how hallucination is detected and mitigated beyond human feedback."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The use of GPT-4 based LLMs, HuggingFace Transformers, Neo4j for knowledge graphs, and FAISS for retrieval are all established technologies. The hardware requirements (NVIDIA A100 GPUs) are substantial but available in research settings. The data collection approach using existing databases (Reaxys, PubChem, KEGG) is practical. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require considerable effort. Fine-tuning domain-specific agents while preventing hallucination is non-trivial. The game-theoretic coordination mechanism, while theoretically sound, may be complex to implement effectively. The resource estimation for experimental validation would require extensive domain knowledge to model accurately. The human-in-the-loop integration would need careful interface design to be practical for domain experts. These challenges are acknowledged but would require significant engineering and research effort to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI-driven scientific discovery: generating relevant, novel, and testable hypotheses while maintaining transparency and reducing hallucination. If successful, DecompAI could significantly accelerate scientific discovery cycles, democratize AI-driven research through interpretable reasoning chains, and bridge disciplinary boundaries. The expected outcomes (+30% hypothesis novelty, +20% scientific validity, -15% resource cost, -40% hallucination rate) would represent meaningful improvements over existing approaches. The proposal aligns well with the workshop's focus on agentic AI for science and addresses multiple research thrusts. The impact extends beyond just hypothesis generation to include experimental validation and resource estimation, providing a more complete solution for scientific discovery. The open-source release of code, models, and benchmarks would further amplify the impact by fostering community adoption and extension."
