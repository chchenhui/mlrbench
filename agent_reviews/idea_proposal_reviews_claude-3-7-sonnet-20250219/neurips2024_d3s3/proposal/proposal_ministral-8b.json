        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on differentiable simulations, neural surrogates, and probabilistic inverse problems. The proposed Conditional Neural Operator (CNO) framework combines a Fourier Neural Operator with conditional normalizing flows for inverse modeling in turbulent flows, which matches the original research idea almost perfectly. The proposal also acknowledges and builds upon recent advances mentioned in the literature review, such as neural operators for PDE solutions and diffusion models for uncertainty quantification. The methodology section clearly outlines how the CNO will jointly learn forward PDE solution maps and approximate posteriors, which is consistent with the core idea presented. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review highlights some very recent works (2023-2025), the proposal could have more explicitly positioned itself relative to these specific papers."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is described in sufficient detail, including mathematical formulations of the FNO, conditional normalizing flow, and amortized variational inference approach. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined, providing a clear roadmap for implementation and assessment. The expected outcomes and impact are also clearly articulated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific turbulent flow scenarios that will be targeted could be more precisely defined, (2) the exact architecture of the conditional normalizing flow could be elaborated further, and (3) more details on how the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties will be disentangled and quantified would strengthen the proposal. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically structured."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining Fourier Neural Operators with conditional normalizing flows for probabilistic inverse modeling in turbulent flows. This integration of deterministic neural operators with probabilistic modeling techniques represents a fresh approach to handling inverse problems in complex physical systems. The end-to-end training via amortized variational inference on Navier-Stokes simulations is also innovative. However, the individual components (FNOs, normalizing flows, variational inference) are established techniques, and similar combinations have been explored in adjacent domains as indicated in the literature review. For example, the CoNFiLD model mentioned in the review also combines neural field encoding with probabilistic generation, and other papers discuss integrating neural operators with diffusion models. While the specific application to inverse modeling in turbulent flows and the particular combination of techniques shows originality, it builds incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness. The mathematical formulations for the Fourier Neural Operator, conditional normalizing flow, and amortized variational inference are correctly presented and well-justified. The approach is grounded in established principles from machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and computational fluid dynamics. The experimental design includes appropriate benchmarks and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The proposal also acknowledges the challenges in turbulent flow modeling and provides a coherent strategy to address them. The training methodology using synthetic Navier-Stokes simulations is appropriate for the task. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional rigor: (1) more detailed discussion of the convergence properties of the proposed method, (2) analysis of potential limitations or failure modes, and (3) more specific details on how the model will handle the multi-scale nature of turbulent flows. Despite these minor gaps, the overall technical foundation of the proposal is robust and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The use of synthetic Navier-Stokes simulations for training data is practical and well-established. The individual components (FNOs, normalizing flows) have been successfully implemented in prior work, suggesting that their integration is technically achievable. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are reasonable and can be implemented with current computational resources. However, there are several challenges that affect the feasibility: (1) generating diverse and high-quality turbulent flow simulations requires significant computational resources, (2) training neural operators on high-dimensional turbulent flow fields can be computationally intensive and may require specialized hardware, (3) the end-to-end training of both the FNO and conditional normalizing flow might face optimization difficulties, and (4) the proposal does not specify the exact scale of turbulent flows to be modeled, which could significantly impact feasibility if targeting very high Reynolds number flows. While these challenges are substantial, they do not render the project infeasible, but rather indicate areas requiring careful attention and potentially additional resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant challenge in computational physics and engineering: fast, accurate, and uncertainty-aware inverse modeling of turbulent flows. If successful, the CNO framework would have substantial impact across multiple domains including aerodynamics, climate modeling, chemical engineering, and manufacturing. The ability to provide real-time posterior samples and support backpropagation through the surrogate would enable new capabilities in design optimization and control of complex physical systems. The uncertainty quantification aspect is particularly valuable, as it addresses a critical gap in current modeling approaches. The proposal aligns well with the growing interest in differentiable physics and neural surrogate models in the scientific computing community. The potential to bridge the simulation-to-real gap has broad implications beyond the specific application to turbulent flows. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on synthetic data rather than real-world applications, and the proposal could more explicitly address how the method would transfer to experimental settings. Despite this limitation, the overall significance of the proposed research is high, with clear potential for meaningful contributions to both methodological advances and practical applications."
