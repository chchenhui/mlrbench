    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-driven and differentiable simulations, particularly in the areas of probabilistic inverse problems, neural surrogates, and uncertainty quantification. The proposed Conditional Neural Operator (CNO) framework integrates a Fourier Neural Operator with a conditional normalizing flow, exactly as outlined in the research idea. The proposal thoroughly incorporates recent literature (2023-2025) on neural operators and diffusion models for turbulent flows, referencing the CoNFiLD model, IUFNO, and diffusion-based approaches mentioned in the literature review. The methodology section clearly outlines how the proposal will address the simulation-to-real gap and uncertainty quantification challenges identified in both the task description and literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, with appropriate mathematical formulations of the FNO layers, normalizing flows, and training objectives. The experimental design is well-defined with specific tasks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The only minor areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more specific details on how the transformer-based conditioners in the normalizing flow will be implemented, and (2) further elaboration on how the approach will specifically bridge the simulation-to-real gap beyond the general statements provided. Overall, the proposal presents a coherent and understandable research plan with logical flow and minimal ambiguity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by integrating two established techniques (Fourier Neural Operators and conditional normalizing flows) in a novel way to address probabilistic inverse modeling in turbulent flows. While both FNOs and normalizing flows have been explored separately in the literature, their combination for joint learning of forward PDE solutions and posterior distributions represents a fresh approach. The end-to-end training via amortized variational inference adds another innovative element. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing methods mentioned in the literature review (particularly the diffusion-based neural operators and CoNFiLD), rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithmic components. The main innovation lies in the architecture integration and application to turbulent flow inverse problems, rather than in developing entirely new modeling paradigms."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded theoretical underpinnings. The mathematical formulations for both the FNO and normalizing flow components are correctly presented and properly integrated into the training objective using the evidence lower bound (ELBO). The experimental design includes appropriate baselines from recent literature and relevant evaluation metrics for each task. The connection to the underlying physics of turbulent flows is well-established, particularly in how the FNO's spectral properties align with turbulence modeling requirements. The proposal also acknowledges the importance of uncertainty quantification and provides a principled approach through variational inference. The only minor limitation is that the proposal could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential failure modes or theoretical limitations of the approach, particularly regarding the expressivity of the normalizing flow for complex multimodal posteriors that might arise in turbulent systems."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The use of synthetic data from Navier-Stokes simulations is practical and well-established in the field. The FNO and normalizing flow architectures have been successfully implemented in prior work, suggesting their integration is technically achievable. The experimental tasks are well-defined and appropriately scoped. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the computational resources required for training on high-resolution 3D turbulent flow simulations could be substantial, and the proposal doesn't address computational requirements in detail; (2) the expected speedup of 10^3-10^4× over MCMC methods is ambitious and may be challenging to achieve while maintaining posterior fidelity; (3) the proposal doesn't fully address how the model will handle the potential ill-posedness of inverse problems in turbulent flows, where multiple parameter configurations might lead to similar observations. Despite these concerns, the overall approach appears implementable with current technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant challenge in computational fluid dynamics and scientific machine learning more broadly. Fast, accurate, and uncertainty-aware inverse modeling for turbulent flows has wide-ranging applications in aerospace engineering, climate modeling, and energy systems. The potential impact is substantial: (1) enabling real-time inversion could transform experimental workflows in fields like plasma physics; (2) the differentiability of the approach enables gradient-based optimization for design tasks that are currently computationally prohibitive; (3) the uncertainty quantification addresses a critical gap in current surrogate modeling approaches. The proposal clearly articulates these benefits and connects them to broader scientific workflows. The significance is further enhanced by the commitment to open science through the release of datasets, code, and pre-trained models. While the immediate applications focus on fluid dynamics, the methodological contributions could extend to other PDE-governed systems, amplifying the potential impact."
