    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on Bayesian decision-making and uncertainty by proposing LLM-guided prior elicitation for Bayesian Optimization. The methodology comprehensively covers how LLMs can extract knowledge from natural language descriptions to inform GP priors, which is consistent with the original idea. The proposal cites and builds upon relevant literature, including AutoElicit, LLAMBO, and other works mentioned in the literature review. The challenges identified in the proposal (accuracy, reliability, interpretability, and generalization) also align with those mentioned in the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that the proposal could have more explicitly addressed how it relates to some of the specific papers mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all explicitly defined. The technical formulations, including the GP model and acquisition functions, are correctly presented with appropriate mathematical notation. The experimental design section provides specific details about datasets, baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. The flow of ideas is logical, making it easy to follow the proposed approach. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for translating LLM outputs into GP parameters could be more detailed, (2) the refinement loop mentioned in section 3.4 is only briefly described without sufficient elaboration, and (3) some of the expected performance improvements (e.g., '30-50% reduction') would benefit from more justification."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by focusing specifically on using LLMs for prior elicitation in Bayesian Optimization. While the literature review indicates that similar ideas have been explored (e.g., AutoElicit, LLAMBO), this proposal offers a more comprehensive framework specifically for translating natural language descriptions into GP priors. The structured prompting strategy, chain-of-thought reasoning, and the parsing mechanism for converting LLM outputs into GP parameters represent innovative aspects. The proposal also introduces a novel refinement loop for updating priors based on new observations. However, the core concept of using LLMs to enhance BO is not entirely new, as evidenced by several papers in the literature review. The proposal builds incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The Bayesian Optimization framework is correctly formulated with appropriate mathematical notation for GPs and acquisition functions. The methodology for eliciting priors is well-grounded in both BO and LLM literature. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies to evaluate the approach. The proposal acknowledges potential limitations and includes strategies to address them, such as calibration of prior uncertainty. The chain-of-thought reasoning approach is well-justified as a means to improve reliability. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) more detailed discussion of how to handle potential LLM hallucinations or inconsistencies, (2) more rigorous theoretical analysis of how LLM-derived priors affect BO convergence guarantees, and (3) clearer specification of how to validate the quality of the elicited priors independently of the final optimization performance."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. Both Bayesian Optimization and LLMs are well-established technologies with mature implementations available. The experimental design includes both synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks that are reasonable to implement. The baselines are appropriate and comparable. However, there are some implementation challenges: (1) designing effective prompts that reliably extract the right information from LLMs requires significant engineering and validation, (2) parsing LLM outputs into structured GP priors may be error-prone and require robust error handling, (3) the refinement loop mentioned briefly may be complex to implement effectively, and (4) the real-world tasks (especially material design) may require domain expertise and specialized resources. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of potential failure modes and mitigation strategies. Overall, while feasible, successful implementation will require careful engineering and validation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in Bayesian Optimization: the need for informative priors to improve efficiency, especially in high-dimensional or sparse-data regimes. If successful, the approach could significantly reduce the number of function evaluations needed for convergence, which is particularly valuable in domains where evaluations are expensive (e.g., drug discovery, material design). The potential to democratize BO by enabling non-experts to specify priors through natural language is particularly impactful. The proposal aligns well with the workshop's focus on enhancing Bayesian methods with frontier models like LLMs. The expected outcomes include both methodological advances and practical applications across multiple domains. The broader implications for scientific discovery and AI democratization are well-articulated. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the advance relative to existing work combining LLMs and BO, and the proposal could more clearly differentiate its unique contributions from prior art."
