    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on Bayesian decision-making and uncertainty by proposing a novel integration of LLMs with Bayesian Optimization to improve prior elicitation. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the core idea of using LLMs to generate informative priors based on natural language descriptions of optimization problems. It also effectively references and builds upon the literature review, acknowledging works like AutoElicit, LLAMBO, and other relevant papers while clearly positioning its unique contribution in the space. The methodology is consistent with both the task requirements and the proposed idea, focusing specifically on prior elicitation rather than other aspects of BO where LLMs could be integrated."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research problem, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all presented in a logical and coherent manner. The technical aspects of Bayesian Optimization and the role of the LLM in prior elicitation are explained with appropriate detail and precision. The experimental design is thoroughly described, including baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for translating LLM outputs into formal GP priors could be more precisely specified, particularly how the hyperparameter ranges will be converted to prior distributions; (2) the proposal could more explicitly address how it will handle potential inconsistencies or errors in LLM outputs; and (3) some technical formulations (e.g., in the acquisition function section) could be more thoroughly explained for non-expert readers."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to addressing a significant challenge in Bayesian Optimization - the specification of informative priors. While the literature review indicates that similar ideas are being explored (e.g., papers 5-9 in the review), this proposal offers a more systematic and comprehensive framework specifically focused on using LLMs to interpret natural language problem descriptions for GP prior specification. The novelty lies in the specific focus on the initial prior specification rather than integrating LLMs within the BO loop (as in LLAMBO) or for generating initial points (as in Zeng et al.). The proposal acknowledges concurrent work in this direction but aims to provide a more rigorous methodology and evaluation. However, the core concept of using LLMs for prior elicitation is not entirely groundbreaking, as evidenced by several papers in the literature review exploring similar ideas, which somewhat limits the novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The Bayesian Optimization framework is correctly formulated, with appropriate mathematical notation and understanding of GP surrogate models, acquisition functions, and the role of priors. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-chosen baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics that will allow for robust validation of the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and limitations, such as LLM reliability and the need for proper evaluation of the generated priors. The methodology for integrating LLM-generated priors into the BO loop is technically sound. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) more detailed discussion of how to validate the quality of LLM-generated priors beyond just optimization performance; (2) consideration of how to handle cases where LLMs generate inconsistent or physically implausible priors; and (3) more rigorous statistical analysis plans for comparing performance across methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed research is highly feasible with current technology and resources. All the components required - LLMs, Bayesian Optimization frameworks, and benchmark optimization problems - are readily available. The approach does not require specialized hardware beyond what is typically needed for running LLMs and BO. The experimental design is realistic and well-scoped, with a clear progression from synthetic benchmarks to simulated real-world problems. The proposal also outlines a practical implementation plan with specific steps for the LLM-based prior elicitation module and its integration with standard BO. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the reliability of LLMs in consistently generating useful priors across different problem descriptions may vary; (2) the proposal may underestimate the challenges in parsing and interpreting LLM outputs into formal prior specifications; and (3) obtaining truly informative natural language descriptions for benchmark problems might be challenging and could introduce experimenter bias."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant challenge in Bayesian Optimization - the difficulty of specifying informative priors, which is a major bottleneck for practitioners. If successful, this research could substantially improve the efficiency of BO in expensive optimization scenarios, potentially reducing the number of required function evaluations and making BO more accessible to non-experts. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on enhancing Bayesian methods with frontier models like LLMs. The potential impact spans multiple domains where BO is applied, including scientific discovery, engineering design, and hyperparameter tuning. The proposal also contributes to the broader field of human-AI collaboration by leveraging natural language as an interface between domain expertise and formal mathematical models. While the significance is high, it is somewhat limited by the fact that prior specification is just one aspect of BO efficiency, and improvements here may have diminishing returns in some applications where other factors dominate performance."
