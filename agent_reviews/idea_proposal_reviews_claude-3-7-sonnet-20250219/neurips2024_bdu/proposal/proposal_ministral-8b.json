    "Consistency": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It addresses the workshop's focus on Bayesian decision-making and uncertainty, specifically targeting the challenge of prior specification in Bayesian Optimization. The proposal follows the core idea of using LLMs to elicit informative priors for BO and incorporates the literature review's insights about LLM integration with Bayesian methods. The methodology includes benchmark and real-world experiments as suggested in the original idea. However, it could have more explicitly addressed some of the key challenges identified in the literature review, such as interpretability of LLM-generated priors and domain-specific knowledge integration."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is exceptionally clear and well-structured. It presents a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and well-defined. The methodology section clearly outlines the data collection process, the LLM-based prior elicitation approach, and the evaluation metrics. The experimental design is structured in three distinct phases with clear purposes. The expected outcomes and impact are articulated concisely. The proposal uses appropriate technical language while remaining accessible, making the research plan easy to understand and follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by focusing on the specific application of LLMs for prior elicitation in Bayesian Optimization. While the literature review shows that similar ideas have been explored (e.g., AutoElicit, LLAMBO), this proposal offers a fresh perspective by focusing specifically on the prior elicitation component rather than the entire BO process. The approach of using natural language descriptions of optimization problems to generate GP hyperparameters is innovative. However, it shares similarities with existing approaches in the literature and doesn't propose fundamentally new theoretical frameworks or algorithms that would make it groundbreaking. The novelty lies more in the specific application and implementation details rather than in conceptual innovation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and based on established theoretical foundations in Bayesian Optimization and language models. The methodology is well-justified and follows logical steps from data collection to evaluation. The evaluation metrics are appropriate for assessing the performance of the proposed method. However, there are some gaps in the technical rigor. The proposal lacks detailed discussion of how the LLM outputs will be translated into specific GP prior parameters, which is a critical technical component. It also doesn't address potential failure modes or how to handle cases where LLM-generated priors might be misleading. Additionally, there's limited discussion of statistical validation methods to ensure the reliability of results. While the overall approach is sound, these technical details would strengthen the proposal's rigor."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current technology and resources. Both Bayesian Optimization and Large Language Models are well-established technologies with accessible implementations. The experimental design is practical and can be implemented with standard computational resources. The benchmark optimization tasks mentioned are standard and readily available. The evaluation metrics are measurable and quantifiable. The three-phase experimental design provides a clear roadmap for implementation. The only moderate challenges might be in accessing domain-specific datasets for real-world applications and in developing effective prompting strategies for the LLMs to generate useful prior information. Overall, the research plan is realistic and achievable within a reasonable timeframe."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important challenge in Bayesian Optimization - the specification of informative priors - which directly impacts BO's efficiency and effectiveness in real-world applications. Successfully automating prior elicitation would make BO more accessible to non-experts and potentially reduce the computational cost of optimization in expensive domains like drug discovery and material design. This aligns well with the workshop's focus on enhancing Bayesian decision-making. The potential impact spans multiple domains including hyperparameter tuning, scientific discovery, and material design. The proposal also contributes to the broader integration of LLMs with probabilistic modeling techniques. While not completely transformative of the field, it represents a significant advancement that could substantially improve practical applications of Bayesian Optimization."
