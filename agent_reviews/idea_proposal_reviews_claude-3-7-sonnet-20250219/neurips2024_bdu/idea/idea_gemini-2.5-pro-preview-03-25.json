        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on Bayesian decision-making and uncertainty. It directly addresses the workshop's emphasis on incorporating prior knowledge into Bayesian methods and leveraging frontier models (specifically LLMs) to enhance Bayesian approaches. The proposal targets Bayesian Optimization, which is explicitly mentioned as a relevant area in the workshop description. The idea also connects to the workshop's interest in applications like scientific discovery and hyperparameter tuning, where uncertainty quantification is crucial. The only minor gap is that while the workshop emphasizes decision-making under uncertainty, the proposal focuses more on prior elicitation than on the decision-making aspects of BO."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (difficulty in specifying informative priors for BO), the proposed solution (using LLMs to elicit priors based on natural language descriptions), and the expected benefits (faster convergence through more informed exploration). The evaluation approach is also well-defined, comparing function evaluation efficiency against standard priors. However, some minor ambiguities remain: the exact mechanism for translating LLM outputs into prior parameters could be more precisely defined, and the specific types of natural language descriptions that would be used as inputs (e.g., their source, structure, and required detail level) could be further elaborated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by bridging two powerful paradigms: Bayesian Optimization and Large Language Models. While both LLMs and BO are well-established individually, their integration for prior elicitation represents a fresh approach. The concept of using natural language descriptions to inform Bayesian priors is particularly innovative, as it could make BO more accessible to domain experts without statistical expertise. The approach differs from standard automated prior selection methods by leveraging the vast knowledge embedded in LLMs. However, it builds upon existing work in both automated prior selection and LLM applications, rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, which prevents it from receiving the highest novelty score."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology and methods. Both LLMs and BO frameworks are readily available, making implementation straightforward from a technical perspective. However, there are moderate challenges to address: (1) ensuring LLMs can reliably translate domain knowledge into appropriate prior parameters without introducing biases, (2) developing effective prompting strategies to extract relevant information for prior construction, (3) validating that the LLM-generated priors actually improve optimization performance consistently across different problem domains. These challenges are substantial but surmountable with careful experimental design and evaluation. The proposal would benefit from more details on how to handle cases where LLM-generated priors might be misleading."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses an important limitation in Bayesian Optimization - the difficulty in specifying informative priors, especially for non-experts. If successful, it could significantly broaden BO's accessibility and applicability across various domains where function evaluations are expensive (e.g., drug discovery, materials science, hyperparameter tuning). The potential impact is substantial as it could reduce the number of required function evaluations, saving considerable resources in scientific discovery and engineering optimization tasks. The approach also represents a meaningful step toward more intuitive interfaces for sophisticated Bayesian methods. However, the impact might be somewhat limited to scenarios where relevant domain knowledge can be effectively extracted from text, and may not generalize to entirely novel problem domains where even LLMs lack relevant knowledge."
