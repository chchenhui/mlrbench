    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description. It directly addresses the workshop's central question of 'what do we need for successful domain generalization?' by proposing cross-modal invariance learning as a source of additional information to improve DG. The idea specifically targets two key topics mentioned in the workshop: 'exploiting multiple modalities to achieve robustness to distribution shift' and 'frameworks for specifying known invariances.' The proposal acknowledges the workshop's observation that existing DG methods underperform against baselines and offers a concrete approach to overcome this limitation through multi-modal data. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly discuss domain-level metadata or causal modeling aspects mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (domain generalization limitations), the proposed solution (cross-modal invariance learning with jointly normalized representations), and the implementation approach (modality-specific encoders, adversarial domain-adaptation, and cross-modal contrastive learning). The three-step framework is well-structured and logical. The evaluation plan on medical imaging and autonomous driving datasets is specified. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific normalization techniques for creating the joint normalized representations, the exact architecture of the adversarial domain-adaptation component, and how the fusion of multi-modal features will be implemented. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to domain generalization. The concept of using cross-modal consistency as a supervisory signal for domain invariance is relatively fresh, especially the focus on jointly normalized representations across modalities. While multi-modal learning and domain adaptation are established fields, their combination specifically for domain generalization with the proposed normalization and alignment techniques appears to offer a novel perspective. However, components like adversarial domain adaptation and contrastive learning are well-established techniques, and similar ideas of leveraging complementary information across modalities have been explored in related contexts, though perhaps not with this specific formulation for domain generalization. The idea builds upon existing concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. All the components mentioned (modality-specific encoders, adversarial domain adaptation, contrastive learning, and representation normalization) are established techniques with available implementations. The datasets mentioned (medical imaging and autonomous driving) are accessible for research. The computational requirements, while potentially substantial for multi-modal learning, are within the capabilities of modern research infrastructure. The three-step framework is clearly defined and implementable. The only potential challenges might be in fine-tuning the balance between modality alignment and domain invariance, and ensuring that the jointly normalized representations preserve enough discriminative information for the downstream classification task. These are manageable research challenges rather than fundamental feasibility issues."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant problem in machine learning: improving domain generalization, which is crucial for deploying ML systems in real-world environments. The potential impact is substantial across multiple fields, particularly in the critical applications mentioned (medical imaging and autonomous driving) where distribution shifts can severely impact performance and safety. If successful, this approach could provide a general framework for leveraging multi-modal data to improve robustness across domains, addressing a known limitation in current DG methods. The significance is enhanced by the fact that the approach doesn't require additional data collection but rather better utilizes existing multi-modal data. The idea could influence how multi-modal systems are designed for robust performance. It doesn't receive the highest score because similar benefits might be achievable through other approaches to robustness, and the impact may be limited to scenarios where multi-modal data is available."
