        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's central question of what is needed for successful domain generalization by proposing that domain-level metadata can be leveraged for causal discovery to identify invariant mechanisms. The proposal incorporates all key aspects mentioned in the research idea, including causal structure discovery, representation learning for invariant features, and validation on benchmarks like DomainBed. It builds upon the literature review by citing and extending works like the Contrastive Causal Model (arXiv:2210.02655) and CIRL (arXiv:2203.14237), while addressing the identified challenges of integrating causal discovery with representation learning. The methodology thoroughly explains how domain-level metadata will be used to infer causal graphs and enforce invariance through constraint-based optimization, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus on leveraging additional information for domain generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to evaluation. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the three-stage framework (causal discovery, representation learning, experimental validation) is well-defined. The mathematical formulations are precise and properly explained, particularly the formalization of causal factors satisfying p(Y|C) invariance across domains. The algorithmic steps for each stage are detailed with specific techniques and implementation strategies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact procedure for counterfactual validation of causal candidates could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the inferred causal graph and the neural network architecture could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'ancestral sets') are used without full explanation. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible but has minor areas that could be refined for complete clarity."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating causal discovery with domain-aware representation learning in a comprehensive framework. The approach of using domain labels as metadata for causal graph inference and then enforcing causal invariance through differentiable constraints is innovative. The three-stage methodology combining causal discovery, representation learning with causal constraints, and experimental validation offers a fresh perspective on domain generalization. However, many of the individual components build upon existing methods: the causal discovery algorithms (PC algorithm, NOTEARS), mutual information estimation (InfoNCE), and contrastive learning are established techniques. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines prior work like CIRL (arXiv:2203.14237) and Contrastive Causal Model (arXiv:2210.02655). The novelty lies primarily in the integration and application of these methods within a unified framework specifically designed for domain generalization, rather than in proposing entirely new algorithmic approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical frameworks. The causal modeling approach is based on solid principles from structural causal models and counterfactual reasoning. The mathematical formulations for causal invariance loss, feature splitting, and counterfactual consistency are correctly specified and align with causal inference theory. The identifiability assumptions (causal sufficiency, faithfulness, domain-dependent noise) are clearly stated and justified. The generalization guarantees provide a theoretical foundation for why the approach should work. The methodology carefully addresses potential challenges in causal discovery and representation learning, with appropriate techniques selected for each component. The experimental design includes proper baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some minor limitations: (1) the assumption of causal sufficiency may be too strong for real-world applications, (2) the approach to handle latent causal variables could be more thoroughly developed, and (3) the theoretical analysis could more explicitly connect the mutual information minimization to improved generalization bounds."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it requires moderate refinement and optimization. The implementation strategy is well-thought-out, with specific tools mentioned (CausalDiscoveryToolbox, PyTorch) and a clear timeline for development. The three-stage methodology breaks down the complex problem into manageable components. The datasets and benchmarks (DomainBed, nuScenes, medical imaging) are appropriate and accessible. However, there are several implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) accurate causal discovery from observational data is notoriously difficult, especially in high-dimensional spaces like images, (2) the computational complexity of causal discovery algorithms may limit scalability to large datasets, (3) differentiable approximations of mutual information can be unstable during training, and (4) the approach assumes access to domain labels which may not always be available or well-defined. The timeline of 10 months seems reasonable but potentially tight given the complexity of integrating causal discovery with deep learning frameworks."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in machine learning: the challenge of domain generalization, which is crucial for deploying models in real-world settings where distribution shifts are common. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) Theoretical advancement by formalizing the connection between causal invariance and domain generalization, (2) Practical applications in high-stakes domains like medical imaging and autonomous driving where robustness is critical, (3) Methodological contribution by bridging causal inference and deep learning, and (4) Empirical insights into what additional information is needed for successful domain generalization. If successful, the approach could significantly outperform current methods on benchmarks and provide a principled framework for addressing distribution shifts. The broader impact on high-stakes AI deployment is particularly noteworthy. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on scenarios where domain labels are available, which may not cover all domain generalization challenges."
