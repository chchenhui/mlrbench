    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of improving robustness in few-shot learning settings with foundation models, which is the core focus of the R0-FoMo workshop. The Meta-APP framework specifically targets adversarial robustness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios, incorporating elements from the research idea such as meta-learning for adversarial prompt perturbations. The methodology builds upon the literature review, citing and extending works like StyleAdv (Fu et al. 2023), LCAT (Liu et al. 2021), and recent adversarial prompt learning approaches (Zhou et al. 2024; White & Brown 2023). The proposal also addresses the task's emphasis on leveraging unlabeled data through its semi-supervised adversarial training component."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with detailed algorithms. The technical formulations, including the meta-objective and robust fine-tuning loss, are precisely defined with appropriate mathematical notation. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, baselines, metrics, and attack protocols. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact architecture of the generator G_φ could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the meta-learning phase and the fine-tuning phase could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'first-order MAML') are used without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with meta-learning literature."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The meta-learning approach to generate universal adversarial prompt perturbations is innovative and distinguishes itself from prior work. While adversarial training and meta-learning have been explored separately (as noted in the literature review), their combination for prompt-based few-shot learning in foundation models represents a novel direction. The integration of unlabeled data through a semi-supervised consistency loss is also innovative in the context of adversarial robustness for few-shot learning. The proposal clearly differentiates itself from existing approaches like StyleAdv and LCAT by focusing specifically on prompt perturbations rather than general adversarial examples, and by targeting foundation models rather than traditional neural networks. However, it builds incrementally on existing meta-learning and adversarial training concepts rather than introducing entirely new paradigms."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The meta-learning framework is well-grounded in MAML principles, and the adversarial training objective follows standard practices in the field. The semi-supervised consistency loss is theoretically justified for aligning predictions across clean and perturbed inputs. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the convergence properties of the meta-learning algorithm are not analyzed, (2) there's limited discussion of potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, (3) the choice of KL divergence for the consistency loss is not fully justified compared to alternatives, and (4) the theoretical guarantees for robustness improvement are not provided. Additionally, while the experimental design is comprehensive, the evaluation metrics could be more rigorously defined, particularly for measuring calibration error under adversarial conditions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The specified hardware (4×A100 GPUs) and training parameters are appropriate for the scale of the experiments. The use of existing foundation models (GPT-3, CLIP) and datasets (SST-2, AGNews, QNLI, ImageNet) is practical. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) accessing GPT-3 through APIs for extensive adversarial training might be costly and face rate limitations, (2) the meta-learning phase could be computationally intensive across multiple tasks, (3) generating effective adversarial prompts that transfer across tasks is challenging and may require more iterations than estimated, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address potential challenges in optimizing the balance between clean accuracy and robustness (the λ parameter). While the overall approach is implementable, these practical challenges might require adjustments to the methodology or experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the field: enhancing robustness of foundation models in few-shot learning settings. This is highly significant given the increasing deployment of such models in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal applications. The expected outcomes—15-20% improvement in robust accuracy with minimal clean accuracy degradation—would represent a substantial advancement. The meta-learning approach to generate universal adversarial perturbations could have broad impact beyond the specific tasks studied, potentially generalizing to other foundation models and applications. The proposal also contributes to the broader goal of responsible AI by making foundation models more reliable under adversarial conditions. The planned open-source contributions (code, adversarial prompt libraries, pretrained weights) would further amplify the impact by enabling other researchers to build upon this work. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on specific types of adversarial attacks rather than addressing the full spectrum of robustness challenges faced by foundation models."
