    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on spurious correlations and shortcut learning by proposing AIFS as a novel solution that works without requiring group annotations. The methodology is consistent with the original idea of using synthetic interventions in latent space to discover and neutralize spurious correlations. The proposal cites and builds upon relevant literature mentioned in the review, including works on group robustness [1], causal representation learning [6,7], and gradient-based attribution [8]. The experimental design includes datasets mentioned in the literature review (like Waterbirds) and compares against appropriate baselines like GroupDRO, SPUME, and ElRep. The proposal's focus on modality-agnostic solutions and foundations of spurious correlations aligns perfectly with the workshop's objectives."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem and positions AIFS within existing literature. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the framework with clear mathematical formulations of the intervention module and dual-objective loss. The figures referenced (though not visible in the provided text) would likely enhance understanding. The experimental design is well-specified with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes and broader impact sections clearly communicate the anticipated contributions. Minor areas for improvement include: (1) further elaboration on how the sensitivity scores specifically identify spurious rather than causal features, and (2) more details on the implementation of the Gumbel-Softmax sampler for mask selection. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible with only minor points requiring additional clarification."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "AIFS presents a novel approach to addressing spurious correlations through several innovative components. The combination of gradient-based sensitivity analysis with synthetic interventions in latent space represents a fresh perspective not fully explored in the cited literature. Unlike SPUME [3] or RaVL [5], which rely on vision-language models or region-aware losses, AIFS operates directly on latent representations without requiring group annotations or domain-specific knowledge. The closed-loop adaptation mechanism that iteratively updates sensitivity scores and intervention masks is particularly innovative. The dual-objective loss that simultaneously enforces invariance and penalizes sensitivity to perturbed features is also a novel contribution. While individual components like gradient attribution and invariance learning exist in prior work, their integration into a unified, adaptive framework represents a significant advancement. The proposal could have scored higher if it had more explicitly differentiated its approach from recent works on causal representation learning [6,7]."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for sensitivity scores, intervention masks, and the dual-objective loss are well-defined and logically consistent. The approach draws appropriately from established concepts in gradient attribution, invariance learning, and representation learning. The experimental design includes relevant datasets and appropriate baselines for comparison. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The assumption that high-sensitivity dimensions correspond to spurious features needs stronger theoretical justification, as high sensitivity could also indicate causal features; (2) The proposal doesn't fully address potential issues with the stochasticity of the intervention process and its impact on training stability; (3) The relationship between the mask selection process and the actual causal structure of the data could be more rigorously established. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with reasonable implementation requirements. The components of AIFS—pretrained encoders, intervention modules, and dual-objective losses—can be implemented using standard deep learning frameworks. The experimental design uses established datasets and metrics, making evaluation straightforward. The computational requirements appear manageable, especially since the intervention module is described as lightweight. However, several practical challenges may affect implementation: (1) The periodic recomputation of sensitivity scores and mask updates could introduce training instability or convergence issues; (2) The hyperparameter selection (e.g., perturbation magnitude σ, mask size k, recomputation frequency T) may require extensive tuning; (3) The approach may face challenges in high-dimensional latent spaces where identifying the most relevant dimensions becomes more difficult. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed discussion of these potential implementation challenges and strategies to address them. Nevertheless, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "AIFS addresses a critical problem in machine learning—the reliance on spurious correlations—with significant potential impact. The proposal's significance stems from several factors: (1) It offers a solution to the challenging problem of identifying and mitigating unknown spurious correlations without requiring group annotations, addressing a major limitation of existing approaches; (2) Its modality-agnostic nature makes it applicable across diverse domains including image, tabular, and multimodal data; (3) The framework provides insights into the mechanistic origins of shortcut learning, contributing to the foundational understanding called for in the workshop description; (4) The potential applications in high-stakes domains like medical diagnosis and autonomous systems highlight its real-world relevance. The expected improvements in worst-group accuracy and robustness gap would represent meaningful advances over current methods. The proposal could have scored higher if it had more explicitly quantified the potential impact on specific real-world applications or provided preliminary results demonstrating the approach's effectiveness."
