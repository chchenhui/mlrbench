        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on spurious correlations and shortcut learning by proposing a novel framework (AIFS) that automatically discovers and neutralizes spurious correlations without requiring explicit annotations. The methodology aligns perfectly with the research idea of using synthetic interventions in latent space to promote invariant predictions. The proposal also incorporates insights from the literature review, building upon recent work on feature reweighting (Hameed et al., 2024), elastic representations (Wen et al., 2024), and intervention-based approaches while addressing the key challenge of identifying spurious features without supervision. The experimental design includes relevant benchmarks mentioned in the literature review, such as Waterbirds and CelebA, and compares against appropriate baselines like GroupDRO and ElRep."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical formulations are presented with appropriate mathematical notation and explained in sufficient detail. The framework components, training objectives, and adaptive mask update mechanism are all well-defined. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are comprehensively outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact relationship between the intervention strength parameter σ and the mask values m could be more explicitly defined, (2) the process for normalizing attribution scores in the mask update step could be more precisely specified, and (3) some concrete examples of how the framework would operate on specific datasets would enhance understanding. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The AIFS framework presents a novel approach to addressing spurious correlations through several innovative components. The adaptive intervention mechanism that dynamically identifies and targets latent dimensions corresponding to spurious features is particularly original. Unlike existing methods such as ElRep (Wen et al., 2024) that apply penalties to the entire representation or approaches like those from Izmailov et al. (2022) that focus only on the last layer, AIFS introduces a more fine-grained intervention at the latent dimension level. The combination of synthetic interventions with an attribution-based mask update mechanism represents a fresh approach to the problem. The proposal also innovates by integrating concepts from causal inference (interventions) with representation learning in a unified framework. While some individual components build upon existing work in invariant prediction and feature attribution, their integration into a cohesive, adaptive framework that requires no group annotations represents a significant advancement over current approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The multi-objective training approach with classification, invariance, and sensitivity losses is well-justified and mathematically formulated. The attribution analysis for identifying important latent dimensions is grounded in established gradient-based attribution methods. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the theoretical guarantees that the intervention process will indeed target spurious rather than causal features are not fully established, (2) the convergence properties of the adaptive mask update mechanism could be more rigorously analyzed, and (3) the relationship between the proposed interventions and causal concepts like counterfactuals could be more formally developed. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate baselines and metrics, but would benefit from power analyses or sample size justifications. Overall, while the approach is technically sound, some theoretical aspects could be strengthened to provide more rigorous guarantees."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The AIFS framework appears largely feasible to implement with current technology and methods. The components of the framework—pretrained encoders, intervention modules, attribution mechanisms—all utilize established techniques in deep learning. The computational requirements, while higher than standard training due to the intervention process and periodic attribution analysis, remain within reasonable bounds for modern computing resources. The proposal acknowledges this computational overhead as a limitation. The experimental design using existing datasets with known spurious correlations (Waterbirds, CelebA, modified MNIST) is practical and achievable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) the sensitivity of the framework to hyperparameter choices (λ_inv, λ_sens, β, γ) may require extensive tuning, (2) the attribution analysis on validation sets adds complexity to the training loop, and (3) the adaptive adjustment of intervention strength based on performance differences might lead to instability in some cases. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they do increase the implementation complexity and may require careful engineering to ensure stable performance across different datasets and model architectures."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The AIFS framework addresses a critical problem in machine learning—the reliance on spurious correlations—that has significant implications for model reliability, fairness, and safety. The proposal's significance lies in its potential to automatically discover and mitigate spurious correlations without requiring explicit annotations, which addresses a major limitation of existing approaches. If successful, this research could impact multiple domains: (1) healthcare, where diagnostic models could make more reliable predictions for underrepresented patient groups; (2) autonomous systems that need to generalize to novel environments; (3) NLP applications where avoiding stereotypical associations is crucial; and (4) financial services where fair risk assessment is essential. The framework also contributes to the theoretical understanding of how deep networks encode causal versus spurious information in their latent spaces. The proposal's approach to bridging causal inference and representation learning could influence future research directions in robust machine learning. While the immediate practical impact depends on successful implementation and validation across diverse domains, the potential significance for both theoretical advancement and practical applications is substantial."
