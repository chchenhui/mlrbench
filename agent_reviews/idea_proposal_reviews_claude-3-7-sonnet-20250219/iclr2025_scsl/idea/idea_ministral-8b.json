        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description, specifically addressing the need for 'automated methods for detecting spurious correlations' which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop objectives. The proposal focuses on multimodal data, which is listed as a topic of interest in the workshop. The idea incorporates contrastive learning approaches and aims to create evaluation benchmarks, both of which are mentioned in the workshop topics. However, it doesn't fully address some aspects of the workshop, such as exploring the foundations of spurious correlations or investigating the phenomenon in large language models specifically, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure that outlines the motivation, main idea, methodology, and expected outcomes. The five-step methodology provides a good overview of the approach. However, there are some ambiguities that could be clarified. For instance, the 'novel algorithm' for detecting spurious correlations is mentioned without specific details on how it would work. Similarly, the proposal mentions comparing learned representations against 'known spurious patterns' but doesn't explain how these patterns would be identified or defined in the first place. These ambiguities prevent the idea from receiving a higher clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea combines existing techniques (contrastive learning, self-supervised learning) in a potentially new way to address the problem of spurious correlations in multimodal data. While the application to multimodal data adds some novelty, the core techniques mentioned are well-established. The proposal mentions a 'novel algorithm' for spurious correlation detection, but without specific details on what makes this algorithm innovative. The creation of new benchmarks for evaluating spurious correlation detection is valuable but not groundbreaking. The idea represents an incremental advancement rather than a revolutionary approach to the problem."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed research appears largely feasible with existing technologies and methods. Contrastive learning and self-supervised learning are established techniques with available implementations. Creating evaluation benchmarks is a well-understood process. However, there are some challenges that might affect feasibility. Detecting spurious correlations automatically is inherently difficult, especially without human-defined notions of what constitutes 'spurious.' The proposal doesn't fully address how to identify spurious patterns without prior knowledge, which could be a significant implementation challenge. Additionally, ensuring the framework works across diverse multimodal datasets might require substantial computational resources and domain expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research addresses a critical problem in AI: the detection and mitigation of spurious correlations that lead to unfair or unreliable systems. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus and has broad implications for improving AI robustness and fairness. The potential impact is significant across multiple domains, including healthcare and social media, where biased AI decisions can have serious consequences. The creation of benchmarks would also benefit the wider research community. However, without more specific technical innovations or a clearer path to addressing the fundamental challenges of spurious correlation detection, the transformative potential is somewhat limited compared to what would merit a perfect score."
