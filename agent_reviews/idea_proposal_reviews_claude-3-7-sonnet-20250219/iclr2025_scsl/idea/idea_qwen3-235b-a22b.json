        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on spurious correlations and shortcut learning. It directly addresses the workshop's call for 'introducing new spurious correlation benchmarks' and 'proposing new robustification methods' in the medical imaging domain. The idea specifically targets the workshop's concern about models relying on spurious patterns rather than causal relationships, and it proposes a benchmark that explicitly disentangles core and spurious features. The focus on medical imaging also addresses the workshop's interest in 'specific applications (medical...)' and the concern about 'under-represented groups or minority populations' who could be harmed by these biases in healthcare settings."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The proposal specifies concrete examples (diabetic retinopathy detection, imaging device profiles as spurious features) and outlines a three-part methodology (controlled corruption, counterfactual evaluation, and robustness metrics). The approach using GANs for feature factorization is clearly stated. The only minor ambiguities are in the technical details of how exactly the GAN-based factorization would work in practice and how the counterfactual datasets would be constructed and validated, which prevents it from scoring a 9 or 10."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by combining several existing concepts in a new way. While GANs, counterfactual testing, and spurious correlation detection are not new individually, the proposal to create a synthetic medical imaging benchmark with explicit factorization of spurious and core features offers a fresh approach. The focus on medical imaging adds domain-specific novelty. However, similar approaches have been explored in other domains, and the use of GANs for controlled feature manipulation is an extension of existing techniques rather than a fundamentally new method, which is why it doesn't score higher."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The idea is somewhat feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Creating realistic medical images with GANs that properly disentangle spurious from core features is technically challenging and requires domain expertise. Ensuring that the synthetic data maintains clinical relevance while allowing controlled manipulation of features presents a significant hurdle. Additionally, validating that the generated counterfactual examples are medically plausible would require clinical expertise. The proposal is implementable with current technology, but would require considerable resources, expertise, and careful validation, which is why it receives a moderate feasibility score."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in medical AI where the stakes of model failures are particularly high. Creating benchmarks that explicitly control for spurious correlations would significantly advance the field's ability to develop and evaluate robust models. The potential impact extends beyond the specific use case to the broader challenge of developing trustworthy AI for healthcare. The work could lead to methodological advances applicable to other domains and directly addresses equity concerns in AI deployment. The significance is high because it tackles a problem with real-world consequences for patient care and health equity, though it's focused on benchmark creation rather than deploying solutions in clinical settings."
