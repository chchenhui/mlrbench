    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric AI approaches for foundation models, particularly targeting safety and alignment issues. The methodology builds upon the referenced literature, incorporating elements from Safety Pretraining's data filtering, Safer-Instruct's automated preference data, RAFT's reward-based fine-tuning, and CoSA's controllable safety alignment. The proposal maintains consistency throughout, with clear connections between the initial motivation, the detailed methodology, and the expected outcomes. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges related to data bias, the proposal focuses more on toxicity and safety than on addressing bias specifically."
    },
    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the four-stage methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate technical details. The mathematical formulations for the reward function and RL algorithm are precisely defined. The experimental design includes specific datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for updating the reward model based on human feedback could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between batch selection and model training could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., ASR) are used without prior definition. Overall, the proposal is highly comprehensible but has minor areas for improvement."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good novelty by integrating reinforcement learning with data curation for safety alignment—a combination that offers a fresh perspective on addressing foundation model safety. The use of a composite reward function that balances toxicity, alignment, and utility is innovative, as is the closed-loop system for iterative refinement. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing work: the RL approach resembles RAFT, the safety metrics are standard, and the data filtering concept builds on Safety Pretraining. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches. While the integration of these elements into a cohesive framework is valuable, the proposal would benefit from more groundbreaking innovations in either the reward modeling or the RL algorithm specifically designed for data curation."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The RL framework using PPO is appropriate for the optimization task, and the composite reward function logically combines relevant safety and utility metrics. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The ablation studies are well-conceived to isolate component contributions. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The iterative refinement process is grounded in established practices. The only notable limitations are: (1) potential challenges in balancing the reward components aren't fully addressed, (2) the proposal doesn't thoroughly discuss potential failure modes or limitations of the approach, and (3) there's limited discussion of how to prevent the RL agent from exploiting loopholes in the reward function. Despite these minor issues, the overall approach is technically sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation steps. The use of existing datasets (C4, Safer-Instruct), established metrics (toxicity scores, GLUE benchmarks), and proven algorithms (PPO) increases practicality. The four-stage methodology provides a clear implementation roadmap. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) the computational resources required for RL training on massive datasets could be substantial, (2) the proposal mentions human feedback for reward model updates but doesn't detail how this would be efficiently collected at scale, (3) balancing the three components of the reward function might require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and (4) the target of reducing manual intervention by >70% seems ambitious without more specific automation techniques. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present significant implementation hurdles that would need to be addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI safety and alignment with significant potential impact. If successful, the framework would provide a scalable, automated approach to data curation that could substantially improve foundation model safety while maintaining performance—addressing a key bottleneck in responsible AI development. The expected outcomes include concrete metrics (50% reduction in toxicity, <5% performance degradation) that would represent meaningful progress. The broader impacts span technical, societal, and economic dimensions, with particular value in making safety alignment more accessible to resource-constrained organizations. The work directly addresses multiple challenges identified in the literature review. The significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of some aspects of the proposal and uncertainty about how the approach would generalize beyond text to other modalities, but overall, the potential impact is substantial and well-aligned with pressing needs in the field."
