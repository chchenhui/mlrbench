    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the data-centric approach to improving foundation model safety and alignment, which is a core focus of the task description. The proposal elaborates comprehensively on the RL-guided data curation framework outlined in the research idea, maintaining fidelity to the original concept while providing substantial technical details. It also effectively incorporates and builds upon the literature review, citing all the referenced papers and extending their approaches. The proposal specifically addresses safety alignment through data curation, which aligns with the 'Data Quality, Dataset Curation' and 'Data Perspective on Safety and Ethics' areas mentioned in the task description. The only minor inconsistency is that while the task description mentions areas like data copyright and legal issues, these aspects receive relatively limited attention in the proposal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The MDP formulation for the RL framework is particularly well-articulated, with clear definitions of states, actions, transitions, and rewards. The experimental design section provides comprehensive information about datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, and implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the proxy alignment classifier and the reward model could be more explicitly defined; (2) The transition from the theoretical MDP formulation to the practical closed-loop iteration could be more seamlessly connected; and (3) Some technical terms (e.g., GAE parameter) are used without prior introduction. Despite these minor issues, the overall structure is logical and the main components of the proposal are understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a reinforcement learning approach to data curation for foundation models, which represents a fresh perspective compared to existing work. The key innovation lies in framing data selection as an MDP and using RL to learn a dynamic policy that balances safety and performance. This differs from static filtering approaches or post-training alignment methods. The proposal builds upon existing work like RAFT and Safety Pretraining but extends them by introducing a closed-loop, iterative framework that continuously refines the data selection policy based on model performance. However, while innovative, the approach shares conceptual similarities with existing RL-based methods in other domains and adapts techniques like PPO that are well-established. The composite reward function, while well-designed, follows similar principles to those used in other alignment work. Overall, the proposal offers a novel combination of existing concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The RL framework is well-grounded in established theory, with appropriate formulation of the MDP, policy learning via PPO, and reward modeling. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented, particularly the PPO objective and advantage estimation. The experimental design is comprehensive, with well-chosen baselines, evaluation metrics, and implementation details. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes mechanisms to address them, such as periodic updating of proxy classifiers. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional justification: (1) The assumption that the lightweight proxy classifiers will generalize well to the entire corpus; (2) The choice of specific hyperparameters for the PPO algorithm; and (3) The potential impact of the reward model's own biases on the curation process. Despite these minor concerns, the overall approach is technically sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with realistic implementation plans. The hardware requirements (16 A100 GPUs) are substantial but within reach for many research labs. The use of LLaMA-7B derivatives and adapters to reduce compute is a practical choice. The experimental design includes reasonable dataset sizes (~100M samples) and training schedules (5,000 iterations). The closed-loop iteration process is clearly defined and implementable. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) The computational cost of running safety detectors on millions of samples could be substantial; (2) Creating a high-quality human-labeled probe set of 5K samples requires significant annotation effort; (3) The periodic fine-tuning of the foundation model within the RL loop may be computationally expensive; and (4) The convergence of the RL policy is not guaranteed, especially given the complex reward landscape. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the approach impractical, and the proposal includes reasonable strategies to address them, such as using lightweight models and adapters."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety and alignment that has substantial real-world implications. Successfully developing an automated, scalable method for curating safer training data would significantly advance the field of responsible AI development. The expected outcomes include substantial reductions in toxicity (50-70%) and attack success rates (30-50%), which would represent meaningful improvements in model safety. The broader impact section convincingly argues that the approach could reduce human labor, accelerate deployment of aligned AI systems, and inspire a shift toward data-centric alignment methods. The modular nature of the framework allows for integration of new detectors and constraints, making it adaptable to evolving safety requirements. While the immediate impact might be limited to research environments, the long-term potential for influencing how foundation models are trained at scale is significant. The proposal also acknowledges ethical considerations and commits to transparency, which enhances its responsible impact."
