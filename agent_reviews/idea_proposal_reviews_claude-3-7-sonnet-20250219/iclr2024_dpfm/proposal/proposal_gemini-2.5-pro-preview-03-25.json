    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on data problems for foundation models, particularly in the areas of data quality, curation, and safety alignment. The DynACurE framework implements the core concept from the research idea of using reinforcement learning to guide data curation for safer foundation models. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing and building upon works like 'Safety Pretraining,' 'Safer-Instruct,' and 'RAFT' while addressing the identified challenges of data quality, scalability, alignment, evaluation, and safety-performance balance. The methodology section clearly outlines how the RL agent will learn to select training samples based on safety and alignment metrics, creating a closed-loop system as described in the original idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, problem statement, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations and a conceptual diagram that aids understanding. The experimental design, including baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics, is thoroughly specified. The writing is generally precise and professional. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the RL feedback loop with model training could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical details about the state representation and reward calculation could be further elaborated, and (3) the distinction between this approach and RAFT could be more sharply delineated in some sections."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach by applying reinforcement learning to dynamically curate training data for foundation models during the training process. While individual components (RL, safety classifiers, data filtering) have been explored in prior work, the integration into a closed-loop, adaptive system that evolves the data selection policy alongside model training represents a fresh perspective. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from static filtering approaches like 'Safety Pretraining' and from methods like RAFT that focus on generated outputs rather than input training data. However, the core techniques (PPO, toxicity classifiers, etc.) are well-established, and the novelty lies primarily in their application and integration rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The RL formulation is appropriate, with clearly defined states, actions, and rewards. The use of PPO is well-motivated given its stability and sample efficiency. The reward function design incorporates multiple dimensions (safety, alignment, utility) with appropriate weighting mechanisms. The experimental design includes comprehensive baselines and evaluation metrics that will enable rigorous assessment of the approach. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and includes ablation studies to investigate key components. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. One minor concern is that the proxy measures for alignment might not fully capture the complex, multifaceted nature of alignment with human values, but the proposal acknowledges this challenge and proposes reasonable approximations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal outlines a feasible approach with realistic implementation steps. The authors wisely propose starting with moderately sized models (1B-7B parameters) for faster iteration cycles, which enhances practicality. The use of existing tools and datasets (Perspective API, ToxiGen, etc.) further supports feasibility. The computational requirements, while substantial, are within the range of typical research projects in this domain. However, there are some implementation challenges that could affect feasibility: (1) designing effective proxy measures for alignment without extensive human feedback is difficult, (2) the closed-loop system with model fine-tuning and reward refinement introduces complexity that might require significant engineering effort, and (3) the scalability to truly large corpora (beyond the proposed 1-10B tokens) remains to be demonstrated. Overall, the approach is implementable but will require careful engineering and potentially significant computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety and alignment that has broad implications for the responsible development of foundation models. If successful, DynACurE could provide a scalable, automated approach to data curation that significantly reduces harmful outputs from foundation models while preserving their core capabilities. This directly addresses the workshop's focus on data-centric approaches to safety, alignment, and efficiency. The expected outcomes include not just a functional framework but also empirical validation of safer models and characterization of important trade-offs between safety and utility. The approach could influence how future foundation models are trained, moving beyond post-hoc alignment to embedding safety considerations during the training process itself. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on fine-tuning rather than pre-training from scratch, but the principles could potentially extend to full pre-training scenarios as well."
