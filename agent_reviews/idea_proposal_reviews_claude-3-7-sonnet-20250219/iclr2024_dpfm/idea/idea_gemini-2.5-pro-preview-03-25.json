        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, addressing the data-centric AI focus and specifically targeting data problems for Foundation Models. It directly addresses data curation and selection for continual learning, which falls under 'Data Quality, Dataset Curation' and 'Data Perspective to Efficiency' areas mentioned in the task. The proposal aims to improve efficiency in updating FMs while maintaining performance, which is a core concern highlighted in the workshop overview. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other interested areas like safety, ethics, or copyright issues."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement (computational cost and catastrophic forgetting in continual learning), a specific proposed solution (influence-based data selection), and expected outcomes (reduced computational cost while preserving capabilities). The methodology involving influence functions and gradient-based metrics is specified, though some technical details about how these influence scores would be efficiently approximated for large-scale FMs could be further elaborated. The overall flow from motivation to approach to expected outcomes is logical and easy to follow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines established concepts (influence functions, continual learning, data selection) in a novel way specifically for Foundation Models. While influence functions have been used for data selection in smaller models, applying them to the continual learning problem in massive FMs represents a fresh approach. The innovation lies in adapting these techniques to address the specific challenges of FMs (scale, catastrophic forgetting) rather than proposing an entirely new method. The approach of using influence metrics to simultaneously optimize for new knowledge acquisition while minimizing forgetting is particularly innovative, though builds upon existing work in continual learning."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility faces some significant challenges. Computing exact influence functions for Foundation Models would be computationally prohibitive due to their size, requiring approximations that might compromise accuracy. The proposal acknowledges this by mentioning 'an efficient method to approximate these influence scores,' but doesn't detail how this critical challenge will be overcome. Additionally, evaluating the effectiveness of the approach requires access to large FMs and substantial computational resources. The core idea is implementable, but scaling it to actual Foundation Models may require considerable engineering effort and computational optimization. The approach is theoretically sound but practically challenging."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical bottleneck in the deployment and maintenance of Foundation Models: the enormous computational cost of continual updating. If successful, it could substantially reduce the resources needed to keep FMs current, making them more sustainable and accessible to a wider range of organizations. The potential impact extends beyond just efficiency gains - by better preserving previously learned knowledge, it could improve FM reliability and reduce the need for extensive retraining. This work could establish important principles for data-efficient updating of large models that would benefit the entire field of AI as models continue to grow in size and complexity."
