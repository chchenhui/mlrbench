    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on probabilistic inference, uncertainty quantification in AI systems, and applications to structured data (graphs). The methodology thoroughly incorporates Bayesian principles for uncertainty propagation in GNNs as outlined in the research idea. The proposal extensively references and builds upon the literature review, citing all provided papers and addressing the key challenges identified (integration of UQ into GNN architectures, distinguishing aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty, scalability, OOD robustness, and empirical validation across applications). The experimental design covers the same application domains mentioned in the idea (molecular property prediction, traffic forecasting, social network analysis). The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions the uncertainty-aware attention mechanism from the research idea, it could have elaborated slightly more on how this mechanism specifically helps with robust decision-making."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, expected outcomes, and impact. The theoretical framework is presented with precise mathematical formulations, explaining how distributions are propagated through GNN layers. The algorithmic steps are detailed with specific equations for uncertainty propagation, distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, and implementing uncertainty-aware attention. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are comprehensively described. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact implementation details of the non-linearities on distributions could be more precisely defined rather than listing multiple options; (2) The relationship between the variational parameters and the network weights could be more explicitly stated; (3) Some of the mathematical notation (e.g., in the ELBO formulation) could be more thoroughly explained for readers less familiar with variational inference."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in GNNs by integrating uncertainty directly into the message-passing mechanism. The key innovations include: (1) Propagating distributions rather than point estimates through GNN layers; (2) The uncertainty-aware attention mechanism that weights messages based on uncertainty; (3) The explicit separation of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty within the GNN architecture. While these contributions are valuable, the core technical approach builds upon established methods in Bayesian neural networks and variational inference, adapting them to the graph domain. The proposal acknowledges related work like LGNSDE (Bergna et al., 2024) and evidential approaches (Yu et al., 2025), and while it offers improvements and integration of these ideas, it doesn't represent a completely groundbreaking paradigm shift. The moment-matching approach for distribution aggregation is practical but follows standard techniques in probabilistic modeling. The proposal could have pushed further on theoretical innovations beyond the application of known Bayesian methods to GNNs."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with a well-grounded theoretical framework based on variational inference principles. The mathematical formulations for propagating distributions through GNN layers are correctly specified, and the ELBO objective function follows established practices in Bayesian deep learning. The approach to distinguishing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty is theoretically justified, building on the work of Kendall & Gal (2017). The uncertainty-aware attention mechanism is mathematically coherent. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and appropriate for assessing both predictive performance and uncertainty quality. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The approximations used for propagating distributions through non-linearities need more rigorous justification; (2) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address the computational challenges of sampling-based approaches; (3) While the moment-matching approach is practical, its limitations for capturing complex, non-Gaussian posterior distributions could be more thoroughly discussed. Overall, the technical approach is sound, with minor areas that would benefit from deeper theoretical analysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable scope. The implementation leverages existing frameworks (PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric) and builds on established methods in Bayesian deep learning. The datasets selected (QM9, MoleculeNet, METR-LA, citation networks) are publicly available and commonly used in GNN research. The evaluation metrics and experimental design are well-defined and achievable. However, there are several feasibility concerns: (1) The computational cost of propagating distributions through multiple GNN layers could be substantial, especially for large graphs; (2) The moment-matching approximations might not scale well to high-dimensional node features; (3) The Monte Carlo sampling alternative would significantly increase computational requirements; (4) Training variational models with complex posteriors can be challenging and may require careful optimization strategies not fully detailed in the proposal; (5) The comparison against numerous baselines (standard GNNs, MC Dropout, Deep Ensembles, CF-GNN, Evidential GNNs, GEBM, LGNSDE) is ambitious and may require significant implementation effort. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do present practical hurdles that would need to be carefully addressed during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in the reliability and trustworthiness of GNNs by developing a principled framework for uncertainty quantification. This has significant implications for high-stakes applications like drug discovery, traffic management, and financial modeling where understanding prediction confidence is crucial. The work contributes to both theoretical and practical aspects of graph representation learning and probabilistic machine learning. The explicit separation of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty provides valuable interpretability for decision-makers. The proposal aligns well with the growing emphasis on trustworthy AI and robust machine learning. However, the significance is somewhat limited by: (1) The incremental nature of the technical approach, which builds on existing Bayesian methods rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms; (2) The focus on standard GNN architectures rather than addressing more recent developments like transformers for graphs; (3) Limited discussion of how the approach might generalize to other structured data types mentioned in the workshop scope (time series, text, video). Nevertheless, the potential impact on applications requiring reliable uncertainty estimates in graph-based systems is substantial."
