    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on sparsity in deep learning, particularly the intersection of Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs), quantization, and hardware efficiency for inference. The proposal builds upon the literature review by acknowledging existing approaches (MiLo, MC-MoE, MoQa, MoQE) and their limitations, such as static quantization schemes and hardware inefficiencies with extreme quantization. It extends beyond current work by proposing dynamic mixed-precision quantization that adapts to expert importance, addressing a key gap identified in the literature. The methodology section thoroughly explains how the approach bridges MoE sparsity with adaptive quantization, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of fostering connections between traditionally independent research areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from motivation to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical approach is explained in detail, with precise mathematical formulations for expert characterization, bit-width selection, and quantization-aware training. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, evaluation metrics, baselines, and implementation details. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating the RL policy decisions into the inference pipeline could be more explicitly described, (2) the relationship between the expert importance metrics and the RL reward function could be more thoroughly explained, and (3) some technical details about the hardware simulation approach could be elaborated further. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to quantizing MoE models by introducing dynamic mixed-precision quantization that adapts bit-widths based on expert importance. While quantization of MoE models has been explored in prior work (e.g., MiLo, MC-MoE, MoQa, MoQE), this proposal innovates in several ways: (1) it introduces a reinforcement learning policy for dynamic bit-width allocation, which is distinct from the static or pre-determined approaches in existing literature; (2) it incorporates hardware-in-the-loop optimization to ensure practical efficiency gains on real hardware; and (3) it proposes a co-design approach that integrates quantization-aware training with MoE architecture modifications. The combination of these elements represents a significant advancement over existing approaches, which typically apply uniform bit-widths or static mixed-precision schemes. The proposal doesn't completely reinvent the field but offers a fresh perspective that meaningfully extends current research directions."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The mathematical formulations for expert characterization, bit-width selection via RL, and quantization-aware training are well-defined and theoretically sound. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, evaluation metrics, and baselines from the literature. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the RL policy's convergence properties and stability under different expert activation patterns could be more thoroughly analyzed; (2) the straight-through estimator for QAT has known limitations that aren't fully addressed; (3) the hardware simulation approach could benefit from more detailed validation against real-world hardware behavior; and (4) the expected outcomes (2-3x speedup, 40% memory reduction) could be better justified with preliminary results or theoretical analysis. While these limitations don't undermine the overall soundness of the approach, they represent areas where additional rigor would be beneficial."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and implementation details. The methodology leverages established techniques (RL, QAT, hardware simulation) and builds upon existing MoE architectures mentioned in the literature review. The experimental design specifies concrete datasets (C4, Wikipedia, ImageNet) and hardware platforms (NVIDIA A100, Apple M2) for evaluation. However, several challenges may affect feasibility: (1) training an effective RL policy for bit-width selection across diverse MoE architectures may require extensive computational resources and hyperparameter tuning; (2) hardware-in-the-loop optimization introduces additional complexity and potential bottlenecks in the research pipeline; (3) maintaining accuracy within the stated <1% drop threshold while achieving significant compression may be challenging for certain tasks or models; and (4) implementing efficient mixed-precision kernels for various hardware platforms requires substantial engineering effort. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal infeasible, but rather highlight areas requiring careful attention during execution."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in deploying large MoE models on resource-constrained hardware, which has significant implications for democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. By enabling efficient inference of MoE models, the research could facilitate deployment on edge devices and reduce the environmental impact of AI systems, aligning with the growing emphasis on sustainable AI. The approach bridges multiple research areas (MoEs, quantization, hardware optimization) in a novel way, potentially inspiring new directions in efficient AI system design. The expected outcomes (2-3x speedup, 40% memory reduction with <1% accuracy drop) would represent a meaningful advancement over current approaches. The significance extends beyond academic interest to practical applications, potentially enabling deployment of large MoE models in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices, IoT systems, and cost-sensitive cloud platforms. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's goal of exploring how sparsity can serve as a unifying framework across multiple dimensions of AI."
