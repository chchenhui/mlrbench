        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the intersection of MoEs, quantization, hardware optimization, and inference efficiency. The methodology thoroughly explores dynamic mixed-precision quantization for MoE models, which is precisely what was outlined in the research idea. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, building upon works like MiLo, MC-MoE, and MoQa while addressing identified challenges such as quantization-induced accuracy degradation and adaptive bit-width allocation. The comprehensive approach spanning expert importance analysis, mixed-precision quantization, RL-based bit-width selection, and quantization-aware training is consistent with the multidisciplinary nature of the workshop and the specific research direction proposed."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, making the approach understandable and reproducible. Each component of the methodology is thoroughly explained, including expert importance analysis, mixed-precision quantization framework, RL for bit-width selection, and quantization-aware training. The experimental design section provides clear information about models, datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the RL policy and hardware-specific optimizations could be more explicitly defined, (2) some technical details about the integration of the quantization scheme with existing MoE inference pipelines are somewhat vague, and (3) the transition between training and inference phases could be more clearly delineated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to MoE quantization by introducing dynamic mixed-precision quantization based on expert importance. While individual components like expert-specific quantization (MC-MoE) and RL for bit-width selection exist in related contexts, their integration and application to MoE models represents a fresh perspective. The Expert Importance Score that combines activation frequency, contribution magnitude, and quantization sensitivity is an innovative metric for guiding quantization decisions. The reinforcement learning approach for dynamic bit-width selection that incorporates hardware characteristics is also relatively novel. However, the proposal shares conceptual similarities with existing works like MC-MoE's mixed-precision quantization and MoQa's multi-stage awareness. The quantization-aware training with expert specialization builds incrementally on existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. While the overall framework is innovative, several individual components are extensions or combinations of existing approaches rather than groundbreaking new methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The mathematical formulations for expert importance analysis, quantization procedures, and reinforcement learning framework are well-defined and theoretically sound. The Expert Importance Score combines multiple relevant factors that logically influence quantization decisions. The RL formulation for bit-width selection is appropriate for the sequential decision-making nature of the problem. The quantization-aware training methodology incorporates established techniques like simulated quantization and specialized loss functions. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering multiple models, datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the theoretical analysis of how different bit-widths affect the expressivity of experts could be more thorough, (2) the potential interaction effects between quantized experts during inference could be more rigorously analyzed, and (3) the statistical significance of the expected performance improvements could be more formally justified. Overall, the approach is technically sound with minor gaps in theoretical analysis."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined implementation steps. The methodology builds on established techniques in quantization, MoE architectures, and reinforcement learning, making it implementable with current technology and methods. The experimental design outlines realistic models, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The hardware platforms for evaluation are appropriate and diverse. However, several challenges may affect feasibility: (1) the hardware-in-the-loop optimization for RL training could be computationally expensive and time-consuming, (2) the proposed evaluation across multiple hardware platforms (A100, T4, CPUs, mobile chipsets) represents a significant engineering effort, (3) the integration of dynamic bit-width selection into existing inference frameworks may require substantial modifications to current libraries, and (4) the precision-conditioned training approach may face stability issues when gradually reducing precision. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they do increase implementation complexity and resource requirements. The proposal would benefit from more detailed discussion of potential implementation challenges and mitigation strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in deploying large MoE models efficiently, which has significant implications for both research and practical applications. The expected outcomes of 2-3x faster inference and 40% lower memory usage with minimal accuracy degradation would represent a substantial advancement in MoE deployment efficiency. The approach bridges multiple research areas (MoEs, quantization, hardware optimization, reinforcement learning) in line with the workshop's goals. The broader impacts section convincingly argues for the proposal's significance in democratizing LLM access, improving environmental sustainability, advancing edge AI, fostering research community synergies, and enabling new commercial applications. The future research directions identified are promising and demonstrate the potential long-term impact of this work. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of some components and the focus on a specific subset of efficiency optimization (quantization) rather than a more comprehensive rethinking of MoE architectures. Nevertheless, the practical importance of enabling efficient MoE deployment on resource-constrained hardware makes this a highly significant contribution to the field."
