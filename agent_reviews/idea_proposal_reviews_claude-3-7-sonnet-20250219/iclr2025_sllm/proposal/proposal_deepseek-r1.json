    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on the intersection of Mixture of Experts, quantization, and hardware efficiency for inference. The methodology incorporates dynamic mixed-precision quantization for MoE models, which is precisely what was outlined in the research idea. The proposal builds upon the literature review by acknowledging and extending work from papers like MC-MoE, MiLo, and MoQa, addressing the key challenges identified in the literature review such as quantization-induced accuracy degradation and adaptive bit-width allocation. The three-stage approach (expert-specific quantization, RL-based bit-width selection, and hardware co-design) comprehensively addresses the task's emphasis on bridging traditionally independent research areas."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The three-stage methodology is logically organized with well-defined mathematical formulations for each component. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the experimental design includes specific datasets, models, baselines, and metrics. The expected outcomes are quantified (e.g., '2-3× faster inference and 40% lower memory usage'). However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for determining expert importance scores (w_i) could be more detailed, (2) the integration between the RL policy and the quantization process during inference could be further elaborated, and (3) some technical details about how the hardware feedback loop works in practice are somewhat abstract."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a new way. The integration of reinforcement learning for dynamic bit-width selection based on expert activation patterns is innovative, as is the hardware-in-the-loop optimization approach. The co-design of MoE architecture and quantization scheme during training represents a fresh perspective. However, the core ideas build significantly upon existing work in the literature (MC-MoE, MiLo, MoQa), which already explore mixed-precision quantization for MoEs. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches. The RL-based policy for bit-width selection adds novelty, but similar approaches have been explored in other quantization contexts, though perhaps not specifically for MoEs with hardware feedback."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound with well-formulated mathematical expressions and a rigorous methodology. The three-stage approach is logically constructed, with each stage building upon the previous one. The quantization strategy is grounded in established techniques, and the RL formulation for bit-width selection is appropriate for the optimization problem. The hardware co-design approach with differentiable proxies for hardware metrics is theoretically well-founded. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets, models, baselines, and metrics to evaluate the approach. However, there are some potential concerns: (1) the stability of the RL training with hardware-in-the-loop feedback might be challenging in practice, (2) the assumption that expert importance can be reliably determined may not always hold, and (3) the latency model might be oversimplified for complex hardware architectures."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The use of pre-trained MoE architectures (GLaM, OLMoE) and established datasets is practical. The quantization techniques build upon existing methods, and the RL approach for bit-width selection is implementable with current frameworks. However, several aspects may require significant effort: (1) hardware-in-the-loop training with 10,000 episodes across multiple platforms (Gem5, NVIDIA Jetson, TPUv4) is resource-intensive and potentially time-consuming, (2) developing accurate differentiable proxies for hardware metrics is challenging and may require extensive calibration, and (3) ensuring that the dynamic bit-width selection works efficiently during inference without introducing additional latency overhead could be difficult. The expected outcomes (2-3× speedup, 40% memory reduction) seem ambitious but potentially achievable given the comprehensive approach."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in deploying large MoE models on resource-constrained hardware, which is highly relevant to both academic research and industry applications. If successful, the approach could significantly advance the field of efficient LLM inference, making MoE models more accessible for real-world applications. The expected outcomes (2-3× faster inference, 40% lower memory usage with <1% accuracy drop) would represent a substantial improvement over current methods. The work bridges multiple research areas (MoEs, quantization, hardware optimization) as emphasized in the workshop description. The potential impact extends beyond just efficiency gains to include advances in interpretability and adaptability of AI systems. The framework's applicability across diverse hardware platforms (from edge devices to cloud TPUs) further enhances its significance. However, the impact might be somewhat limited by the focus on inference rather than training, and by potential challenges in generalizing across very different MoE architectures."
