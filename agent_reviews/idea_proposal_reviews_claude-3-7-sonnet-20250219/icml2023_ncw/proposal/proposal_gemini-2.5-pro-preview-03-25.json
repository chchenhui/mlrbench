        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on neural compression, information theory, and theoretical understanding of compression methods. The proposal builds upon the core idea of replacing discrete quantization with continuous normalizing flows and incorporating the Information Bottleneck principle, as outlined in the research idea. It extensively references and builds upon the literature review, particularly drawing from papers on normalizing flows (references 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) and information bottleneck principles (references 1, 2, 10). The methodology section clearly outlines how these concepts will be integrated into the FlowCodec framework. The proposal also addresses the workshop's interest in theoretical limits and information-theoretic principles by providing a mathematical framework that connects the KL divergence term to coding rates and RD limits."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The problem statement, proposed solution, research objectives, and methodology are all presented in a logical and coherent manner. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-explained, particularly the objective function and the relationship between the KL divergence and rate. The architecture of FlowCodec is described in detail, including the encoder, decoder, latent space, and prior distribution. The training procedure, experimental design, and evaluation metrics are all thoroughly explained. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact mechanism for practical entropy coding of the continuous latents could be more detailed, (2) The relationship between the theoretical KL-based rate and practical bitrates could be more explicitly formulated, and (3) Some technical details about the specific flow architectures to be used could be more concrete rather than listing multiple options."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to neural compression by combining normalizing flows with the Information Bottleneck principle in a way that eliminates the need for discrete quantization. While both normalizing flows and information bottleneck have been used separately in compression (as noted in references 9 and 10), their integration specifically to address the limitations of quantization represents a fresh perspective. The continuous latent space approach and the explicit incorporation of the IB principle through the KL divergence term offer a theoretically grounded alternative to traditional quantization-based methods. However, the novelty is somewhat tempered by the fact that similar ideas have been explored in adjacent contexts - reference 9 already uses normalizing flows for compression, and reference 10 combines flows with IB for classification. The extension to JSCC is interesting but presented as a secondary contribution rather than the core innovation. The proposal builds incrementally on existing methods rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness. The mathematical formulation of the rate-distortion objective using the KL divergence is theoretically well-grounded in information theory. The connection between the IB principle and compression is rigorously established. The use of normalizing flows to model continuous distributions with tractable likelihoods is technically sound and leverages their key properties (invertibility, tractable Jacobian). The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. However, there are some potential technical challenges that could be addressed more thoroughly: (1) The practical implementation of entropy coding for the continuous latents during deployment, (2) The potential computational complexity of deep flow models, especially for high-dimensional data like images, and (3) The stability of training deep normalizing flows, which is acknowledged but could be addressed with more specific solutions."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan, but with some notable challenges. On the positive side, the authors plan to use established datasets and evaluation metrics, and the core components (normalizing flows, autoencoder architectures) have existing implementations that can be adapted. The experimental design is realistic and the evaluation methodology is standard in the field. However, several feasibility concerns exist: (1) Training deep normalizing flows is known to be computationally intensive and can suffer from instability issues, especially for high-dimensional data like images, (2) The computational complexity of the proposed approach might be high compared to discrete methods, potentially limiting practical applicability, (3) The theoretical analysis connecting the KL divergence to achievable coding rates is ambitious and may be challenging to derive rigorously, and (4) The extension to JSCC adds another layer of complexity that might be difficult to fully explore within a typical research timeframe. While these challenges are acknowledged in the proposal, they represent significant hurdles that could impact the completeness of the results."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in neural compression - the limitations imposed by discrete quantization. If successful, FlowCodec could advance the state-of-the-art in learned compression by providing a fully differentiable alternative with stronger theoretical guarantees. The significance lies in several aspects: (1) Bridging theory and practice by establishing clearer connections between information-theoretic principles and practical compression systems, (2) Potentially improving reconstruction quality, especially for fine details and textures that might be lost during quantization, (3) Offering smoother rate control through the continuous parameter Î², and (4) Enabling new applications through end-to-end differentiability, such as integration with downstream tasks or JSCC. The work directly contributes to the workshop's focus on theoretical understanding and information-theoretic principles in compression. However, the practical impact might be limited by computational efficiency concerns, and the improvements over existing methods might be incremental rather than transformative in some scenarios."
