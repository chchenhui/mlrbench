        "justification": "The Hybrid Residual Neural Operator idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on combining scientific and machine learning models. It directly addresses the workshop's core theme of synergizing scientific simulators with ML approaches to overcome limitations of both paradigms. The proposal specifically targets scientific simulators (climate, fluid dynamics) and enhances them with neural operators, which matches the workshop's interest in applications across scientific domains. The two-stage framework exemplifies the 'grey-box modeling' mentioned in the task description by using ML to correct systematic biases in scientific models while preserving their domain knowledge. The approach also addresses both methodological aspects and practical applications, covering the two main topic areas of the workshop."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation is well-articulated, establishing the complementary strengths and weaknesses of scientific simulators and data-driven models. The two-stage framework is explained in a logical sequence with clear steps: (1) training an FNO on simulator outputs, and (2) learning a residual network to correct systematic errors. The training methodology incorporating physics-informed loss terms and uncertainty quantification is specified. The only minor ambiguities are in the details of how the physics-informed loss terms would be formulated for different domains and how the 'minimal fine-tuning' for new parameter regimes would be implemented. Otherwise, the approach is well-defined and comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its specific implementation and integration approach. While neural operators (particularly FNOs) and residual learning are established techniques, their combination in this two-stage framework for scientific simulator enhancement is relatively fresh. The integration of physics-informed loss terms with uncertainty quantification via dropout ensembles in this specific context adds originality. However, the core concept of using ML to correct scientific model errors has been explored in various forms in the literature. The approach builds intelligently on existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts, placing it in the 'good' rather than 'excellent' category for novelty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposed approach is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Fourier Neural Operators have been successfully implemented for various scientific domains, and residual learning is a well-established technique. The two-stage training process is straightforward and can leverage existing frameworks. The physics-informed loss terms may require domain-specific expertise but are implementable. The computational requirements seem reasonable, especially since the approach aims to reduce computational costs compared to full simulators. The uncertainty quantification via dropout ensembles is also a practical technique. The main implementation challenge would be adapting the framework to different scientific domains, but the general approach appears robust and practical."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in scientific computing: the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. By creating hybrid models that maintain scientific fidelity while dramatically reducing computational costs, the approach could have far-reaching impacts across multiple scientific domains. The potential to 'democratize large-scale scientific modeling' is particularly significant, as it could make sophisticated simulations accessible to researchers with limited computational resources. The ability to adapt to new parameter regimes with minimal fine-tuning also addresses the generalization limitations of pure ML approaches. The framework could advance both scientific modeling and machine learning research by providing a systematic way to combine their strengths, directly addressing the workshop's core focus."
