    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) and its connections to self-supervised learning and representation learning. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including the two-stage framework with self-supervised goal representation learning using contrastive methods and hierarchical attention. The methodology section thoroughly elaborates on the context-aware contrastive loss mentioned in the idea. The proposal also addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as sparse reward environments, sample inefficiency, and the need for rich goal-state representations. The experimental design includes relevant domains (Meta-World and 3D molecular generation) that align with the workshop's interest in applications beyond standard domains. The only minor inconsistency is that some of the cited papers in the literature review aren't explicitly referenced in the proposal, though their concepts are incorporated."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with well-defined algorithmic steps. The mathematical formulations for the contrastive learning approach and context-aware contrastive loss are precisely defined. The two-stage framework is explained thoroughly, making it easy to understand how the self-supervised goal representation learning feeds into the goal-conditioned reinforcement learning stage. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are also clearly specified. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for dynamic goal relabeling during replay could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the hierarchical attention mechanism and the contrastive learning objective could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of the shared embedding network could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a novel way. The integration of self-supervised learning with GCRL is not entirely new, but the specific approach using context-aware contrastive loss to align representations across temporally distant goals is innovative. The use of hierarchical attention to encode goals and intermediate states, capturing their relational structure, also adds a fresh perspective to the field. The proposal builds upon existing work in contrastive learning and GCRL but extends it by focusing on the temporal relationships between goals and states. While the individual components (contrastive learning, hierarchical attention, goal-conditioned RL) are established techniques, their combination and application to the specific problem of learning goal representations in sparse reward environments represent a meaningful contribution. However, the approach shares similarities with some of the papers mentioned in the literature review, particularly those on self-supervised goal representation learning and context-aware contrastive loss, which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical foundations. The contrastive learning approach is mathematically well-formulated, with clear definitions of positive and negative pairs and appropriate loss functions. The integration with goal-conditioned Q-learning is theoretically justified, and the context-aware contrastive loss is properly defined. The methodology builds upon established techniques in reinforcement learning and representation learning, with appropriate citations to relevant literature. The experimental design includes relevant datasets and evaluation metrics that align with the research objectives. The hierarchical attention mechanism is a well-founded approach for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the combined approach are not explicitly addressed, (2) the impact of the choice of similarity function in the contrastive loss could be analyzed more rigorously, and (3) the potential limitations of the approach in non-stationary environments could be discussed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it may require moderate refinement and optimization. The two-stage framework is implementable using current deep learning libraries and reinforcement learning algorithms. The contrastive learning approach and hierarchical attention mechanisms are well-established techniques with available implementations. The datasets mentioned (Meta-World and 3D molecular generation) are accessible and suitable for the proposed experiments. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional resources or development: (1) training the hierarchical attention model on diverse experience sequences may require substantial computational resources, (2) the integration of the self-supervised module with the GCRL algorithm may require careful tuning to ensure stable learning, and (3) the context-aware contrastive loss may need refinement to work effectively across different domains. Additionally, the proposal does not provide a detailed timeline or resource estimation, which would be helpful for assessing the full feasibility of the project."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses important challenges in GCRL and has the potential for significant impact in the field. By improving sample efficiency and compositional generalization in sparse reward environments, the proposed approach could make GCRL more practical for real-world applications. The focus on interpretable latent spaces and causal goal reasoning aligns with the growing interest in explainable AI and could facilitate the deployment of RL systems in critical domains. The application to molecular generation and robotics demonstrates the broad relevance of the approach. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's interest in connecting GCRL with representation learning and self-supervised learning, potentially contributing to the theoretical understanding of these connections. The expected outcomes include not only algorithmic improvements but also practical benefits for real-world deployment, enhancing the significance of the research. However, while the impact is likely to be substantial within the GCRL community, it may not be transformative for the broader field of AI, which slightly limits its overall significance."
