    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) and its connections to representation learning and self-supervised learning. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including the two-stage framework with self-supervised goal representation learning using contrastive methods and hierarchical attention mechanisms. It thoroughly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, such as sparse reward environments, sample inefficiency, and the need for rich goal-state representations. The methodology section provides detailed technical formulations that are consistent with the proposed approach in the idea. The application domains (Meta-World for robotics and molecular generation) align with the workshop's interest in broader applications of GCRL beyond traditional domains."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the context and motivation for the research. The methodology section provides detailed technical descriptions of the approach, including mathematical formulations of the hierarchical attention encoder, context-aware contrastive loss, and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning components. The experimental design is well-specified with clear evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact implementation details of the 'enhanced hindsight experience replay' could be more precisely defined, (2) the mutual information approximation for goal relabeling could be more explicitly formulated, and (3) some of the mathematical notation could be more consistently applied throughout the document. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents several innovative contributions to the field. The context-aware contrastive loss that explicitly accounts for temporal progress toward goals is a novel extension of standard contrastive learning approaches. The hierarchical attention architecture for capturing both local and global dependencies between states and goals represents a fresh perspective on representation learning for GCRL. The integration of these components into a cohesive framework that bridges self-supervised learning and GCRL is original and well-differentiated from prior work. The enhanced hindsight experience replay that leverages learned representations to select informative goals for relabeling is also innovative. While individual components build upon existing techniques (contrastive learning, attention mechanisms, SAC, HER), their combination and adaptation to the GCRL setting constitute a novel approach. The proposal clearly distinguishes its contributions from prior work referenced in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The contrastive learning approach is well-grounded in established self-supervised learning principles, and the goal-conditioned SAC extension follows from standard reinforcement learning theory. The hierarchical attention mechanism is appropriately formulated for capturing dependencies in sequential decision-making. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from stronger theoretical justification: (1) the theoretical guarantees on sample complexity mentioned in the expected outcomes are not fully developed in the methodology, (2) the approximation of mutual information for goal relabeling lacks rigorous formulation, and (3) the weighting function in the context-aware contrastive loss could benefit from more theoretical motivation. The experimental design is comprehensive and includes appropriate ablation studies to validate individual components, which strengthens the overall soundness of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined components and evaluation metrics. The use of established benchmarks (Meta-World and MolGym) provides a practical foundation for empirical evaluation. The hierarchical attention and contrastive learning components build on existing techniques that have been successfully implemented in related domains. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) training hierarchical policies with subgoal generation can be unstable and may require careful hyperparameter tuning, (2) the computational requirements for the attention-based architecture across long trajectories could be substantial, especially in the molecular generation domain, and (3) the context-aware contrastive loss with distance-based weighting may require significant engineering to implement efficiently. The proposal would benefit from more discussion of potential implementation challenges and mitigation strategies. Nevertheless, the overall approach appears implementable with current technology and methods, though it may require considerable computational resources and engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses important challenges in GCRL that have significant implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications. The integration of self-supervised representation learning with GCRL has the potential to substantially improve sample efficiency and generalization capabilities, addressing key limitations of current approaches. The application to both continuous control (robotics) and discrete action (molecular design) domains demonstrates the broad applicability of the approach. The expected outcomes include methodological advances, theoretical insights, and practical applications that could influence multiple research communities. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's focus on connections between GCRL and representation learning, limitations of existing methods, and applications to broader domains. The potential impact on democratizing RL by reducing computational requirements and enabling more intuitive human-AI collaboration further enhances its significance. The proposal could have transformative effects on how GCRL is approached and applied in various domains."
