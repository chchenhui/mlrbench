    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Clin-ACT proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on time series representation learning for healthcare, specifically targeting pediatric ICU data - an explicitly mentioned minority group. The proposal comprehensively tackles the key challenges outlined in the task: limited labeling through active learning, handling unlabeled data via contrastive learning, addressing high dimensionality through embedding techniques, and managing missing values/outliers through specialized augmentation strategies. The methodology builds upon the literature review, extending approaches from SLAC-Time, MM-NCL, and STraTS while addressing their limitations. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions robustness to missingness, it could have more explicitly addressed fairness considerations mentioned in the workshop topics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is presented with appropriate mathematical formulations that are well-defined and contextualized. The three core modules (Imputation-Aware Contrastive Encoder, Active Learning Query Strategy, and Prototype-Based Interpretability Layer) are logically organized with clear connections between them. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact procedure for integrating clinician feedback into the active learning loop could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the prototype learning and the contrastive objective could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some hyperparameters (like the number of prototypes P=10) could benefit from more justification."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The integration of imputation-aware contrastive learning with active learning and prototype-based interpretability represents a novel combination not previously explored in pediatric ICU settings. The specialized augmentation strategies tailored to clinical time series (particularly the mask perturbation technique) are innovative. The hybrid uncertainty-diversity criterion for active learning is a fresh approach to the label efficiency problem in clinical settings. The prototype-based interpretability layer that maps embeddings to clinical archetypes is also original. While individual components build upon existing techniques (contrastive learning, active learning, prototype networks), their integration and adaptation to pediatric ICU data with explicit handling of missingness patterns represents a meaningful advancement beyond the cited literature. The proposal is not completely revolutionary, as it builds upon established methodological frameworks, but it offers substantial innovations in their combination and application."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness with well-formulated mathematical foundations. The contrastive learning approach with InfoNCE loss is theoretically grounded, and the mask regularization term provides a principled way to handle missingness. The active learning strategy combines uncertainty and diversity in a normalized fashion, which is mathematically sound. The prototype learning objective with coverage and separation terms is well-formulated. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical justification for why the specific augmentation strategies would preserve clinical validity is somewhat limited, (2) the choice of Î»=0.6 for balancing uncertainty and diversity is stated as a hypothesis without strong theoretical backing, (3) the faithfulness metric for interpretability evaluation could benefit from more formal definition, and (4) the proposal lacks detailed discussion of potential failure modes or theoretical limitations of the approach. Overall, while the technical foundations are solid, some aspects would benefit from deeper theoretical justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The datasets (internal PICU dataset and public pediatric sepsis dataset) are appropriate and of sufficient scale. The computational requirements (NVIDIA A100 GPUs, PyTorch) are reasonable for the proposed methods. The experimental design with clear baselines and evaluation metrics is well-conceived. However, several practical challenges affect the feasibility: (1) recruiting and maintaining engagement of pediatric intensivists for the active learning loop and satisfaction survey may be challenging, (2) the total annotation budget of 1,000 windows may be optimistic given clinical time constraints, (3) the integration of the three modules (contrastive encoder, active learning, and prototype layer) introduces implementation complexity that may require significant engineering effort, and (4) the proposal doesn't fully address how to handle potential distribution shifts between the internal and external validation datasets. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do introduce moderate implementation risks that would need careful management."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical need in pediatric critical care, a high-risk minority population explicitly mentioned in the workshop call. The potential impact is substantial across multiple dimensions: (1) clinical impact through improved sepsis detection and mortality prediction in a vulnerable population, (2) methodological impact by advancing label-efficient representation learning for irregular clinical time series, (3) practical impact by reducing clinician annotation burden by a targeted 60%, and (4) adoption impact through enhanced interpretability and trust. The expected outcomes are ambitious but well-justified, with clear metrics for success (+12% AUROC improvement, 60% label reduction, high faithfulness scores). The proposal explicitly connects technical innovations to clinical workflow integration and trust-building, which enhances its potential for real-world adoption. The focus on pediatric ICU data addresses an underserved domain in machine learning research, making the potential contributions particularly valuable. The proposal convincingly argues that success could lead to broader applications in other minority clinical cohorts."
