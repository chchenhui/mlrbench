        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on time series representation learning for healthcare, particularly targeting pediatric ICU data (an explicitly mentioned minority group). The proposal incorporates all key elements from the original idea, including the three-component Clin-ACT framework combining contrastive learning, active learning, and prototype-based interpretability. It thoroughly addresses the challenges highlighted in the literature review, such as handling missing values (through imputation-aware augmentations), limited labeled data (via active learning), interpretability concerns (using prototype-based explanations), high dimensionality (with the transformer encoder), and class imbalance (through uncertainty-diversity sampling). The methodology builds upon and extends the approaches discussed in the cited papers, particularly SLAC-Time, MM-NCL, STraTS, and APC, while addressing their limitations."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The three main components of Clin-ACT are consistently referenced throughout the document, making it easy to follow the conceptual framework. The technical details are presented with appropriate mathematical formulations, including the contrastive loss function, prototype similarity calculations, and active learning criteria. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are explicitly stated. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for integrating clinician feedback into the model refinement process could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the prototype layer and the active learning component could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., MMD-diversity) are introduced without full explanation. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating three typically separate approaches—contrastive self-supervised learning, active learning, and prototype-based interpretability—into a cohesive framework specifically designed for pediatric ICU data. This integration represents a fresh perspective not fully explored in the cited literature. The imputation-aware augmentations tailored to clinical time series and the uncertainty-diversity criterion for active learning selection show innovation beyond existing approaches. However, each individual component builds heavily on established methods: the contrastive learning framework resembles approaches in papers [1] and [2], the active learning component draws from standard uncertainty sampling techniques [5], and the prototype-based explanations follow similar concepts to those in interpretable AI literature [6]. While the combination is novel and the application to pediatric ICU data is valuable, the technical innovations within each component are incremental rather than revolutionary. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines the approaches in the literature review."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices. The transformer-based encoder with temporal position encoding is appropriate for handling irregular time series, and the mathematical formulations for contrastive learning and prototype similarity are technically correct. The approach to handling missing values through augmentations rather than imputation is well-founded and supported by recent literature. The active learning criterion balancing uncertainty and diversity is theoretically sound for addressing class imbalance. The evaluation plan includes appropriate metrics for downstream performance, annotation efficiency, and interpretability. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the statistical properties of the imputation-aware augmentations could be more thoroughly analyzed, (2) the convergence properties of the prototype learning process are not discussed, and (3) potential failure modes or limitations of the approach are not fully addressed. Despite these gaps, the overall technical foundation is robust and well-grounded in established methods."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic components. The use of the eICU collaborative research database provides a practical data source for implementation. The three main components—encoder training, active learning, and prototype-based interpretability—are all implementable with current deep learning frameworks and techniques. The evaluation metrics are measurable and the experimental design is reasonable. However, several practical challenges may affect implementation: (1) integrating clinicians into the active learning loop requires significant coordination and may face logistical hurdles in real-world settings, (2) the computational requirements for training the transformer-based model on large-scale ICU data could be substantial, (3) the prototype refinement process may require multiple iterations to achieve clinically meaningful representations, and (4) the proposed 60% reduction in labeling effort is an ambitious target that may be difficult to achieve while maintaining performance. While these challenges are significant, they do not render the proposal infeasible, but rather suggest that some timeline or performance expectations may need adjustment during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in healthcare AI—developing robust, interpretable, and label-efficient representations for pediatric ICU time series data. This work has significant potential impact in several ways: (1) reducing the annotation burden on clinicians could enable wider adoption of ML in pediatric critical care, (2) improving sepsis detection in pediatric patients directly addresses a life-threatening condition where early intervention is crucial, (3) the interpretability mechanisms could increase clinician trust and adoption of AI systems in critical care settings, and (4) the methodology could be extended to other minority healthcare domains with similar data challenges. The expected 12% improvement in sepsis detection accuracy, if achieved, would represent a meaningful clinical advancement. The proposal also contributes methodologically to the broader field of time series representation learning by demonstrating how to effectively combine self-supervision, active learning, and interpretability. While the immediate application is focused on pediatric ICU data, the approach has clear potential for broader impact across healthcare domains facing similar challenges with irregular, high-dimensional time series and limited annotations."
