    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FITML workshop's focus on efficient fine-tuning methods and theoretical understanding of fine-tuning processes. The Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT) approach thoroughly explores new methodology for fine-tuning as mentioned in the workshop topics, with particular emphasis on resource efficiency and theoretical foundations. The proposal builds upon the literature review, specifically referencing concepts from papers like 'Adaptive Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Residual Error Analysis' and 'Error Map-Based Fine-Tuning for Efficient Model Adaptation'. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes all consistently address the core idea of dynamically allocating computational resources during fine-tuning based on error patterns, which was outlined in the initial research idea."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the methodology is presented in a logical, step-by-step manner with appropriate mathematical formulations. The error tracking mechanism, dynamic sparsification strategy, adaptive optimization algorithm, and theoretical convergence analysis are all explained in detail with precise mathematical notation. The experimental design section comprehensively outlines datasets, tasks, model architectures, evaluation metrics, and comparative analyses. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the error map calculation and computational overhead could be more explicitly quantified, (2) some of the mathematical formulations, particularly in the theoretical convergence analysis, might be challenging for readers without a strong background in optimization theory, and (3) the transition between theoretical guarantees and practical implementation could be more thoroughly explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a dynamic approach to fine-tuning that adapts based on error patterns. While the concept of error-focused fine-tuning appears in the literature review (e.g., FAIT, Adaptive Fine-Tuning via Residual Error Analysis), RGFT offers several novel contributions: (1) the component-wise residual error tracking mechanism that creates detailed error maps, (2) the dynamic sparsification strategy with progressive scheduling, (3) the integration with standard optimization algorithms, and (4) the theoretical convergence guarantees specific to this approach. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods by focusing on error contributions rather than predetermined sparsification patterns. However, it builds upon rather than completely revolutionizes existing concepts in adaptive fine-tuning, and some elements (like error mapping) have precedents in the cited literature, which is why it doesn't receive the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-developed theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for error tracking, dynamic sparsification, and adaptive optimization are rigorous and build upon established optimization techniques. The theoretical convergence analysis provides formal guarantees under standard assumptions (L-smoothness, bounded variance), which strengthens the proposal's rigor. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering various datasets, model architectures, and evaluation metrics, with appropriate baselines and ablation studies. The implementation details are practical and feasible. However, there are a few areas that could be strengthened: (1) the approximation of error contributions using gradient-based attribution might introduce biases that aren't fully addressed, (2) the proof sketch for convergence guarantees could be more detailed, particularly regarding how the dynamic learning rates affect the convergence rate, and (3) the potential interaction effects between component-wise learning rates and optimization dynamics could be more thoroughly analyzed."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with clear implementation details. The core components—error tracking module, dynamic learning rate scheduler, visualization tools, and benchmarking suite—are all implementable with current deep learning frameworks. The experimental design is realistic and covers a wide range of tasks and model architectures. The authors acknowledge potential challenges, including computational overhead and hyperparameter sensitivity, which demonstrates awareness of implementation difficulties. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the computational overhead of tracking component-wise errors in very large models (hundreds of billions of parameters) might be more significant than the estimated 5%, (2) the approximation method for error contributions might not scale well to all model architectures, (3) the proposed experiments across multiple domains and architectures are ambitious and would require substantial computational resources, and (4) the implementation of the error tracking mechanism without significantly slowing down training might be challenging in practice."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in the field of fine-tuning large models, with potential for significant impact. The expected 50-70% reduction in computational requirements would make advanced AI more accessible to researchers with limited resources, aligning with the workshop's goal of enabling deployment within constrained computational environments. The broader impacts are well-articulated, including resource-efficient AI, environmental sustainability (with estimated 60% reduction in carbon emissions), edge AI applications, accelerated research, and improved model interpretability. The theoretical contributions to understanding error propagation and convergence in adaptive fine-tuning are valuable to the research community. The proposal also opens several promising future research directions. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that the approach is primarily an efficiency improvement rather than a fundamental paradigm shift, and its benefits might vary across different tasks and model architectures."
