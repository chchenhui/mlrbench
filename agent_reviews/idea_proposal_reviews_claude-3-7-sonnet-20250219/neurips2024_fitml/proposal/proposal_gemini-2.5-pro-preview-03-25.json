        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FITML workshop's focus on efficient fine-tuning methods and theoretical understanding of fine-tuning processes. The proposed Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT) framework perfectly matches the initial idea of adaptively allocating computational resources based on error patterns. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works on error analysis (Doe et al., Fan et al.), dynamic sparsification (White et al.), error mapping (Black et al.), theoretical convergence guarantees (Grey et al.), and resource efficiency (Cyan et al.). The methodology section clearly builds upon these foundations while addressing the identified challenges from the literature review, such as identifying error-prone components, dynamic resource allocation, and maintaining model stability."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction provides a comprehensive background and problem statement, followed by a detailed explanation of the proposed solution and research objectives. The methodology section is particularly strong, with clear mathematical formulations of the residual tracking mechanism, error attribution process, and dynamic update strategy. The experimental design is thoroughly outlined with specific tasks, datasets, models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact definition of 'components' could be more precisely specified early on, (2) the relationship between the error scores and the adaptive learning rate could be more explicitly formulated for different scaling functions, and (3) some of the theoretical analysis claims could be more concretely connected to specific mathematical frameworks. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and logically organized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to fine-tuning by introducing a systematic framework for error-guided adaptation. While individual elements like error analysis (Doe et al., 2024), dynamic sparsification (White et al., 2024), and error mapping (Black et al., 2025) exist in the literature, RGFT innovatively combines these concepts into a cohesive framework with several original contributions: (1) the specific mechanism for tracking residuals and attributing errors to model components, (2) the dynamic update strategy with multiple scaling function options, and (3) the theoretical analysis connecting error attribution to convergence properties. The proposal extends beyond existing work by providing a more fine-grained, adaptive approach to parameter updates during fine-tuning. However, it builds significantly on existing concepts rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, which is why it scores a 7 rather than higher. The integration of these concepts into a unified framework with mathematical formalization represents a meaningful advancement rather than a revolutionary breakthrough."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulation of the error attribution mechanism and adaptive update strategy is well-defined, with clear equations for computing error scores, maintaining exponential moving averages, and adjusting learning rates. The proposed methodology is grounded in established optimization techniques and extends them in a principled manner. The theoretical analysis section outlines a reasonable approach to analyzing convergence and stability, building on existing work by Fu et al. (2023) and Grey et al. (2023). The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) the theoretical guarantees for convergence with component-wise adaptive learning rates could be more explicitly formulated, (2) the potential impact of the EMA hyperparameter Î² on stability could be more thoroughly analyzed, and (3) the computational overhead of tracking component-wise errors could be more precisely quantified. Despite these areas for improvement, the overall technical approach is sound and well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The implementation of RGFT can leverage existing deep learning frameworks and fine-tuning libraries, with the main additional components being the error tracking mechanism and adaptive update strategy. The experimental design is practical, using standard benchmarks and models that are widely available. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect the feasibility score: (1) the computational overhead of tracking component-wise gradients and maintaining error scores could be significant, especially for very large models; (2) implementing the adaptive learning rate scheme efficiently within standard optimizers might require non-trivial modifications; (3) the proposed experiments with large language models like Llama-2 7B would require substantial computational resources; and (4) the theoretical analysis of convergence for component-wise adaptive learning rates could be mathematically complex. While these challenges are acknowledged in the proposal and appear manageable, they do represent meaningful hurdles to full implementation, particularly at scale with the largest models mentioned."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in modern machine learning: making fine-tuning of large models more efficient and accessible. If successful, RGFT could significantly reduce the computational resources required for fine-tuning while maintaining performance, which would have broad impact across academic and industrial applications. The potential 50-70% reduction in computational requirements mentioned in the expected outcomes would be a substantial advancement in efficiency. Beyond the practical benefits, the research would contribute valuable insights into fine-tuning dynamics through the analysis of error maps, potentially advancing our theoretical understanding of transfer learning and model adaptation. The proposal directly aligns with the FITML workshop's goals of exploring new methodologies for efficient fine-tuning and advancing theoretical understanding. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on a specific aspect of fine-tuning (adaptive resource allocation) rather than a comprehensive solution to all fine-tuning challenges, and by the incremental nature of the advancement relative to existing PEFT methods. Nevertheless, the potential impact on both practical applications and theoretical understanding is substantial."
