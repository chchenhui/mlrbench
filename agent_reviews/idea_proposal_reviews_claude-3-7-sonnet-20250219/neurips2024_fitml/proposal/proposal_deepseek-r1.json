    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FITML workshop's focus on efficient fine-tuning methods and theoretical understanding. The proposed Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT) method matches the core concept outlined in the research idea, implementing the residual tracking mechanism, dynamic sparsification strategy, and theoretical framework as specified. The proposal also effectively incorporates and builds upon the literature, citing relevant works like 'Dynamic Sparsification in Fine-Tuning' and 'Error Map-Based Fine-Tuning' while addressing key challenges identified in the literature review, such as identifying error-prone components and providing theoretical guarantees. The only minor inconsistency is that some referenced papers appear to be fictional future publications (e.g., arXiv:2407.98765 from '2024'), but the concepts they represent are integrated coherently."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is presented with precise mathematical formulations. The Error Contribution Score, normalization process, and dynamic learning rate adjustments are all well-defined. The experimental design clearly outlines baselines, tasks, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the residual tracking mechanism and the error contribution score could be more explicitly connected, (2) some technical details about how the error map is implemented across different model architectures (e.g., transformers vs. CNNs) are not fully elaborated, and (3) the proof sketch for the theoretical framework is quite brief and could be expanded for better understanding."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a comprehensive framework that combines error analysis with dynamic resource allocation during fine-tuning. While individual components like error mapping and dynamic sparsification have been explored in prior work (as cited in the literature review), RGFT's innovation lies in its unified approach that integrates these concepts with theoretical guarantees. The mathematical formulation for the Error Contribution Score and the adaptive learning rate strategy represent fresh perspectives on fine-tuning optimization. However, the proposal shares conceptual similarities with works like 'Adaptive Fine-Tuning via Residual Error Analysis' and 'Error Map-Based Fine-Tuning' mentioned in the literature review, suggesting it's an evolution of existing approaches rather than a completely groundbreaking concept. The theoretical framework, while valuable, builds upon established convergence analysis techniques for stochastic gradient descent."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for error tracking, normalization, and dynamic learning rate adjustments are well-defined and appear correct. The theoretical framework provides convergence guarantees under reasonable assumptions (smoothness and bounded gradients), which is crucial for establishing the method's reliability. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering multiple domains (NLP, vision, code generation) with appropriate baselines and metrics. The ablation studies are well-conceived to analyze the sensitivity of key hyperparameters. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) the proof sketch is quite brief and would benefit from more detailed derivation, (2) the theoretical analysis doesn't explicitly address how sparsification might affect the convergence properties, and (3) while preliminary results on CIFAR-100 are mentioned, no details are provided about these experiments, making it difficult to assess their validity."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach that can be implemented with current technology and methods. The core components—residual tracking, error mapping, and dynamic learning rate adjustment—are all implementable using standard deep learning frameworks. The experimental design uses established benchmarks and metrics, making evaluation straightforward. However, there are several implementation challenges that affect feasibility: (1) computing layer-wise gradients for error contribution scores adds computational overhead that might partially offset the efficiency gains, especially for very large models; (2) the dynamic sparsification strategy requires careful tuning of the threshold parameter τ, which could be model and task-dependent; (3) the proposal doesn't fully address how to efficiently implement the error tracking mechanism in distributed training settings; and (4) while the method aims to reduce computational costs by 70%, achieving this while maintaining 95% of task performance across diverse domains may be optimistic without more preliminary evidence. These challenges don't make the proposal infeasible, but they do represent significant engineering hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in modern machine learning: making fine-tuning of large models more efficient without sacrificing performance. This has significant implications for both research and practical applications. The potential impact spans multiple domains: (1) enabling deployment of large models on resource-constrained devices, which could democratize access to advanced AI; (2) reducing the environmental impact of model training through lower energy consumption; (3) advancing theoretical understanding of how errors propagate through deep networks; and (4) providing a framework that can be integrated with existing PEFT methods for further efficiency gains. The work bridges theoretical foundations with practical implementations, which aligns perfectly with the FITML workshop's goals. The significance is somewhat limited by the incremental nature of the innovation relative to existing approaches, but the comprehensive integration of theory and practice in a unified framework represents a valuable contribution to the field."
