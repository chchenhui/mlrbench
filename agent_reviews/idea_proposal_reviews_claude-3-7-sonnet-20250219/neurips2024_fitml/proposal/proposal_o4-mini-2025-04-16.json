    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FITML workshop's call for resource-efficient fine-tuning methods with theoretical foundations. The proposal builds upon the literature review's identified works on error analysis (FAIT, Error Map-Based Fine-Tuning) and dynamic sparsification while addressing the key challenges outlined. The methodology section thoroughly explains how RGFT tracks residuals, adaptively allocates resources, and provides theoretical guarantees - all consistent with the research idea of concentrating computational resources on high-error regions. The experimental design covers diverse models and datasets, with appropriate baselines from the literature review. The only minor inconsistency is that some cited papers in the proposal (e.g., Fan et al., 2025; Black et al., 2025) appear to be future publications, which is unusual."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from motivation to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are clearly defined with specific, measurable goals (50-70% reduction in FLOPs, matching baseline performance). The methodology section provides detailed explanations of the three core modules with mathematical formulations and pseudocode that make the approach immediately understandable. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, models, baselines, metrics, and implementation details. The only areas that could benefit from slight refinement are: (1) some mathematical notation could be more explicitly defined (e.g., the exact definition of 'ErrorContribution' in the pseudocode), and (2) the relationship between the theoretical framework and the practical implementation could be more explicitly connected."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a comprehensive framework that combines residual tracking, adaptive update scheduling, and theoretical guarantees. While individual components like error analysis and dynamic sparsification appear in the literature (e.g., FAIT, Dynamic Sparsification paper), RGFT's innovation lies in its integrated approach that continuously tracks per-component residuals to guide both learning rate adaptation and parameter masking. The exponential moving average of residuals and the normalized adaptive learning rate formulation appear to be novel contributions. However, the approach shares conceptual similarities with existing error map-based methods mentioned in the literature review, and the theoretical framework builds upon established adaptive SGD analysis rather than introducing fundamentally new theoretical insights."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound with well-justified methodological choices. The mathematical formulations for residual tracking, masking, and adaptive learning rates are clearly presented and theoretically grounded. The convergence theorem is properly stated with appropriate assumptions, and the proof sketch outlines a valid approach based on adaptive SGD analysis. The experimental design demonstrates rigor with multiple random seeds, statistical significance testing, and comprehensive ablation studies to validate design choices. The metrics chosen appropriately measure both performance and efficiency. The only minor weakness is that while the proposal mentions a transfer learning bound, it doesn't fully elaborate on this theoretical contribution, which would strengthen the soundness of the approach in the context of fine-tuning pre-trained models."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods. The implementation relies on standard frameworks (PyTorch, HuggingFace) and hardware (NVIDIA GPUs) that are widely available. The residual tracking and adaptive update mechanisms can be implemented with reasonable engineering effort. The experimental design is comprehensive but manageable, covering a diverse but not excessive range of models and datasets. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require additional effort: (1) efficiently computing per-component error contributions in large models without significant overhead, (2) ensuring the dynamic masking doesn't introduce training instabilities, and (3) scaling the approach to truly large models like LLaMA-7B may require optimization beyond what's described. The proposal acknowledges these challenges through ablation studies but might underestimate the engineering complexity of implementing efficient residual tracking at scale."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in modern ML: making fine-tuning of large models more efficient and accessible. If successful, RGFT could have significant impact by: (1) enabling deployment of large models on resource-constrained devices, which is increasingly important as models grow larger, (2) providing theoretical insights into fine-tuning dynamics that could guide future parameter-efficient methods, and (3) reducing the environmental and economic costs of model adaptation. The expected 50-70% reduction in computational resources represents a substantial improvement over current methods. The proposal also contributes to the theoretical understanding of adaptive fine-tuning with convergence guarantees. While the impact is significant, it may not be transformative as it builds upon and extends existing paradigms rather than introducing a fundamentally new approach to fine-tuning."

    "OverallAssessment": {

It addresses a significant challenge in modern ML - efficient fine-tuning of large models - with a well-designed approach that has both theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. The proposal is comprehensive, covering methodology, theory, and experimental validation. While not completely revolutionary, it makes meaningful contributions to the field and has clear potential for real-world impact.",
