    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the FITML workshop's focus on efficient fine-tuning methods, theoretical foundations, and practical scalability. The proposal incorporates the core concept from the research idea of Residual-Guided Fine-Tuning (RGFT) that dynamically allocates resources based on error patterns. It thoroughly addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, including error-prone component identification, dynamic resource allocation, and model stability. The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations that build upon the theoretical frameworks mentioned in the literature (e.g., Laura et al., 2023). The only minor inconsistency is that some referenced papers in the proposal (e.g., Zhang et al., 2023) aren't explicitly mentioned in the literature review, though their concepts align with the overall research direction."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with distinct sections that flow logically from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is explained in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The experimental design section clearly outlines datasets, models, baselines, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the residual tracking mechanism and the dynamic sparsification strategy could be more explicitly connected; (2) Some mathematical notations (e.g., the definition of 'a' in Î¸_{l,a}) are introduced without clear explanation; (3) The proposal could more clearly distinguish how RGFT differs from existing approaches like FAIT mentioned in the literature review. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is well-articulated and understandable."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a comprehensive framework that combines residual error tracking with dynamic sparsification for fine-tuning. While individual components like error analysis and adaptive learning rates exist in prior work (as seen in the literature review with papers like 'Adaptive Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Residual Error Analysis' and 'Dynamic Sparsification in Fine-Tuning Large Neural Networks'), RGFT's innovation lies in its integrated approach that connects error identification directly to resource allocation with theoretical guarantees. The proposal extends beyond existing methods by decomposing residuals at both layer and attention-head levels and using this information to modulate learning rates dynamically. However, it shares conceptual similarities with FAIT and other adaptive methods mentioned in the literature review, which somewhat limits its groundbreaking nature. The theoretical framework for convergence analysis also builds upon existing work rather than introducing entirely new mathematical foundations."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and sound methodology. The mathematical formulations for residual tracking, dynamic sparsification, and theoretical analysis are well-developed and build upon established principles in optimization theory. The use of Lyapunov stability theory for convergence analysis is appropriate and well-justified. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering diverse models and datasets with appropriate baselines and metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and addresses them through careful design choices (e.g., using EMA for residual aggregation to handle noise). However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The assumptions of Lipschitz smoothness and bounded gradient variance could be more thoroughly justified for the specific context of fine-tuning large models; (2) The proposal could provide more details on how the error map construction handles potential noise in the residual estimates; (3) The relationship between the theoretical guarantees and the practical implementation could be more explicitly connected. Despite these minor limitations, the overall technical approach is sound and well-founded."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with clearly defined implementation details. The residual tracking mechanism and dynamic sparsification strategy are implementable with current deep learning frameworks, and the experimental design uses established models and datasets. The computational overhead of tracking residuals is mitigated by performing this analysis only every 100 steps. However, there are several practical challenges that may affect implementation: (1) Computing layer-wise and attention-head residuals for very large models like LLaMA-65B could introduce significant computational overhead; (2) The proposal doesn't fully address how to efficiently implement the backpropagation-based sensitivity analysis for residual decomposition at scale; (3) The dynamic adjustment of sparsity thresholds to target 50% sparsity may require careful tuning to avoid instability. While these challenges don't render the approach infeasible, they do introduce implementation complexities that would require careful engineering. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges but could provide more detailed strategies for addressing them, particularly for the largest model scales mentioned."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant challenge in modern machine learning: the inefficiency of uniform fine-tuning approaches for large models. The potential impact is substantial across several dimensions: (1) Computational efficiency - the targeted 70% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining 95% accuracy would represent a major advancement for resource-constrained environments; (2) Theoretical contributions - the formal analysis of convergence under adaptive sparsification extends our understanding of fine-tuning dynamics; (3) Practical applications - enabling efficient deployment of large models on edge devices with limited RAM has wide-ranging implications for accessibility and democratization of AI. The proposal also contributes to the 'Green AI' movement by potentially reducing energy consumption. The error maps generated as a byproduct provide interpretability benefits that could inform future model design. While the approach builds upon existing work rather than introducing a paradigm shift, its comprehensive integration of theory and practice positions it to make a meaningful contribution to the field. The significance is particularly high given the growing importance of efficient fine-tuning methods as models continue to increase in size."
