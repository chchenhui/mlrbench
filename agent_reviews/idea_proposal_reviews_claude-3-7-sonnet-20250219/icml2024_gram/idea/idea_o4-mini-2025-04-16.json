    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on geometry-grounded representation learning and generative modeling. It directly addresses the workshop's emphasis on preserving geometric structure in data by developing diffusion models on Lie groups (SO(3), SE(3)). The proposal fits perfectly within multiple solicited topics: structure-preserving learning through equivariant operators, dynamical systems on manifolds (using Brownian motion and Riemannian Langevin dynamics), and generative modeling of geometric objects. The idea specifically addresses the workshop's motivation that 'maintaining the manifold structure is essential in order to obtain meaningful samples.' The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other workshop topics like self-supervised learning or theoretical frameworks, but this is not a requirement."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity and structure. It clearly articulates the motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The three-step approach (forward process, score estimation, sampling) provides a well-defined methodology. The technical concepts are precisely stated, using appropriate mathematical terminology (Brownian motion, exponential map, Riemannian metric, Langevin dynamics). However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration - for instance, the specific architecture of the equivariant neural network for score estimation, or how exactly the Riemannian Langevin dynamics would be implemented. While these details might be beyond the scope of a brief proposal, their absence slightly reduces the clarity for readers unfamiliar with these advanced concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by combining two powerful frameworks: score-based diffusion models and equivariant neural networks, specifically applied to Lie groups. While both diffusion models and equivariant networks exist separately, their integration for generative modeling on non-Euclidean manifolds with intrinsic symmetries represents a novel approach. The proposal to simulate Brownian motion directly on the group via its exponential map and to perform denoising via Riemannian Langevin dynamics shows innovative thinking. The research doesn't claim to invent entirely new mathematical tools, but rather cleverly adapts and combines existing concepts in a way that hasn't been thoroughly explored. The approach of enforcing equivariance through group convolutional layers while operating in the context of diffusion models on manifolds represents a fresh perspective."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate technical challenges. The mathematical foundations for the proposed approach exist: Lie group theory, diffusion processes on manifolds, and equivariant neural networks are all established areas. Recent advances in score-based generative models provide a solid starting point. However, implementing Brownian motion and Langevin dynamics on Lie groups requires sophisticated mathematical understanding and careful numerical implementation to ensure stability and accuracy. Training equivariant networks for score estimation on these manifolds may face optimization challenges. The computational cost could be high, especially for complex groups like SE(3). The proposal doesn't address potential numerical issues or computational requirements, which might be significant. Nevertheless, with appropriate expertise in differential geometry and deep learning, the idea appears implementable with current technology."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in generative modeling for scientific applications. By developing methods that respect the intrinsic geometry and symmetries of data, it could significantly advance fields like molecular modeling, 3D shape synthesis, and robotics. The potential impact is high because current methods often ignore geometric constraints, leading to invalid or inefficient results. The proposal explicitly mentions improved data efficiency and better generalization across group actions, which are critical advantages in scientific domains where data can be scarce. The framework could serve as a principled foundation for future work in geometry-aware machine learning. By unifying manifold diffusion and equivariant architectures, it contributes to the theoretical understanding of geometric deep learning while offering practical benefits for specific applications."
