        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The Geodesic Diffusion Models (GDMs) idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on geometry-grounded representation learning and generative modeling. It directly addresses the workshop's emphasis on maintaining manifold structure in generative models applied to non-Euclidean data spaces. The proposal fits perfectly within multiple solicited topics, particularly 'Dynamical systems on manifolds' (using SDEs on Riemannian manifolds), 'Generative modeling and density estimation' (generating geometric objects while preserving their intrinsic structure), and 'Structure-preserving learning' (maintaining the geometric properties of the data). The only minor limitation preventing a perfect score is that the proposal could have more explicitly addressed the workshop's interest in theoretical frameworks or physics-informed approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation clearly establishes the problem of standard diffusion models struggling with non-Euclidean data. The main idea articulates a concrete approach using geodesic-based diffusion, with specific technical components like the Laplace-Beltrami operator and exponential maps. The proposal outlines both the forward and reverse processes with sufficient technical detail. However, it could benefit from slightly more elaboration on the specific neural network architectures that would operate on manifold data, and more concrete examples of how the approach would be implemented for different types of manifolds. Some readers might need more background on concepts like the exponential map to fully grasp the approach."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by extending diffusion models to operate intrinsically on Riemannian manifolds. While there has been prior work on adapting generative models to manifold data, the specific approach of using geodesic-based diffusion with forward and reverse processes that explicitly respect the manifold structure appears innovative. The combination of stochastic differential equations grounded in Riemannian geometry with neural networks designed for manifold data represents a fresh approach. The score is not higher because there have been some related works on manifold-aware generative models and Riemannian diffusion processes, though this specific formulation and application to generative modeling appears to offer meaningful advances over existing approaches."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of the proposed approach faces several challenges. While the theoretical foundation is sound, implementing diffusion processes on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds requires sophisticated computational geometry tools. Computing geodesics, the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and exponential maps for complex manifolds can be computationally intensive and numerically unstable. The proposal assumes knowledge of the underlying manifold structure, which may not always be available or may need to be learned. Training neural networks to operate on manifold data and predict updates along tangent spaces adds another layer of complexity. These challenges don't make the idea impractical, but they do suggest significant implementation hurdles that would require substantial expertise in differential geometry, numerical methods, and deep learning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research idea is very high. If successful, it would address a fundamental limitation in current generative models when applied to non-Euclidean data. The potential impact spans numerous domains where data naturally resides on manifolds: molecular modeling, medical imaging, computer graphics, robotics, and more. By ensuring generated samples respect manifold constraints, the approach could lead to more physically realistic and valid generations. The method could enable new applications in drug discovery, protein design, brain connectivity analysis, and shape generation. The theoretical contributions to understanding generative processes on Riemannian manifolds would also advance the field's mathematical foundations. The approach aligns with the growing recognition that geometry-aware methods are crucial for many real-world applications."
