    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on spurious correlations and model instability by proposing a novel framework (ACA) that identifies and mitigates spurious features without requiring group annotations. The proposal incorporates the core concept from the research idea of using adversarial counterfactual augmentation and builds upon the literature review by positioning itself relative to existing approaches (e.g., EVaLS, SPUME, GIC). The methodology clearly outlines how the framework will identify potentially spurious features, generate counterfactuals, and retrain models with consistency regularizationâ€”all key elements from the original idea. The proposal also addresses the workshop's solicited topics, particularly 'Learning robust models in the presence of spurious correlations' and 'Methods for discovering and diagnosing spurious correlations.' The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review highlights challenges like evaluation metrics and benchmarks, the proposal could have more explicitly discussed how it addresses these specific challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The three-stage framework (Spurious Feature Identification, Counterfactual Generation, Robust Model Retraining) is logically presented with detailed explanations of each component. Technical concepts are explained thoroughly with appropriate mathematical formulations, such as the loss functions and attribution methods. The experimental design is comprehensive, specifying datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The proposal effectively communicates complex ideas like counterfactual generation and consistency regularization in an accessible manner. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for ensuring that generated counterfactuals preserve the true label while only modifying spurious features could be more precisely defined, (2) the relationship between the spurious feature masks and the conditional generative models could be elaborated further, and (3) some technical details about the implementation of influence functions for feature identification are somewhat underspecified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of several existing techniques into a cohesive framework for addressing spurious correlations without group annotations. The key innovation lies in the end-to-end pipeline that combines: (1) model-based spurious feature identification using attribution methods, (2) targeted counterfactual generation via conditional generative models, and (3) consistency regularization during retraining. While individual components like attribution methods, generative models, and consistency losses have been explored separately in the literature, their specific combination for addressing spurious correlations without group labels represents a fresh approach. The proposal distinguishes itself from prior work by focusing on targeted data augmentation rather than loss reweighting or group inference methods prevalent in the literature review. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that counterfactual data augmentation has been explored in related contexts (e.g., Reddy et al., 2023 mentioned in the proposal), and the use of attribution methods for identifying important features is well-established. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly articulating the technical innovations in the counterfactual generation process that go beyond existing approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates good technical soundness with well-justified methodological choices and appropriate mathematical formulations. The three-stage framework is logically constructed with clear connections between stages. The use of attribution methods for identifying potentially spurious features is well-founded in the literature, as is the application of conditional generative models for counterfactual generation. The consistency loss formulation is theoretically sound for encouraging invariance to spurious features. The experimental design includes appropriate datasets known for spurious correlations and relevant baselines for comparison. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal assumes that attribution methods will reliably identify spurious rather than causal features, but this assumption isn't fully justified; (2) there's limited discussion of potential failure modes where the generative model might alter causal features or create unrealistic examples; (3) the theoretical guarantees for the approach are not extensively developed; and (4) while the proposal mentions hyperparameter tuning, it doesn't fully address the challenge of tuning without group labels. Despite these limitations, the overall approach is methodologically sound and builds on established techniques in a logical manner."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan with some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the datasets mentioned (Waterbirds, CelebA, Colored MNIST, CivilComments) are publicly available and commonly used for evaluating robustness to spurious correlations. The attribution methods (Integrated Gradients, Grad-CAM) and model architectures (ResNet-50, BERT) are well-established with existing implementations. However, several significant challenges affect feasibility: (1) Training high-quality conditional generative models that can modify only spurious features while preserving label-relevant information is technically demanding, especially for complex datasets; (2) The proposal mentions potentially using pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion, but fine-tuning these for targeted counterfactual generation with mask conditioning would require substantial computational resources and expertise; (3) The effectiveness of the approach relies heavily on the quality of spurious feature identification, which may vary across datasets and model architectures; (4) The computational requirements for training multiple models (ERM classifier, generative model, robust classifier) on multiple datasets would be substantial. While the individual components are implementable, their integration into an effective end-to-end pipeline presents moderate to high implementation challenges that aren't fully addressed in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning: the reliance on spurious correlations and the resulting poor generalization to out-of-distribution data. This issue affects numerous real-world applications across healthcare, autonomous systems, and fairness-sensitive domains, as highlighted in the workshop description. The significance of the work is high for several reasons: (1) It tackles the practical challenge of improving robustness without group annotations, which are often unavailable in real-world settings; (2) It provides a potentially generalizable framework that could be applied across different data modalities and domains; (3) It bridges concepts from causality, generative modeling, and robustness in a novel way; (4) If successful, it could significantly improve model reliability in critical applications. The proposal clearly articulates these potential impacts and connects them to broader challenges in trustworthy AI. The approach also has potential for wide adoption due to its group-free nature, addressing a key limitation of many existing robustness methods. While the significance is somewhat tempered by the need to first demonstrate effectiveness compared to existing methods, the potential impact on both theoretical understanding and practical applications is substantial."
