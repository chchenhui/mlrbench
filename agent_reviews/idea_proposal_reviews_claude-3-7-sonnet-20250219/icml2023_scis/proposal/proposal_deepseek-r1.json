    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on spurious correlations and model instability by proposing a framework (ACA) that identifies and mitigates spurious features. The proposal incorporates the core elements from the research idea, including the identification of spurious features using influence functions, generation of counterfactual examples via conditional generative models, and retraining with consistency loss. The methodology is consistent with the literature review, building upon recent work in counterfactual data augmentation and spurious correlation mitigation while addressing the key challenge of not requiring group annotations (as highlighted in papers like EVaLS and GIC). The proposal also covers multiple domains (vision, NLP, medical) as suggested in the task description, with specific examples that match those mentioned in the workshop call."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with distinct steps. The mathematical formulations for influence functions, loss functions, and evaluation metrics are precisely defined. The proposal includes concrete examples of datasets and implementation details, making it easy to understand how the approach would be executed. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for determining which features are 'spurious' versus 'causal' in the identification phase could be more detailed, (2) the process for validating the counterfactual generation quality could be more specific, and (3) the relationship between the consistency loss and invariance could be further elaborated. Despite these minor points, the overall clarity is strong, with a coherent flow from problem statement to expected outcomes."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing techniques into a novel framework. The integration of influence functions for spurious feature identification with conditional generative models for counterfactual creation, followed by consistency-driven training, represents a fresh approach to addressing spurious correlations. The key innovation lies in automating the entire pipeline without requiring group annotations, which distinguishes it from methods like Group DRO. However, individual components of the approach draw heavily from existing work: influence functions have been used for feature attribution, conditional generative models for counterfactual generation, and consistency losses for invariant learning. The literature review shows similar approaches like EVaLS and SPUME that also aim to address spurious correlations without group annotations, though through different mechanisms. While not entirely groundbreaking, the proposal offers a novel combination and application of these techniques specifically tailored to the spurious correlation problem."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is built on well-established techniques like influence functions, gradient-based attribution, and diffusion models, all of which have solid theoretical backing. The mathematical formulations for the influence scores, adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, and the combined training objective are correctly presented and appropriate for the task. The experimental design includes proper baselines (ERM, Group DRO, SPUME, EVaLS) and evaluation metrics (worst-group accuracy, OOD accuracy) that align with standard practices in the field. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and offers mitigation strategies. The causal reasoning underlying the approach is sound, recognizing the distinction between spurious and causal features. One minor limitation is that the proposal could more thoroughly address the theoretical guarantees of the approachâ€”for instance, under what conditions the identified features are guaranteed to be spurious rather than causal. Overall, the technical approach is well-justified and rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant computational resources and expertise. The datasets mentioned (Waterbirds, CelebA, MultiNLI, NIH Chest X-ray) are publicly available, and the models proposed (ResNet-50, BERT, diffusion models) are established technologies. The implementation plan is divided into logical phases, making the execution manageable. However, several challenges affect feasibility: (1) Training diffusion models for high-quality counterfactual generation is computationally expensive and technically challenging, especially for complex domains like medical imaging; (2) Computing influence functions requires Hessian calculations, which can be prohibitively expensive for large models; (3) Ensuring that counterfactuals modify only spurious features while preserving causal ones is difficult without ground truth knowledge of which features are truly spurious. The proposal acknowledges these challenges and offers some mitigation strategies (e.g., using latent space techniques for diffusion models), but these challenges remain substantial. Overall, the approach is implementable but will require considerable resources and technical expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in machine learning: the tendency of models to exploit spurious correlations, leading to poor generalization in real-world settings. This issue is particularly important in high-stakes domains like healthcare, where model failures can have serious consequences. The significance of the work is enhanced by its focus on eliminating the need for group annotations, which are often unavailable or expensive to obtain in practice. If successful, the approach could make robust ML more accessible in resource-constrained settings. The proposal has both theoretical and practical significance: theoretically, it bridges gaps between causality, counterfactual reasoning, and invariance learning; practically, it offers a concrete methodology for improving model robustness across multiple domains. The potential impact extends to various applications mentioned in the task description, including medical imaging, NLP, and precision medicine. While the approach builds on existing work rather than introducing a completely new paradigm, its potential to advance the field's understanding and handling of spurious correlations is substantial."
