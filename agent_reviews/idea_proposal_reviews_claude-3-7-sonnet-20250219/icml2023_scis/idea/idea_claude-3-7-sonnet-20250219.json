        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on spurious correlations, invariance, and stability in machine learning. It directly addresses the call for 'methods for discovering and diagnosing spurious correlations' and 'evaluation and stress tests of model stability.' The causality-guided approach specifically targets the workshop's interest in relationships between causal ML and OOD generalization. The proposal acknowledges real-world impacts in high-stakes domains like healthcare, which matches the workshop's concern for 'real-world applications.' The only minor limitation is that while it mentions interpretability of results, it could more explicitly address how this connects to the workshop's interest in 'creating new opportunities for collaboration.'"

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a three-component framework with a logical structure. The motivation clearly establishes the problem of spurious correlations and their negative impacts. The main idea articulates a specific approach combining causal inference with adversarial techniques. The three components are well-defined: (1) identifying potential spurious pathways, (2) generating targeted perturbations, and (3) conducting sensitivity analysis. However, some technical details remain underspecified, such as how exactly the causal graph will be constructed from domain knowledge, what specific adversarial techniques will be employed, and how the sensitivity analysis will be quantified. These details would strengthen the clarity further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty by combining causal inference principles with adversarial stress testing in a systematic framework. While both causal inference and adversarial testing exist separately, their integration for specifically targeting spurious correlations represents an innovative approach. The use of causal graphs to guide adversarial perturbations is particularly novel, as it provides a principled way to generate meaningful tests rather than random perturbations. The focus on interpretable results that map to specific causal relationships adds another layer of innovation. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that both causal inference and adversarial testing are established fields, and the idea builds upon these existing approaches rather than introducing entirely new concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears feasible but faces some implementation challenges. Constructing accurate causal graphs requires substantial domain knowledge and may be difficult in complex domains. The proposal assumes that domain experts can provide reliable causal relationships, which may not always be the case. Generating effective adversarial perturbations along non-causal paths will require sophisticated techniques, especially for high-dimensional data. The sensitivity analysis component seems more straightforward to implement. The approach is likely implementable with current technology and methods, but would require significant expertise in both causal inference and adversarial machine learning. The proposal would benefit from more details on how to handle domains where causal relationships are uncertain or disputed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in machine learning: the reliance on spurious correlations that lead to poor generalization. The significance is particularly high given the focus on high-stakes domains like healthcare and criminal justice, where model failures can have serious consequences. The approach offers a systematic method to identify vulnerabilities before deployment, which could prevent harmful outcomes. By providing interpretable results that map to specific causal relationships, the framework enables developers to prioritize fixes based on real-world impact. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of motivating 'foundational research that is impactful in real-world applications.' The potential to improve model robustness across various domains makes this research highly significant to the field."
