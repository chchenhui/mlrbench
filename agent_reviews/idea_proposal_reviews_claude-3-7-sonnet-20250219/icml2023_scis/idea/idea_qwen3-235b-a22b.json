        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on spurious correlations, invariance, and stability. It directly addresses the core problem of models relying on spurious features rather than causal ones, which is central to the workshop's theme. The proposal specifically targets the examples mentioned in the task description: medical imaging (X-rays), and genomics (polygenic risk scores). The proposed Causal Invariance Testing (CIT) approach combines causal discovery with adversarial robustness to identify and mitigate spurious correlations, which matches the workshop's solicited topics on 'methods for discovering and diagnosing spurious correlations' and 'learning robust models in the presence of spurious correlations.' The only minor limitation is that while it mentions integration with domain-invariant representation learning, it could more explicitly address the workshop's interest in exploring relationships between causal ML, algorithmic fairness, and OOD generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The problem statement is well-defined, focusing on the automated discovery and mitigation of spurious correlations. The proposed solution, Causal Invariance Testing (CIT), is described with a clear two-step process: first using causal discovery to identify unstable causal relationships, then applying a causal invariance loss to enforce consistency. The expected outcomes are also clearly articulated with specific performance metrics (â‰¥15% accuracy gains). However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as how exactly the score-based causal discovery will work with high-dimensional data, and how the synthetic perturbations of spurious features will be generated in practice. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining causal discovery methods with adversarial robustness techniques in a novel pipeline. The automated identification of spurious correlations without manual labeling is an innovative approach that addresses a significant gap in current methods. The causal invariance loss that enforces consistency when spurious features are perturbed is also a fresh perspective. However, the individual components (causal discovery, adversarial robustness, domain-invariant representation learning) are established techniques in the field. The innovation lies more in their integration and application to the specific problem of spurious correlation detection and mitigation rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms. The approach builds upon existing work in causal inference and domain adaptation rather than introducing entirely new paradigms."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Causal discovery in high-dimensional spaces (like medical imaging) is computationally intensive and often requires strong assumptions about the underlying causal structure. The proposal mentions using generative models to create counterfactual examples by swapping spurious features, which is technically challenging, especially for complex data types like medical images or genomic sequences. While the individual components (causal discovery, adversarial training) have established implementations, integrating them into a cohesive pipeline that works across diverse domains will require significant engineering effort. The evaluation on multiple domains (radiology, genomics) is ambitious and will require domain expertise and access to appropriate datasets. These challenges don't make the research impossible, but they do suggest that considerable resources and expertise will be needed for successful implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is very high. Spurious correlations are a critical problem in machine learning deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and genomics. The proposed approach addresses a fundamental limitation in current ML systems: their tendency to exploit shortcuts rather than learning causal relationships. By automatically identifying and mitigating spurious correlations, this work could substantially improve model robustness, fairness, and generalization to underrepresented populations. The expected outcomes include not just performance improvements but also actionable insights into spurious dependencies, which could inform better data collection and model development practices. The potential impact spans multiple high-stakes applications where spurious correlations pose ethical and practical risks, directly addressing the workshop's focus on real-world impact. The work could significantly advance the field's understanding of how to build more reliable and fair ML systems."
