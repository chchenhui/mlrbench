        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the need for trustworthy and reliable large-scale ML models by focusing on machine unlearning for LLMs, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as a relevant topic. The proposal faithfully expands on the core idea of integrating PEFT techniques with gradient-based influence estimation for scalable unlearning, maintaining the key objectives of computational efficiency (<5% overhead compared to retraining), formal privacy guarantees, and preservation of model utility. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with appropriate citations to relevant works like Fast-NTK, LMEraser, and gradient-based approaches. The methodology section builds upon these existing approaches while clearly articulating the novel contributions of the PEFT-Unlearn framework."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the PEFT-Unlearn framework, including mathematical formulations and step-by-step procedures. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering datasets, models, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the distinction between Strategy A and Strategy B in Step 1 could be more clearly delineated, (2) some technical details about the influence estimation techniques could be elaborated, and (3) the theoretical analysis for differential unlearning guarantees is somewhat abstract and could be more concrete. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and follows a logical flow."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a novel integration of PEFT methods with gradient-based influence estimation specifically for LLM unlearning. While individual components like LoRA, gradient ascent, and influence functions have been explored in prior work, their combination into a cohesive framework for targeted unlearning represents a fresh approach. The two-step process of first isolating the influence of forget data into PEFT modules and then manipulating these modules for unlearning is innovative. However, the approach shares similarities with existing methods like Fast-NTK and LMEraser, which also leverage parameter-efficient techniques for unlearning. The proposal acknowledges these connections while emphasizing its unique contributions, particularly in the influence-guided PEFT module training and the exploration of formal unlearning guarantees. The novelty is significant but not groundbreaking."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness in its approach. The PEFT-Unlearn framework is built on solid theoretical foundations, including gradient-based optimization, influence functions, and low-rank adaptations. The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented. The experimental design is comprehensive and rigorous, with appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics that cover unlearning efficacy, model utility preservation, and computational efficiency. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and includes ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component. The section on formal guarantees shows awareness of the theoretical challenges in differential unlearning, though it could be more concrete in how these guarantees will be achieved. Overall, the methodology is well-justified and technically sound, with a clear path from theory to implementation and evaluation."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with some implementation challenges. The use of PEFT methods like LoRA is well-established and has proven effective for fine-tuning LLMs with minimal computational overhead. The experimental setup leverages existing models (Llama, GPT-2) and datasets, making resource requirements manageable. The step-by-step methodology is clearly defined and implementable with current technology. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) the effectiveness of isolating forget set influence into PEFT modules is an assumption that may not fully hold in practice, (2) achieving formal differential unlearning guarantees for LLMs is extremely challenging and may be overly ambitious, and (3) the evaluation of unlearning efficacy through MIAs and extraction attacks requires careful design to be meaningful. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal impractical, but rather highlight areas requiring careful attention during implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI trustworthiness with far-reaching implications. Effective and efficient unlearning methods for LLMs would directly impact privacy protection, regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR), bias mitigation, and overall model reliability. The potential impact spans scientific, technological, and societal dimensions. Scientifically, the work advances understanding of data influence in LLMs and parameter-efficient modifications. Technologically, it offers a practical solution to a computationally prohibitive problem, potentially enabling responsible AI practices that would otherwise be infeasible due to retraining costs. Societally, it contributes to safer, fairer AI systems by providing mechanisms to remove harmful, biased, or private content. The proposal's focus on benchmarking and open-source implementation further amplifies its significance by enabling reproducible research and practical adoption. The work directly addresses core themes in the task description regarding trustworthy and reliable large-scale ML models."
