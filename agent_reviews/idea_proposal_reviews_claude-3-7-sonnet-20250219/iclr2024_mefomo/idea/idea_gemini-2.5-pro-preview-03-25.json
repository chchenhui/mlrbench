        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on understanding foundation models, particularly in the 'Pre-Training' category. It directly addresses the sub-topic 'What subsets of the data are most important for the performance and capabilities of foundation models?' by proposing a methodology to investigate how specific pre-training data contributes to emergent abilities. The idea also touches on 'Analyzing learned representations' by examining how perturbations to representation components affect downstream performance. The proposal is highly relevant to the workshop's goal of developing better understanding of foundation models through careful experimentation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, hypothesis, and methodology. The approach of identifying pre-training data clusters, perturbing representations associated with these clusters, and measuring downstream impact on emergent abilities is logically presented. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific techniques to be used for representation perturbation (mentioned as 'inspired by representation engineering or causal mediation analysis' without further elaboration) and how exactly the pre-training data clusters will be identified. These details would strengthen the clarity, but the overall idea is still quite comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by combining representation analysis with targeted perturbation to understand data influence on emergent abilities. While representation analysis and data influence studies exist separately in the literature, the specific approach of perturbing representation components associated with data clusters to trace the impact on emergent abilities appears to be a fresh perspective. The research doesn't propose an entirely new paradigm but offers an innovative methodology to address an important question in foundation model research. The connection between pre-training data and emergent abilities through representation perturbation is a creative angle that extends beyond standard ablation studies."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate feasibility challenges. First, identifying meaningful pre-training data clusters requires access to the original training data, which may not be available for many foundation models. Second, establishing causal links between specific representation components and data clusters is non-trivial and may require sophisticated techniques. Third, selectively perturbing representations without disrupting the overall model functionality demands careful implementation. While the individual components (representation analysis, perturbation techniques) exist, integrating them effectively for this specific purpose will require considerable effort. The approach is feasible but will likely encounter technical hurdles that need to be addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical gap in our understanding of foundation models by investigating how specific data influences emergent abilities. The potential impact is substantial as findings could inform more efficient and targeted data curation strategies, potentially reducing computational costs while enhancing desired capabilities. Understanding these relationships could also help mitigate undesirable behaviors by identifying and potentially removing problematic data influences. The work could significantly advance both theoretical understanding and practical development of foundation models, aligning well with the workshop's goals of rigorous characterization of FMs and contributing to the broader goal of mitigating undesirable behaviors."
