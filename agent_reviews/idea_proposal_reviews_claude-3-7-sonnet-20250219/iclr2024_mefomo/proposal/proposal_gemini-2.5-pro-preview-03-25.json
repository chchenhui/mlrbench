        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding pre-training data influence on emergent abilities in foundation models. The methodology of representation perturbation analysis is fully consistent with the research idea of probing pre-training data influence. The proposal incorporates all key challenges identified in the literature review, including identifying critical data subsets, developing representation perturbation techniques, measuring downstream impact, addressing causal inference challenges, and providing insights for data curation. The proposal also cites and builds upon the relevant literature mentioned in the review, particularly Wei et al.'s work on emergent abilities and Du et al.'s research on understanding emergent abilities from the loss perspective."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction provides comprehensive context and motivation, while the methodology section details a step-by-step approach with mathematical formulations for representation extraction, cluster direction identification, and perturbation techniques. The experimental design is thoroughly explained with specific evaluation metrics and control conditions. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the precise criteria for selecting which layers to intervene on could be more specific, (2) the relationship between different perturbation techniques (ablation vs. steering) could be more explicitly compared in terms of expected insights, and (3) some technical details about handling potential confounding factors when attributing performance changes to specific data clusters could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to understanding foundation models by combining representation analysis with targeted perturbation techniques to establish causal links between pre-training data types and emergent abilities. While individual components like concept activation vectors and representation engineering have precedents in the literature, their application to quantify pre-training data influence on emergent abilities represents a fresh perspective. The methodology moves beyond correlational studies to a more interventionist approach, which is innovative in this context. The proposal's focus on identifying specific representation subspaces associated with data clusters and systematically measuring their impact on downstream tasks offers a new lens for analyzing foundation models. The combination of ablation and steering techniques to probe representation space is particularly innovative for understanding emergent abilities."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-grounded in established methods from representation learning and causal analysis. The mathematical formulations for representation extraction and perturbation are technically correct, and the experimental design includes appropriate controls (random directions, orthogonal directions) to validate findings. However, there are some potential methodological concerns: (1) the assumption that data clusters have linear, separable effects in representation space may be oversimplified given the complex, entangled nature of neural representations; (2) the causal claims might be stronger than what the methodology can support, as perturbation effects could be influenced by factors beyond the identified data clusters; (3) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of accessing the exact pre-training dataset, instead using proxy datasets which may introduce discrepancies. The inclusion of statistical significance testing and multiple control conditions partially mitigates these concerns."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable computational requirements. The use of publicly available models like LLaMA 2 or Pythia and open datasets like The Pile makes the research practically implementable. The methodology builds on established techniques (CAVs, linear probes) that have been successfully applied in other contexts. However, several challenges affect feasibility: (1) the computational resources required for processing large datasets and running multiple perturbation experiments across various models and tasks could be substantial; (2) identifying robust and consistent representation directions associated with specific data clusters may prove difficult in practice due to the entangled nature of neural representations; (3) the proposal requires expertise across multiple domains (representation learning, causal analysis, foundation model architecture). The research team would need to carefully manage these challenges, potentially by starting with smaller-scale experiments before scaling up."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research proposal addresses a fundamental question in foundation model research with potentially high-impact implications. Understanding how specific pre-training data influences emergent abilities could transform how we approach model training, data curation, and capability development. The significance is particularly high because: (1) it directly addresses a core workshop topic on understanding pre-training data influence; (2) it could lead to more efficient training strategies by identifying critical data subsets, potentially reducing computational and environmental costs; (3) the methodology could provide insights into model alignment and safety by revealing how undesirable behaviors might be linked to specific data influences; (4) the quantitative framework for measuring data influence could become a standard evaluation tool for foundation model development. If successful, this research could significantly advance our understanding of foundation models and inform more principled approaches to their development."
