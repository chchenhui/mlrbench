    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding foundation models, particularly in the pre-training aspect and emergent capabilities. The methodology thoroughly investigates how specific pre-training data subsets influence emergent abilities through representation perturbation techniques, which aligns perfectly with the research idea. The proposal cites and builds upon the literature review references, particularly leveraging insights from Wei et al. on emergent abilities, Du et al. on loss thresholds, and Zhang et al. on causal mediation analysis. The experimental design with models like LLaMA-2 and tasks from BIG-Bench directly connects to the workshop's topics. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions challenges in causal inference in representation space, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed how it overcomes these challenges."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated with distinct sections that flow logically. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented with appropriate technical detail, including mathematical formulations for representation perturbation techniques. The experimental design specifies models, tasks, and evaluation metrics. The expected outcomes and potential challenges are clearly outlined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The distinction between the three perturbation techniques could be more explicitly connected to their expected effects on different types of emergent abilities; (2) The validation process for cluster identification could be more detailed; and (3) Some technical terms (e.g., 'centered kernel alignment') are introduced without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong novelty in its approach to understanding emergent abilities in foundation models. While representation analysis and perturbation techniques have been used in other contexts, their application to systematically map pre-training data clusters to emergent abilities represents a fresh perspective. The combination of semantic clustering, probing classifiers, and three different perturbation techniques (ablation, projection, and gradient-based) creates a novel methodological framework. The causal mediation analysis applied to representation space is particularly innovative. The proposal extends beyond existing work by providing a quantitative framework to measure the influence of specific data subsets on emergent capabilities, rather than just observing that these capabilities exist (as in Wei et al.). However, some individual components (like probing classifiers) are established techniques, which slightly reduces the overall novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The representation perturbation techniques are well-formulated mathematically, and the experimental design includes appropriate controls and validation metrics. The use of causal mediation analysis provides a principled framework for attributing effects. However, there are some areas where the soundness could be improved: (1) The assumption that clusters in pre-training data map cleanly to specific regions in representation space may be oversimplified, as representations are often entangled; (2) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address how to handle confounding between data clusters; (3) The statistical analysis section could benefit from more rigorous methods for controlling false discovery rates when testing multiple hypotheses across different cluster-task pairs; and (4) The projection method assumes linearity in how representations encode information, which may not hold in complex neural networks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps, though it faces some implementation challenges. The use of publicly available datasets and established models (LLaMA-2, GPT-NeoX) increases feasibility. The clustering and probing techniques are well-established in the literature. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The computational resources required to analyze large foundation models (up to 70B parameters) are substantial and may be prohibitive; (2) Identifying clean, non-overlapping data clusters in diverse pre-training corpora is challenging and may not yield clear boundaries; (3) The causal mediation analysis assumes the ability to isolate effects of specific neurons, which may be difficult given the distributed nature of neural representations; and (4) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the challenge of over-perturbation affecting general capabilities. The mitigation strategies mentioned are reasonable but may require significant trial-and-error to implement effectively."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in our understanding of foundation models that has significant implications for both research and practical applications. Understanding how specific pre-training data influences emergent abilities could transform how we approach model training, potentially reducing computational costs and environmental impact by enabling more targeted data curation. The research could lead to more efficient training strategies, better control over model capabilities, and improved safety measuresâ€”all key concerns in the current AI landscape. The proposal directly addresses the workshop's call for understanding pre-training dynamics and emergent capabilities. The potential impact extends beyond theoretical understanding to practical applications in model development, alignment, and safety. The framework could enable targeted interventions to enhance desired capabilities or mitigate harmful behaviors without full retraining, which would be a significant advancement in the field."
