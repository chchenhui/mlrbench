    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding foundation models, particularly the question of 'what subsets of the data are most important for the performance and capabilities of foundation models?' The methodology of clustering pre-training data, analyzing representations, and conducting perturbation experiments to establish causal links between data types and emergent abilities is fully consistent with the original research idea. The proposal cites and builds upon the literature review references, including Du et al. (2024) on emergent abilities and loss dynamics, Wei et al. (2022) on emergent abilities in large language models, and Aghajanyan et al. (2021) on multi-task learning's impact on representations. The proposal's focus on understanding how pre-training data influences emergent capabilities directly addresses a key challenge identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the four-phase methodology (data clustering, representation analysis, perturbation experiments, and capability assessment) is thoroughly explained with appropriate technical details. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, such as the clustering function, representation extraction, perturbation methods, and the Ablation Impact Score for measuring causal effects. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the proposal could more explicitly define what constitutes an 'emergent ability' beyond the examples provided, (2) some technical details about the implementation of perturbations across different model architectures could be elaborated, and (3) the relationship between the proposed Ablation Impact Score and existing causal inference methods could be more clearly articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to understanding foundation models by establishing causal links between pre-training data subsets and emergent capabilities through representation perturbation. While representation analysis and perturbation techniques have been used in interpretability research, their application to systematically map data-capability relationships in foundation models is innovative. The proposal introduces several novel elements: (1) the combination of data clustering with representation analysis to identify data-influenced representation components, (2) the development of a comprehensive perturbation framework with multiple intervention types (ablation, noise injection, directional shifts), (3) the Data Influence Matrix for quantifying relationships between data clusters and abilities, and (4) the application of causal analysis techniques to establish data-capability links. The approach differs significantly from prior work that typically focuses on overall scaling laws or loss dynamics without isolating the effects of specific data types."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The four-phase methodology is well-grounded in established techniques from representation analysis, causal inference, and model interpretability. The mathematical formulations for clustering, representation association, perturbation, and impact assessment are technically sound. The proposal also includes appropriate control experiments to verify the specificity of findings. However, there are some limitations to its soundness: (1) the causal claims may be difficult to fully establish given the complex, interconnected nature of neural representations, (2) the proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address potential confounding factors in the representation-capability relationship, (3) the assumption that representation components can be cleanly associated with specific data clusters may be oversimplified given the distributed nature of neural representations, and (4) the statistical significance of the proposed Ablation Impact Score across different model sizes and architectures needs more rigorous justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan but faces significant implementation challenges. On the positive side, it leverages publicly available datasets (The Pile, RedPajama) and models (LLaMA, GPT-J, Falcon), and builds on existing frameworks for model introspection. The experimental setup with multiple model sizes and architectures is reasonable. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) the computational resources required for analyzing and perturbing multiple large foundation models (up to 70B parameters) are substantial, even with A100 GPUs, (2) identifying clean, interpretable associations between data clusters and representation components in highly distributed neural networks is challenging and may not yield clear results, (3) the proposed perturbation experiments require fine-grained control over model internals, which may be difficult to implement consistently across different architectures, (4) establishing causality rather than mere correlation between data types and emergent abilities requires careful experimental design that may be difficult to achieve in practice, and (5) the timeline for completing all four phases of the methodology across multiple models is ambitious."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental question in foundation model research with far-reaching implications. Understanding how specific data subsets influence emergent capabilities would significantly advance both theoretical understanding and practical development of these models. The potential impacts are substantial: (1) enabling more efficient training paradigms by identifying critical data for specific capabilities, potentially reducing computational costs, (2) informing targeted data curation strategies to enhance desired capabilities or mitigate harmful ones, (3) advancing model alignment techniques by providing insights into how data shapes model behavior, (4) contributing to interpretability research by establishing causal links between training data and model capabilities, and (5) potentially transforming how we approach foundation model development by moving from scale-focused approaches to more nuanced, data-aware strategies. The proposal directly addresses a key challenge identified in the workshop description and literature review, with implications for multiple research directions in the field."
