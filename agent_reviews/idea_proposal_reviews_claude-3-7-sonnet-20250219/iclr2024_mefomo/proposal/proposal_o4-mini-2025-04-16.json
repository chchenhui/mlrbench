    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on understanding foundation models, particularly in the 'Pre-Training' category and 'Understanding the data' sub-topic. The proposal investigates 'what subsets of the data are most important for the performance and capabilities of foundation models' as explicitly mentioned in the task description. The methodology follows through on the research idea of probing pre-training data influence through representation perturbation, maintaining consistency with the original concept. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with the proposal building upon Du et al.'s (2024) findings on loss thresholds, Wei et al.'s (2022) work on emergent abilities, and extending beyond CHORUS (Kayali et al., 2023) by dissecting which data subsets drive particular capabilities. The only minor inconsistency is that while Muppet (Aghajanyan et al., 2021) is mentioned, the proposal doesn't fully leverage its multi-task learning approach in the methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical approach is presented in a logical sequence from data clustering to subspace construction to causal mediation analysis. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly in sections 4.2 and 4.3 where the representation subspace construction and perturbation techniques are detailed. The experimental setup and evaluation metrics are thoroughly explained. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the ablation experiments and the causal mediation framework could be more explicitly connected, (2) The exact procedure for validating that the identified clusters truly represent coherent data types could be elaborated, and (3) Some technical details about how the forward pass would be implemented after perturbation (e.g., handling potential distribution shifts) are not fully specified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. It introduces a novel combination of techniques—data clustering, representation subspace construction, and causal mediation analysis—to investigate the influence of pre-training data on emergent abilities. The approach of using representation perturbation to establish causal links between data subsets and capabilities is innovative and extends beyond current literature. As noted in the proposal, 'No prior work has causally linked pre-training data subsets to emergent skills' and 'Representation-level perturbation methods have been applied to linguistic features but not to data-cluster subspaces.' The methodology adapts amnesic probing techniques to a new context, applying them to data-derived subspaces rather than linguistic features. While individual components (PCA, projection operators) are established techniques, their application to this specific problem and integration into a causal framework represents a fresh approach. The proposal doesn't completely reinvent foundation model analysis, but it offers a novel lens through which to understand emergent capabilities."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for subspace construction and perturbation are technically correct, and the use of causal mediation analysis provides a rigorous framework for attributing effects. The experimental design includes appropriate controls (random-subspace ablation) and statistical analyses. However, there are some limitations to its soundness: (1) The assumption that data types form well-separated clusters in embedding space may not always hold in practice, especially for heterogeneous documents, (2) The proposal doesn't fully address potential confounding factors—different data subsets might be correlated in complex ways that make causal attribution challenging, (3) The projection-based perturbation approach assumes linearity in how representations influence downstream performance, which may be an oversimplification given the non-linear nature of neural networks, and (4) While the methodology for measuring performance changes is clear, the causal interpretation of these changes requires stronger assumptions that aren't fully justified. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is methodologically sound and the limitations don't fundamentally undermine the research value."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. Using existing pre-trained models like LLaMA-7B and GPT-2 XL is practical, and the data sources mentioned (GitHub, arXiv, Reddit, etc.) are accessible. The technical approach builds on established methods (PCA, projection operators, causal mediation) that have been successfully applied in related contexts. However, several feasibility challenges exist: (1) Obtaining clean, well-separated data clusters may be difficult given the heterogeneous nature of pre-training corpora, (2) The computational resources required for running multiple ablation experiments across different models, layers, and tasks could be substantial, (3) Establishing causal relationships in complex neural networks is notoriously difficult and may yield ambiguous results, and (4) The proposal doesn't fully address how to handle potential distribution shifts when perturbed representations are fed forward through the model. Despite these challenges, the research is implementable with current technology and methods, though it may require refinement and optimization during execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in our understanding of foundation models that has substantial theoretical and practical implications. Understanding which data subsets drive emergent abilities could transform how we approach model training, potentially enabling more efficient, targeted data curation instead of relying solely on scale. The expected outcomes directly address key challenges in AI development: (1) Efficient FM Development—reducing computational and environmental costs by focusing on high-value data, (2) Safety & Alignment—identifying and removing harmful data subsets, (3) Theoretical Advancement—bridging empirical scaling laws with mechanistic understanding, and (4) Practical Tooling—enabling practitioners to probe their own models. These contributions align perfectly with the workshop's goals of developing 'understanding of FMs' and 'mitigating undesirable behaviors.' The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to industry applications, where more efficient training and targeted capability development could significantly reduce costs and improve model performance. The proposal could fundamentally change how we think about data curation for foundation models, making it highly significant to the field."
