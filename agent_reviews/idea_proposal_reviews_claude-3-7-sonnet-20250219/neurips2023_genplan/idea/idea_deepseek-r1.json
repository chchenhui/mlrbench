    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on generalization in planning and sequential decision-making. It directly addresses multiple key topics mentioned in the task description, including neuro-symbolic approaches, meta-learning for generalizable policies, hierarchical policies, and transfer learning. The proposal specifically targets cross-domain generalization, which is a central theme of the workshop. It also bridges reinforcement learning and symbolic planning, which matches the workshop's goal of synthesizing ideas from multiple research communities. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some specific topics like Q/V function generalization, though it does cover most of the workshop's themes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, articulating a well-defined problem (cross-domain sequential decision-making) and a specific approach (neuro-symbolic framework with meta-learned sub-policies). The proposal clearly outlines three key innovations and expected outcomes. The methodology involving symbolic planning with PDDL, meta-reinforcement learning, and formal verification is well-articulated. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific mechanisms of the 'bi-level optimization' and how the 'LLM-guided refinement' would be implemented. While the overall framework is clear, these implementation details would strengthen the clarity further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to combining symbolic planning with meta-learned neural sub-policies. The three key innovations mentioned (bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning for disentanglement, and neuro-symbolic plan repair with LLM guidance) represent fresh combinations of existing techniques applied to an important problem. The integration of formal verification with adaptable neural policies is particularly innovative. While individual components like meta-learning, symbolic planning, and LLMs have been explored separately, their integration in this specific manner for cross-domain generalization appears to be a novel contribution. The approach doesn't completely reinvent fundamental techniques but rather combines them in innovative ways to address an important challenge."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The feasibility of this research idea faces several challenges. While both symbolic planning and meta-reinforcement learning are established techniques, their effective integration presents significant technical hurdles. The bi-level optimization for aligning symbolic abstractions with neural capabilities is conceptually sound but likely complex to implement effectively. The formal verification module ensuring constraint satisfaction across domains adds another layer of complexity. The evaluation in ProcTHOR-like environments and robotics benchmarks is reasonable, but may require substantial computational resources. The LLM-guided refinement, while promising, depends on the capabilities of current LLMs for planning tasks, which remains an active research area. Overall, the idea is implementable but would require considerable expertise across multiple AI subfields and significant engineering effort."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: bridging the gap between data-driven reinforcement learning and symbolic planning for cross-domain generalization. The significance is high because success would advance deployable AI systems that can adapt to new tasks with minimal retraining, which has major implications for robotics and other real-world applications. The unification of planning and RL communities represents an important step toward more general AI systems. The approach tackles the critical issue of sample efficiency in RL while maintaining the generalization benefits of symbolic methods. If successful, this work could significantly influence how researchers approach the development of adaptive, generalizable AI systems for sequential decision-making tasks, potentially establishing a new paradigm for combining neural and symbolic methods."
