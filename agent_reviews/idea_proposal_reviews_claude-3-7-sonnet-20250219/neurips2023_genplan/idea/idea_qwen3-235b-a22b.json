        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on generalization in planning and sequential decision-making. It directly addresses multiple key topics mentioned in the task description, including neuro-symbolic approaches, meta-learning for generalizable policies, hierarchical policies, transfer learning, and few-shot adaptation. The proposal specifically targets the integration of deep reinforcement learning's short-horizon capabilities with symbolic planning's long-horizon generalization - precisely the complementary strengths and weaknesses highlighted in the workshop description. The only minor reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that it could have more explicitly addressed some specific workshop topics like generalized Q/V functions or domain control knowledge."

        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear high-level structure combining neuro-symbolic planning and meta-learning in a hierarchical framework. The motivation and expected outcomes are clearly stated. However, there are some ambiguities in the implementation details. For instance, while it mentions program induction and hierarchical task networks as potential mechanisms for discovering abstract subtasks, it doesn't specify which approach would be used or how exactly the symbolic planner would interface with the meta-learned neural policy. The proposal would benefit from more concrete details on the learning algorithms, representation formats, and integration mechanisms between the symbolic and neural components."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant originality by proposing a novel integration of meta-learning with neuro-symbolic planning in a hierarchical framework specifically designed for transfer in sequential decision-making. While both neuro-symbolic approaches and meta-learning exist separately, their combination for hierarchical transfer learning in this specific context appears innovative. The proposal goes beyond simply combining existing methods by suggesting a structured approach where symbolic planning provides abstract subtasks that guide meta-learned policies, creating a bidirectional relationship between symbolic and neural components. This integration strategy for cross-domain transferability represents a fresh perspective on addressing the limitations of both deep reinforcement learning and symbolic planning."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea faces moderate implementation challenges. While both meta-learning and symbolic planning have established methods, their integration in the proposed hierarchical framework presents significant complexity. The proposal requires solving multiple difficult problems: (1) automatically discovering abstract, composable subtasks via symbolic planning, (2) developing meta-learning approaches that can effectively leverage these symbolic structures, and (3) creating interfaces between symbolic and neural components that maintain the strengths of both. Additionally, cross-domain transfer (e.g., from navigation to manipulation) is an ambitious goal that may require domain-specific engineering. The idea is implementable with current technology but would require considerable resources, expertise across multiple AI subfields, and likely several iterations to achieve the promised benefits."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical challenge in AI: developing systems that can learn reusable skills and adapt rapidly to unseen tasks. If successful, this approach could significantly advance the field by bridging the gap between sample-efficient symbolic methods and adaptable deep learning approaches. The potential impact extends to numerous real-world applications, particularly in robotics and autonomous planning, where efficient transfer learning and rapid adaptation are essential. The hierarchical framework could provide a principled way to combine the complementary strengths of symbolic and neural approaches, potentially leading to systems with both strong generalization capabilities and the ability to handle complex, high-dimensional environments. This would represent a substantial step toward more human-like learning and planning capabilities in AI systems."
