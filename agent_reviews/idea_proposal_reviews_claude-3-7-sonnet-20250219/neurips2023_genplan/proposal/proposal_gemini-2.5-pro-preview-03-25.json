    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging deep reinforcement learning and symbolic planning for improved generalization in sequential decision-making. The proposed MeNeSyH framework incorporates all key elements from the original idea: hierarchical planning with meta-learned sub-policies, bi-level optimization for alignment, contrastive meta-learning for disentanglement, and neuro-symbolic plan repair with LLM guidance. The proposal thoroughly engages with the cited literature, building upon works like NeSyC and Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer while addressing the identified challenges of sample efficiency, alignment, generalization, verification, and computational complexity. The only minor inconsistency is that some technical details of the contrastive meta-learning objective could have been more explicitly connected to the cross-domain generalization goal."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The overall framework, research objectives, and methodological approach are articulated in a logical and coherent manner. The hierarchical structure of the MeNeSyH framework is well-explained, with clear delineation between the symbolic planner and neural sub-policy layers. The technical formulations, particularly for the contrastive meta-learning objective and bi-level optimization, are presented with appropriate mathematical notation. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for grounding symbolic predicates from raw observations could be more detailed, (2) the specific implementation of the bi-level optimization could be more concrete, especially regarding how gradients would flow between levels, and (3) the interaction between the LLM-guided plan repair and the symbolic planner could be more precisely defined. Despite these minor issues, the proposal remains highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents several novel contributions to the field. The most innovative aspect is the contrastive meta-learning approach for disentangling task-invariant and task-specific components of sub-policies, which is a fresh perspective on enhancing cross-domain generalization. The bi-level optimization for aligning symbolic abstractions with neural policy capabilities also represents a significant advancement over existing neuro-symbolic approaches, which often treat these components separately. The integration of LLM-guided plan repair into the neuro-symbolic framework is another novel element that leverages recent advances in large language models for improving robustness. While the overall hierarchical structure combining symbolic planning with neural execution has precedents in the literature (e.g., in the cited Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer), the specific combination of meta-learning, contrastive disentanglement, bi-level optimization, and LLM-guided repair represents a novel synthesis that advances beyond current approaches. The proposal could have scored higher if it had introduced more groundbreaking theoretical foundations rather than combining existing techniques in a novel way."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations from both symbolic planning and meta-reinforcement learning. The use of PDDL for the symbolic layer and meta-RL algorithms like MAML for the neural layer are well-justified choices. The contrastive learning objective is grounded in information theory principles, and the bi-level optimization approach follows a logical structure for aligning the two layers. However, there are some potential theoretical weaknesses: (1) the convergence properties of the bi-level optimization are not thoroughly analyzed, which could lead to instability issues, (2) the formal verification aspects are somewhat lightweight and may not provide strong guarantees about the neural components' behavior, and (3) the assumption that the contrastive objective will effectively disentangle task-invariant and task-specific representations lacks rigorous theoretical justification. Additionally, while the mathematical formulations are mostly correct, the InfoNCE loss formulation could benefit from more precise notation to clarify the sampling procedure. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is methodologically sound and well-reasoned."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the use of established simulation environments (AI2-THOR, ProcTHOR, VirtualHome) provides a practical testbed for the proposed methods. The modular design allows for incremental development and testing of individual components. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) The bi-level optimization between symbolic definitions and neural policies is computationally intensive and may require significant resources to implement effectively. (2) Training meta-RL policies across diverse environments for effective cross-domain transfer typically requires vast amounts of data and computation. (3) The integration of LLMs for plan repair introduces additional complexity and potential bottlenecks in real-time execution. (4) The contrastive disentanglement of task-invariant and task-specific representations may be difficult to achieve in practice, especially for complex tasks. (5) The proposal lacks specific details on how to handle the potential combinatorial explosion in the symbolic planning space for complex domains. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively suggest that fully implementing the proposed framework would require substantial resources and may need to be scoped down for initial implementations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: bridging the gap between symbolic planning and deep reinforcement learning to achieve human-like generalization in sequential decision-making. This problem is directly aligned with the workshop's focus and represents a significant research direction with broad implications. If successful, the MeNeSyH framework could substantially advance the state-of-the-art in cross-domain generalization and sample efficiency for complex tasks. The potential impact extends to practical applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and other domains requiring adaptive decision-making. The proposed methods for aligning symbolic and neural representations could influence future research in neuro-symbolic AI beyond planning. The contrastive meta-learning approach could also have broader implications for representation learning in RL. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on simulation environments rather than real-world deployment, and by the incremental nature of some contributions that build on existing methods rather than proposing fundamentally new paradigms. Nevertheless, the proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI capabilities and could significantly influence multiple research communities."
