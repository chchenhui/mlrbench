    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on generalization in planning and sequential decision-making by proposing a neuro-symbolic framework that bridges deep reinforcement learning and symbolic planning. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, and neuro-symbolic plan repair. It also builds upon the literature review by positioning itself relative to works like NeSyC, Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer, and VisualPredicator, addressing the identified challenges in sample efficiency, symbolic-neural alignment, and cross-domain generalization. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines from the literature review and addresses the core topics mentioned in the workshop description."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from motivation to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described with appropriate mathematical formalism. The NSHP-Meta framework's three modules are clearly defined, and the bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, and plan repair mechanisms are explained in detail. The experimental design section provides concrete information about datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for how the LLM-guided repair module interfaces with the symbolic planner could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the contrastive learning approach and the bi-level optimization could be more explicitly connected, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'abstraction parameters Ï†') are introduced without full explanation of how they are parameterized."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating several advanced techniques in a novel way. The combination of bi-level optimization for aligning symbolic abstractions with neural sub-policies, contrastive meta-learning for disentangling task-invariant features, and LLM-guided plan repair represents a fresh approach to the generalization problem in planning. The integration of formal verification methods with meta-learned policies is also innovative. However, many of the individual components build directly on existing work cited in the literature review, such as neuro-symbolic frameworks (NeSyC), hierarchical planning with transformers, and visual predicate learning. While the proposal creates a novel synthesis of these approaches, it represents an evolutionary rather than revolutionary advancement. The LLM-guided plan repair is perhaps the most original contribution, but even this builds on existing work in neuro-symbolic integration."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor in its approach. The mathematical formulation of the problem and the bi-level optimization scheme is well-defined and theoretically sound. The contrastive learning objective is properly formalized, and the integration with symbolic planning follows established principles. The formal verification component using SMT solvers provides a rigorous safety guarantee mechanism. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, multiple domains for testing generalization, and statistical analysis with significance testing. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) the convergence properties of the bi-level optimization are not discussed, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the contrastive meta-learning approach in disentangling task-invariant features could be more thoroughly established, and (3) the formal analysis of how the LLM-guided repair interacts with the verification system is somewhat underspecified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The individual components (symbolic planning, meta-RL, contrastive learning, formal verification) are all established techniques with available implementations. The datasets and environments mentioned (ProcTHOR, RLBench, grid-worlds) are accessible and suitable for the proposed experiments. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) the bi-level optimization between symbolic abstractions and neural policies may be computationally intensive and potentially unstable during training, (2) the integration of LLMs for plan repair, while promising, may face challenges in producing consistent, actionable suggestions for complex planning domains, (3) the formal verification component using SMT solvers may face scalability issues for large state spaces, and (4) the real-robot trials mentioned would require significant engineering effort to implement the full framework on physical systems. The proposal acknowledges some of these challenges through its ablation studies, which is a strength, but the timeline and computational requirements for the full implementation are not explicitly addressed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI: bridging symbolic planning and deep reinforcement learning to enable cross-domain generalization in sequential decision-making. This is a fundamental problem with wide-ranging applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and AI more broadly. The expected outcomes, if achieved, would represent a significant advancement in sample-efficient generalization and transfer learning. The 20% improvement in zero-shot generalization and 30% reduction in adaptation episodes would be substantial contributions to the field. The integration of formal verification methods also addresses the important concern of safety in deployed AI systems. The proposal has clear potential impact on both theoretical understanding (through the bi-level optimization and contrastive learning approaches) and practical applications (in robotics and autonomous systems). However, the significance is somewhat tempered by the incremental nature of the advances relative to existing work, and the fact that the proposed improvements, while valuable, may not fully solve the fundamental challenges of generalization in planning."
