    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on generalization in sequential decision-making by proposing a neuro-symbolic framework that bridges deep reinforcement learning and symbolic planning. The proposal incorporates all key elements from the research idea, including the bi-level optimization, contrastive meta-learning, and LLM-guided refinement. It also builds upon the literature review by extending concepts from NeSyC, VisualPredicator, and NeSIG while addressing the identified challenges of sample efficiency, symbolic-neural alignment, and cross-domain generalization. The methodology section thoroughly explains how the framework will tackle these challenges through its three-layer architecture. The only minor inconsistency is that while the proposal mentions formal verification, it could have more explicitly addressed the verification challenge highlighted in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the technical approach is described in detail with appropriate mathematical formulations. The three-layer architecture (symbolic planner, meta-learned sub-policies, and verification-refinement module) is well-defined, and the relationships between components are clearly explained. The experimental design section provides specific metrics and baselines for evaluation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism of the LLM-guided refinement could be more thoroughly explained, (2) some mathematical notations (e.g., in the contrastive loss function) could be better defined, and (3) the figure referenced in the text is not available for review, which slightly hampers understanding of the overall architecture."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel integration of several cutting-edge approaches in a way that hasn't been explored in the literature. The bi-level optimization for aligning symbolic schemas with neural sub-policies represents a significant innovation beyond existing neuro-symbolic frameworks like NeSyC and NeSIG. The contrastive meta-learning approach to disentangle task-invariant and task-specific policy components is particularly innovative and addresses a key challenge in transfer learning. The incorporation of LLM-guided plan repair is also novel in the context of hierarchical planning. While individual components (meta-learning, symbolic planning, contrastive learning) exist in prior work, their integration into a cohesive framework with formal verification represents a fresh approach to cross-domain generalization. The proposal builds upon rather than merely extends existing methods, positioning it as a meaningful contribution to the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations for meta-learning, contrastive learning, and bi-level optimization are technically correct and well-justified. The use of MAML for few-shot adaptation is appropriate, and the contrastive loss function follows standard practices. The evaluation metrics are well-chosen to measure the key aspects of performance. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address how the symbolic planner will handle uncertainty in the environment, (2) the formal guarantees of plan validity could be more rigorously defined, and (3) the exact mechanism for how the LLM-guided refiner interacts with the symbolic planner lacks some technical details. Additionally, while the bi-level optimization approach is promising, the proposal could benefit from a more thorough analysis of its convergence properties and computational complexity."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but faces several implementation challenges. On the positive side, the use of existing environments (ProcTHOR, Meta-World) and frameworks (PyTorch, PDDL4J) reduces development overhead. The experimental design is reasonable, with clear metrics and baselines. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) the bi-level optimization between symbolic schemas and neural policies is computationally intensive and may require significant resources, (2) training meta-learning policies across diverse environments typically requires large amounts of data and computation, (3) the LLM-guided refinement module adds another layer of complexity that may be difficult to implement effectively, and (4) achieving the ambitious performance targets (e.g., ZSSR > 75%, plan validity > 95%) may be challenging given the complexity of the proposed approach. While the individual components have been demonstrated in isolation, their integration into a cohesive system represents a substantial engineering challenge that may require more resources than implied."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: bridging the gap between data-driven reinforcement learning and symbolic planning for improved generalization in sequential decision-making. This aligns perfectly with the workshop's focus and represents a significant contribution to multiple research communities. If successful, the framework would enable AI systems to generalize across domains with minimal retraining, which has profound implications for robotics, autonomous systems, and other real-world applications. The expected outcomes—improved zero-shot generalization and sample-efficient adaptation—would represent meaningful progress on long-standing open problems. The proposal also has broader impacts beyond technical advancement, including potential applications in healthcare and disaster response, and fostering collaboration between RL and planning communities. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's comprehensive approach to addressing multiple challenges simultaneously (sample efficiency, generalization, verification) rather than focusing on a single aspect."
