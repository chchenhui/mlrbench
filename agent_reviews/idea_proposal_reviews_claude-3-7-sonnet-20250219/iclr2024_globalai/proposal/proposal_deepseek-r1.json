    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of Western-centric bias in generative AI systems identified in the task description and elaborated in the research idea. The proposal's three-component framework (Cultural Value Vectors, Differential Testing Protocol, and Adaptive Weighting Mechanism) directly implements the approach outlined in the research idea. The literature review is thoroughly incorporated, with explicit references to key works like Tao et al. (2023), Zhou et al. (2024), and Bayramli et al. (2025), using their findings to justify the research gap and proposed solutions. The proposal also addresses multiple themes from the task description, including cultural representation evaluations, culturally-rich datasets, and methods to study cultural values in AI."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The three main components of the framework are well-defined with specific technical details, including mathematical formulations for the Cultural Value Vectors and Adaptive Weighting Mechanism. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are explicitly outlined. However, there appears to be a minor formatting issue in section 2.2, where the numbering is disrupted ('2.2', followed by '2', then '2.2.1'), which slightly impacts the overall clarity. Additionally, some technical details, particularly regarding the implementation of the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism, could benefit from further elaboration on how it would work in practice across different types of generative models."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a fresh approach by integrating multiple techniques into a cohesive framework for addressing cultural bias in generative AI. The Cultural Value Vectors concept provides a novel mathematical representation of cultural dimensions, going beyond existing approaches mentioned in the literature review. The Differential Testing Protocol and Adaptive Weighting Mechanism also represent innovative combinations of existing methods. However, some individual components build upon established techniques (e.g., contrastive learning, attention pooling) rather than introducing entirely new methods. The proposal's primary innovation lies in its holistic integration of technical and participatory approaches rather than in developing fundamentally new algorithms. While it advances beyond the 'cultural prompting' approach mentioned in Tao et al. (2023), it shares conceptual similarities with some of the frameworks mentioned in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The mathematical formulations for Cultural Value Vectors and the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism are technically sound and build on established machine learning principles. The experimental design includes appropriate controls, baselines, and both quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics. The statistical testing approach using ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey tests is appropriate for the comparative analysis proposed. The multi-task loss function for training is well-formulated. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further theoretical justification, such as the choice of 128 dimensions for the cultural vectors and the specific formulation of the gating mechanism. The proposal could also more explicitly address potential limitations of the approach, such as the risk of overfitting to specific cultural patterns or the challenges of defining discrete cultural boundaries."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "While the proposal outlines a technically implementable approach, there are significant practical challenges that affect its feasibility. The data collection phase requires partnerships with cultural institutions across 10+ countries and collaboration with cultural experts for annotation, which would demand substantial resources and coordination. The recruitment of 500+ participants from diverse cultural backgrounds for user studies presents logistical challenges. The proposal also requires fine-tuning multiple large generative models (Stable Diffusion v3, GPT-4, and Llama 3), which would be computationally expensive and potentially limited by access restrictions for proprietary models like GPT-4. The creation of culturally annotated datasets at the scale needed would be time-intensive. While the technical components are theoretically implementable, the practical requirements for data, expertise, and computational resources make this a challenging project that would likely require significant funding and institutional support."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI development practices with far-reaching implications. As generative AI systems become increasingly embedded in global creative and communicative processes, ensuring cultural inclusivity is essential for equitable technology deployment. The potential impact is substantial, with the proposal claiming potential improvements for 3.6 billion non-Western users. The framework could significantly reduce cultural biases in AI-generated content, promoting more equitable representation across global cultures. The proposal also has policy implications, potentially informing regulatory standards for cultural inclusivity in AI as mentioned in reference to the EU AI Act and UNESCO's recommendations. Beyond the technical contributions, the proposal addresses fundamental ethical concerns about cultural erasure and power imbalances in AI development. The long-term vision of 'culturally aware' AI systems that dynamically adapt to local contexts represents a significant advancement in the field."
