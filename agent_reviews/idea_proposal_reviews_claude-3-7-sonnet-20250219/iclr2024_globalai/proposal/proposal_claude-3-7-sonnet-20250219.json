        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the challenge of Western-centric bias in generative AI systems identified in the task description and elaborated in the literature review. The proposed Cultural Calibration Framework precisely implements the three components outlined in the research idea: Cultural Value Vectors, Differential Testing Protocol, and Adaptive Weighting Mechanism. The proposal incorporates insights from the literature review, citing relevant works like Peters & Carman (2024), Tao et al. (2023), Bayramli et al. (2025), and Zhou et al. (2024) to establish the problem of cultural bias. The methodology addresses all five key challenges identified in the literature review: data representation bias, evaluation metrics, cross-cultural generalization, ethical considerations, and stakeholder engagement. The proposal also covers all the themes mentioned in the task description, including conceptual foundations, evaluation pipelines, culturally-rich datasets, methods to study cultural values, user interactions, and cultural impacts."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the three main components of the framework are thoroughly explained. The mathematical formulations for Cultural Value Vectors, Cultural Relevance Scoring, and the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism are precisely defined, making the technical approach transparent. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of data collection, vector extraction, testing protocols, and experimental validation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the Cultural Disparity Index and specific cultural contexts could be more explicitly defined; (2) the process for recruiting and compensating cultural experts and community members could be elaborated; and (3) some technical terms (like attention modulation in image generation models) might require further explanation for interdisciplinary audiences. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to addressing cultural bias in generative AI through several innovative elements. The concept of Cultural Value Vectors as mathematical representations of cultural dimensions is particularly original, offering a quantitative framework for what has typically been treated qualitatively. The Differential Testing Protocol introduces new metrics (Cultural Relevance Score and Cultural Disparity Index) that go beyond standard technical evaluations to specifically measure cultural performance. The Adaptive Weighting Mechanism's approach to dynamically calibrating model outputs based on cultural context while maintaining technical performance represents a significant advancement over existing methods. While some individual components build on existing work in bias mitigation and model adaptation, their integration into a comprehensive framework specifically targeting cultural dimensions is innovative. The proposal could have scored higher if it had more explicitly differentiated its approach from existing cultural adaptation techniques in AI or provided more details on how the Cultural Value Vectors improve upon existing cultural dimension frameworks in anthropology and cross-cultural psychology."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor in many aspects. The mathematical formulations for Cultural Value Vectors, similarity metrics, and adaptation mechanisms are technically sound and well-justified. The mixed-methods approach combining computational techniques with participatory methods is appropriate for the research objectives. The experimental validation plan includes appropriate controls, diverse model testing, and both quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods. However, there are some limitations to the soundness: (1) The proposal assumes that cultures can be discretely categorized into 10 regions, which may oversimplify the complexity and fluidity of cultural identities; (2) The optimization framework for balancing cultural relevance and technical performance needs more theoretical justification for why the proposed constraints would lead to optimal outcomes; (3) There is limited discussion of potential confounding variables in the evaluation process, such as language differences or socioeconomic factors that might influence cultural expressions; (4) The proposal could benefit from more rigorous statistical methods for validating the Cultural Value Vectors and ensuring they capture meaningful cultural dimensions rather than superficial correlations. These limitations somewhat reduce the overall soundness of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a comprehensive and ambitious research agenda that faces several feasibility challenges. On the positive side, the methodology is well-defined with clear steps for implementation, and many components build on existing techniques in machine learning and cultural studies. The phased approach focusing initially on specific domains before expanding is pragmatic. However, several significant feasibility concerns exist: (1) The scale of data collection (30,000 culturally diverse samples with expert annotations) would require substantial resources and coordination across multiple global regions; (2) Recruiting and maintaining engagement with cultural experts from 10 diverse regions presents logistical challenges; (3) The implementation of the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism for closed commercial models (like GPT-4 or DALL-E 3) may be limited by API restrictions and lack of access to model internals; (4) The proposal requires interdisciplinary expertise spanning machine learning, cultural anthropology, and human-computer interaction, which may be difficult to assemble; (5) The longitudinal assessment and continuous feedback integration would require sustained funding and infrastructure. While the research is technically possible, these practical challenges make full implementation as described somewhat difficult within typical research timeframes and budgets."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI development with far-reaching implications. As generative AI systems become increasingly embedded in global communication, education, and creative production, ensuring these technologies respect and amplify diverse cultural values is essential for their equitable function worldwide. The significance of this work spans multiple dimensions: (1) Technical significance: The framework would advance the capabilities of AI systems to operate effectively across diverse cultural settings, potentially establishing new standards for culturally-aware AI; (2) Ethical significance: By reducing cultural homogenization in AI outputs, the research directly addresses issues of representation and equity in technology; (3) Global impact: The framework could benefit billions of users from non-Western backgrounds who currently experience suboptimal AI performance; (4) Interdisciplinary significance: The work bridges computational methods with cultural studies, creating new methodologies for systematic integration of cultural knowledge into technical systems; (5) Long-term implications: The research could influence how AI systems are developed, evaluated, and regulated globally, potentially reshaping the relationship between technology and cultural expression. The proposal clearly articulates these dimensions of significance and provides concrete examples of expected impacts."
