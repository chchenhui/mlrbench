    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's themes of building globally inclusive AI, developing cultural representation evaluations, and studying cultural values in generative AI. The proposed Cultural Calibration Framework (CCF) with its three components (Cultural Value Vectors, Differential Testing Protocol, and Adaptive Weighting Mechanism) perfectly matches the research idea. The proposal extensively references the literature review, citing specific papers like Tao et al. (2023), Peters & Carman (2024), Zhou et al. (2024), and Bayramli et al. (2025) to justify the research gap and approach. It also addresses the key challenges identified in the literature review, particularly regarding data representation bias, evaluation metrics, and cross-cultural generalization."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and broken down into manageable components. The methodology section is particularly strong, providing detailed explanations of each phase of the research, including mathematical formulations for the Cultural Value Vectors and specific procedures for the Differential Testing Protocol. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further clarification, such as the exact implementation details of the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism and how the three components will be integrated in practice. Additionally, while the proposal mentions selecting 3-5 cultural contexts, it could be more specific about which cultures might be included and why."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel and innovative approach to addressing cultural biases in generative AI. While individual elements like cultural prompting (Tao et al., 2023) and cultural bias evaluation (Bayramli et al., 2025) have been explored in the literature, the integration of these approaches into a comprehensive framework with three interconnected components is original. The Cultural Value Vectors concept offers a fresh mathematical representation of cultural dimensions, and the Differential Testing Protocol provides a systematic evaluation methodology that goes beyond existing approaches. The Adaptive Weighting Mechanism represents a novel technical solution for dynamically adjusting model outputs based on cultural context. The proposal clearly distinguishes itself from prior work while building upon existing knowledge in the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded, with a strong theoretical basis drawing from cross-cultural frameworks and computational techniques. The methodology is rigorous, with clear phases and detailed procedures for implementation. The mathematical formulations for Cultural Value Vectors are technically correct, and the experimental design includes appropriate controls and evaluation metrics. However, there are some potential weaknesses in the technical foundations. The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully address the risk of cultural essentialism or oversimplification when creating vector representations of cultures. Additionally, while the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism is conceptually sound, the proposal presents multiple potential approaches without fully committing to or justifying a specific method, which raises questions about its implementation feasibility. The statistical analysis plan could also benefit from more specificity about sample sizes and power calculations."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a moderately feasible research plan, but with several significant challenges. The data collection phase for Cultural Value Vectors will require substantial resources to gather culturally diverse datasets and annotations, particularly given the participatory approach involving community representatives. The proposal acknowledges the need for ethical protocols and community collaboration, but these processes are time-consuming and potentially complex. The implementation of the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism presents technical challenges, as it requires modifying existing generative models without full retraining. The validation phase involving user studies across multiple cultural contexts adds another layer of complexity. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they collectively represent a substantial undertaking that may require more resources or time than implied. The phased approach does help mitigate some feasibility concerns by allowing for incremental progress."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in current AI research and development, with potentially far-reaching implications. As generative AI systems continue to proliferate globally, ensuring their cultural inclusivity becomes increasingly important. The Cultural Calibration Framework could significantly impact how AI systems are developed, evaluated, and deployed across diverse cultural contexts. The expected outcomes include not just academic contributions but practical tools and methodologies that could be adopted by AI researchers and developers. The proposal directly addresses the concerns raised in the workshop description about the risk of universalizing Western-centered AI and creating unforeseen impacts on global cultural production. By providing a systematic approach to cultural calibration, this research could help mitigate cultural homogenization and promote more equitable AI systems that respect and reflect diverse cultural values. The potential for both immediate practical applications and long-term theoretical contributions makes this research highly significant."
