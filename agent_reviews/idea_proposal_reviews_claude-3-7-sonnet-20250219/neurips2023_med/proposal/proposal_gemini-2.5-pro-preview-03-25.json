        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on bridging machine learning and medical imaging communities by tackling the challenges of data scarcity, robustness, and interpretability in medical imaging. The proposed Bayesian-Informed Self-Supervised Learning (BI-SSL) framework integrates self-supervised learning with Bayesian neural networks exactly as outlined in the research idea, including the specific target of +15% AUC improvement in adversarial robustness. The proposal thoroughly incorporates insights from all four papers in the literature review, citing them appropriately and building upon their findings. For instance, it leverages the Bayesian modeling approach from Gao et al. (2023), the uncertainty explainability concepts from Molchanova et al. (2025), the adversarial robustness and interpretability connection from Najafi et al. (2025), and the 3D self-supervised learning with Monte Carlo Dropout from Ali et al. (2021). The only minor inconsistency is that while the research idea mentioned multitask objectives as a core component, the proposal presents this as an 'optional' aspect in the experimental design section."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction provides comprehensive context, the research objectives are specific and measurable, and the methodology is detailed with precise algorithmic steps and mathematical formulations. The experimental design clearly outlines tasks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The proposal effectively communicates complex technical concepts like contrastive learning, variational inference, and uncertainty calibration. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The exact mechanism for integrating the uncertainty estimates with the explainability module could be more precisely defined beyond the three proposed strategies; (2) The proposal mentions 'anatomically-plausible augmentations' but could provide more specific examples of how these would be implemented for different imaging modalities; (3) While the evaluation metrics are comprehensive, the thresholds for success (beyond the 15% robustness improvement) could be more explicitly stated for other metrics like uncertainty calibration and interpretability assessment."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in its integration of self-supervised learning, Bayesian neural networks, and uncertainty-calibrated explainability specifically for medical imaging. The most innovative aspect is the uncertainty-calibrated explainability module, which aims to align visual explanations with model uncertainty estimatesâ€”a connection not well-explored in existing literature. The anatomically-aware data augmentations for self-supervised learning also represent a fresh adaptation of general computer vision techniques to the medical domain. However, the individual components (SSL, BNNs, explainability methods) are well-established in the literature, and similar combinations have been explored to some extent, as evidenced by Ali et al. (2021) who combined 3D SimCLR with Monte Carlo Dropout. The proposal builds incrementally on existing approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical frameworks. The novelty lies primarily in the specific synthesis of these techniques and their tailored application to medical imaging challenges, rather than in developing entirely new methodological approaches."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and is built on solid theoretical foundations. The self-supervised learning approach is well-grounded in established contrastive learning frameworks (SimCLR, MoCo), and the Bayesian neural network component is based on principled probabilistic methods (Variational Inference, ELBO optimization). The mathematical formulations are correct and clearly presented, particularly the contrastive loss function and the Bayesian inference equations. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, datasets, and evaluation metrics that align with standard practices in the field. The proposal also acknowledges potential limitations and offers alternative approaches (e.g., Monte Carlo Dropout as a computationally cheaper alternative to full Variational Inference). However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further theoretical justification: (1) The assumption that pre-trained weights from SSL provide a good initialization for the mean parameters of the variational distribution in BNNs could be better justified; (2) The proposal could more explicitly address potential challenges in optimizing the ELBO for complex medical imaging models; (3) The calibration strategies for aligning uncertainty with explainability could be more formally derived or connected to existing theoretical frameworks."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible research plan with clearly defined steps and reasonable resource requirements. The use of publicly available datasets (BraTS, ChestX-ray14, CheXpert) ensures data accessibility, and the proposed methods build on established frameworks that have existing implementations. The two-stage approach (SSL pre-training followed by Bayesian fine-tuning) is a practical strategy that allows for incremental development and testing. However, several implementation challenges may affect feasibility: (1) Computational cost: Variational Inference for Bayesian neural networks is computationally expensive, especially for 3D medical imaging models with millions of parameters. While the proposal acknowledges this by suggesting Monte Carlo Dropout as an alternative, the scalability of the full VI approach remains a concern; (2) Time constraints: The comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics (task performance, robustness, uncertainty quantification, interpretability) represents a substantial workload that may be challenging to complete within a typical research timeframe; (3) Expert evaluation: The proposed qualitative assessment with radiologists, while valuable, introduces logistical challenges in recruiting and coordinating with medical experts. Overall, while the core methodology is implementable with current technology and resources, the scope may need to be narrowed or prioritized to ensure complete execution."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses critical challenges in medical imaging that have significant clinical and research implications. By tackling the issues of data scarcity, robustness, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability simultaneously, the research has the potential to substantially advance the practical deployment of ML in clinical settings. The focus on enhancing trust through uncertainty-calibrated explanations directly addresses a major barrier to clinical adoption of AI tools. The data efficiency aspect could make advanced AI more accessible in resource-limited settings or for rare diseases with small datasets. The expected 15% improvement in adversarial robustness would represent a meaningful advancement in model reliability. The proposal also aligns perfectly with the workshop's goal of raising awareness about unmet needs in machine learning for medical imaging applications. However, the impact may be somewhat limited by: (1) The focus on specific imaging modalities and tasks, which may not generalize to all medical imaging contexts; (2) The potential gap between technical improvements and actual clinical implementation, which involves regulatory, workflow, and organizational factors beyond the scope of this research; (3) The incremental nature of the methodological contributions, which build on existing approaches rather than introducing transformative new paradigms."
