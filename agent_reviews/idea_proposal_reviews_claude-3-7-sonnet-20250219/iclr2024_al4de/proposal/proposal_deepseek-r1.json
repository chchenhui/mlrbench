    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on AI for differential equations, particularly emphasizing explainability and interpretability as highlighted in the task description. The proposal faithfully expands on the main idea of combining neural operators with interpretability methods through symbolic-neural hybrid models, attention mechanisms, and counterfactual explanations. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing the interpretability challenges identified in neural operators and incorporating elements from papers like LNO, RiemannONets, and PROSE. The methodology section thoroughly details how the symbolic-neural hybrid approach will be implemented, which is consistent with the neuro-symbolic AI approaches mentioned in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research questions and goals are explicitly stated in the introduction. The methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations for the symbolic-neural hybrid model, attention mechanisms, and counterfactual explanations, making the technical approach transparent. The experimental design, including baselines and evaluation metrics, is well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the specific mechanisms for integrating the symbolic and neural components could be more detailed, (2) the process for validating counterfactual explanations against ground truth could be more explicit, and (3) the proposal could more clearly articulate how the attention mechanisms will be evaluated for physical consistency."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining multiple interpretability approaches (symbolic regression, attention mechanisms, and counterfactual explanations) into a unified framework for neural operators. While individual components like symbolic regression (e.g., PROSE) and attention mechanisms have been explored in the literature, their integration specifically for neural operators solving differential equations represents a fresh perspective. The counterfactual explanation approach for DE solutions is particularly innovative. However, the proposal shares similarities with existing neuro-symbolic approaches mentioned in the literature review (e.g., paper #4), and the symbolic-neural hybrid concept builds upon established ideas rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. The novelty lies more in the comprehensive integration and application to scientific discovery rather than in developing entirely new algorithmic components."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The mathematical formulations for the symbolic-neural decomposition, attention mechanisms, and counterfactual explanations are well-defined and theoretically grounded. The use of established techniques like STLSQ for sparse regression and adjoint sensitivity analysis for counterfactual generation shows methodological soundness. The evaluation framework is comprehensive, including both quantitative metrics and qualitative expert assessment. The experimental design with ablation studies demonstrates scientific rigor. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges in the accuracy-interpretability trade-off. However, there are some areas where additional theoretical justification would strengthen the proposal: (1) formal guarantees on the convergence properties of the hybrid model, (2) theoretical analysis of how the symbolic components affect the generalization capabilities, and (3) more detailed discussion of how the attention mechanisms relate to the underlying physics of the differential equations."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it will require significant implementation effort. The individual components (neural operators, symbolic regression, attention mechanisms) have established implementations that can be adapted. The datasets proposed (benchmark PDEs and real-world climate data) are accessible. The evaluation metrics are measurable and appropriate. However, several aspects present implementation challenges: (1) balancing the symbolic and neural components may require extensive hyperparameter tuning, (2) generating meaningful counterfactual explanations for complex PDEs could be computationally intensive, (3) obtaining expert evaluations requires coordination with domain scientists, and (4) the integration of multiple interpretability approaches may lead to unexpected interactions. The timeline and resource requirements are not explicitly discussed, which would be important for assessing complete feasibility. Overall, while ambitious, the proposal appears implementable with appropriate resources and expertise."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in scientific machine learning: the lack of interpretability in neural operators for differential equations. This work has the potential for substantial impact across multiple scientific domains where differential equations are fundamental, including climate science, fluid dynamics, and materials design. By making neural operators more transparent and trustworthy, the research could accelerate the adoption of AI methods in scientific workflows where interpretability is essential for validation and discovery. The expected outcomes—particularly the ability to provide human-understandable explanations alongside accurate predictions—directly address the challenges identified in the literature review. The proposal's emphasis on both performance and explainability aligns perfectly with the growing need for responsible AI in scientific applications. The potential applications in education and ethical AI deployment further enhance its significance beyond the immediate technical contributions."
