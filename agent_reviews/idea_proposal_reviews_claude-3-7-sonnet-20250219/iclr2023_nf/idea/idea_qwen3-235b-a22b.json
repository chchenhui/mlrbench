        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns extremely well with the task description, particularly addressing the question 'What representation can we use for neural fields in order to extract high level information from them and solve downstream tasks?' The proposal directly tackles the challenge of extracting meaningful features from neural fields for downstream applications across diverse domains (medical imaging, climate science) which is explicitly mentioned in the task description. The idea also addresses cross-domain applications of neural fields beyond visual computing, which is a central goal of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some of the other questions posed in the task description, such as computation/efficiency improvements or evaluation metrics."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear problem statement, proposed approach, and evaluation strategy. The motivation is precisely defined: neural fields excel at representation but lack mechanisms for extracting semantic features. The proposed solution involving a hypernetwork and contrastive learning approach is described with sufficient technical detail. The expected outcomes and evaluation methods are also clearly stated. However, some technical aspects could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific architecture of the hypernetwork, how the contrastive learning objectives would be formulated mathematically, and more concrete details on the fine-tuning process for downstream tasks."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel approach by combining neural fields with self-supervised learning techniques to extract semantic features. The integration of hypernetworks with neural fields for feature extraction appears to be an innovative direction that hasn't been extensively explored. The application of contrastive learning specifically to neural field representations using spatial transformations as positive pairs is a creative approach. While self-supervised learning itself is not new, its application to neural fields for extracting task-agnostic features that can be used across diverse domains represents a significant innovation. The idea builds upon existing techniques but combines them in a novel way to address an important gap in neural field applications."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposed approach builds on established techniques (neural fields, hypernetworks, contrastive learning) which suggests implementation is feasible with current technology. The self-supervised learning framework is well-understood, and the extension to neural fields seems technically viable. However, there are several implementation challenges that might arise: (1) designing effective contrastive learning objectives for complex 3D or 4D data, (2) ensuring the hypernetwork can generate meaningful features across diverse domains, (3) computational requirements for training on high-dimensional data like 3D medical scans or climate data. The evaluation across multiple domains (medical imaging, climate science) would require significant computational resources and domain expertise. While challenging, these issues don't appear insurmountable with appropriate expertise and resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical limitation in neural fields that currently restricts their broader applicability across scientific domains. By enabling the extraction of semantic features from neural fields, the approach could significantly expand their utility beyond reconstruction to tasks like classification, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling. This directly addresses the workshop's goal of expanding neural fields to diverse domains including medical imaging and climate science. The potential impact is substantial as it could bridge the gap between the impressive representational capabilities of neural fields and the practical needs of domain scientists who require interpretable, actionable insights. If successful, this work could establish a new paradigm for using neural fields as foundation models across scientific disciplines, which aligns perfectly with the workshop's vision."
