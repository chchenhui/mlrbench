    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the application of neural fields to physics simulation through PDEs, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as one of the key application areas beyond visual computing. The proposal builds upon the research idea of combining adaptive activation functions with meta-learning for neural field PDE solvers, maintaining all core components mentioned in the idea (spatially adaptive activations, meta-learning for rapid adaptation, physics-informed losses). The methodology thoroughly incorporates insights from the literature review, citing and building upon works like Najian Asl et al. (2025), Iwata et al. (2023), Wandel et al. (2024), Wang et al. (2023), and Kashefi & Mukerji (2022, 2023). The proposal addresses the optimization challenges in PINNs highlighted in the literature review through its adaptive activation approach."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the context and motivation, while the methodology section provides detailed explanations of the network architecture, physics-informed loss functions, and meta-learning optimization procedure. Mathematical formulations are precise and well-presented, with appropriate notation and clear definitions of variables. The experimental design is comprehensive, outlining PDE families, data generation approaches, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact architecture of the modulation networks M_φ^(l) could be more explicitly defined; (2) The relationship between task parameters λ and the network's handling of these parameters could be elaborated; and (3) The specific implementation details of the first-order MAML approximation could be more thoroughly explained."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several existing approaches in a novel way. The integration of spatially adaptive activations via feature-wise modulation with meta-learning for PDE solving represents a fresh perspective not fully explored in the literature. The use of coordinate-based MLPs with adaptive activations specifically designed to handle multi-scale PDE phenomena is innovative. However, many of the individual components draw heavily from existing work: the meta-learning approach builds directly on MAML and recent meta-PINNs work (Iwata et al., 2023; Najian Asl et al., 2025), the adaptive activations concept extends Wang et al. (2023), and the neural field representation follows established practices. While the combination is novel and potentially powerful, the proposal doesn't introduce fundamentally new algorithmic components or theoretical frameworks beyond what exists in the literature."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and built on solid theoretical foundations. The physics-informed loss formulation correctly enforces PDE constraints and boundary conditions. The meta-learning approach follows established MAML methodology with appropriate inner and outer optimization loops. The neural field architecture with Fourier features is well-justified based on prior work showing their effectiveness for high-frequency functions. The adaptive activation mechanism is theoretically motivated by the need to capture multi-scale phenomena in PDEs. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, ablation studies, and evaluation metrics that will effectively test the hypotheses. The mathematical formulations appear correct and well-presented. One minor concern is that the proposal doesn't fully address potential optimization challenges that might arise from the interaction between the adaptive activation mechanism and the meta-learning procedure, which could lead to instabilities during training."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with current technology and methods, though it presents some implementation challenges. The core components—neural fields, physics-informed losses, meta-learning, and adaptive activations—have all been implemented separately in prior work, suggesting their combination is technically possible. The computational requirements, while substantial, are within reach of modern GPU resources, especially with the first-order MAML approximation to reduce memory usage. The experimental design is realistic, with well-defined PDE families and evaluation metrics. However, there are feasibility concerns: (1) Training meta-learning models for complex PDEs like Navier-Stokes may require significant computational resources; (2) The interaction between adaptive activations and meta-learning might lead to optimization difficulties not fully addressed in the proposal; (3) Generating high-quality reference solutions for the wide range of PDEs and geometries proposed will be time-consuming; and (4) The proposal doesn't specify how the task parameters λ will be encoded for different PDE types, which could be challenging to standardize across diverse equation families."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem with potentially high impact. Efficient and accurate PDE solvers are critical for numerous scientific and engineering applications, from fluid dynamics to climate modeling. The proposed MAANF framework could significantly advance the state of the art in neural PDE solvers by addressing key limitations of current approaches: slow adaptation to new conditions, difficulty capturing multi-scale phenomena, and poor generalization across geometries. If successful, the expected outcomes—rapid adaptation, multi-scale resolution, robust generalization, and computational efficiency—would represent meaningful contributions to both machine learning and computational physics. The potential for order-of-magnitude speedups in per-task training time would be particularly impactful for real-world applications. The broader impact section convincingly argues for applications in robotics, digital twins, and data-driven discovery of PDEs. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on moderate-dimensional PDEs (d≤3), whereas many challenging real-world problems involve higher dimensions."
