    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of expanding neural fields into scientific domains beyond visual computing, specifically focusing on PDE solving for physics simulations. The proposal incorporates the key elements from the research idea, including adaptive activation functions and meta-learning for neural field PDE solvers. It thoroughly builds upon the literature review, citing relevant works like adaptive activation functions (Wang et al., 2023), meta-learning approaches (Asl et al., 2025), and geometry generalization (Kashefi & Mukerji, 2023). The mathematical formulation is consistent with the physics-informed neural network approach discussed in the literature. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions benchmarking against baselines like Metamizer, it could have more explicitly addressed how it overcomes specific limitations identified in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and the mathematical formulation is precise, with well-defined equations for the neural field representation, physics-informed loss, adaptive activation, and meta-learning objective. The experimental design is thoroughly described, including specific benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. Implementation details are provided with sufficient specificity. The only areas that could benefit from additional clarity are: (1) more detailed explanation of how the hypernetwork for adaptive activation functions works, and (2) further elaboration on the specific meta-learning adaptation process for new boundary conditions. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is highly comprehensible and well-articulated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining two key innovations: spatially adaptive activation functions and meta-learning for PDE solving with neural fields. While both components have been explored separately in the literature (Wang et al. for adaptive activations, Asl et al. and others for meta-learning), their integration into a unified framework for PDE solving represents a fresh approach. The adaptive activation mechanism that modulates between ReLU and sine activations based on spatial coordinates is particularly innovative. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing methods rather than introducing entirely new concepts, and the meta-learning component follows established MAML methodology. The novelty lies more in the combination and application to physics simulation than in fundamental algorithmic breakthroughs."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established theoretical foundations. The physics-informed neural network approach is mathematically rigorous, with properly formulated loss functions that incorporate PDE residuals and boundary/initial conditions. The adaptive activation mechanism is well-defined mathematically, and the meta-learning objective follows the standard MAML formulation. The experimental design includes appropriate benchmarks and evaluation metrics that align with standard practices in the field. The implementation details are reasonable and feasible. The only minor weakness is that the proposal could benefit from a more detailed error analysis or theoretical guarantees regarding the convergence properties of the proposed method, particularly how the adaptive activations affect the optimization landscape."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with realistic implementation details. The architecture specifications (8-layer MLP with 256 hidden units) and training approach (Adam optimizer with specified learning rates) are standard and achievable. The hardware requirements (NVIDIA A100 GPUs) are appropriate for the computational demands of the project. The benchmarks (2D Navier-Stokes, 3D acoustic wave equation) are well-established test cases with available reference solutions. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) training meta-learning models for PDEs can be computationally intensive, potentially requiring significant resources; (2) the hypernetwork for adaptive activations adds complexity that might increase training time; (3) the expected 30% improvement in accuracy and 50% reduction in optimization time are ambitious goals that may be challenging to achieve consistently across different PDE types. Despite these challenges, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem with significant potential impact across multiple scientific domains. Successfully developing more efficient and accurate PDE solvers would benefit fields including fluid dynamics, climate science, and biomedical engineering. The proposal directly aligns with the workshop's goal of expanding neural fields beyond visual computing into scientific applications. The expected outcomes—improved accuracy for multi-scale phenomena, faster adaptation to new boundary conditions, and real-time 3D simulations—would represent meaningful advances in computational physics. The broader implications for interdisciplinary collaboration between machine learning and physics communities are well-articulated. While the impact would be substantial within computational physics and neural fields research, it may not be transformative for the broader machine learning field, which is why it doesn't receive the highest possible score."
