    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core concept of reincarnating RL by focusing on reusing prior computation while handling suboptimal data. The methodology specifically tackles the challenge of error propagation from flawed prior artifacts, which is highlighted in both the task description and research idea. The proposal builds upon the cited literature, particularly extending concepts from Agarwal et al. (2022) and Silver et al. (2018) on reusing prior policies, while addressing the key challenge of suboptimality mentioned in the literature review. The experimental design with controlled suboptimality injections directly tests the framework's ability to handle the challenges outlined in the literature review."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are presented in a logical flow. The technical formulations are precise, with well-defined mathematical notation for the uncertainty estimation and policy learning components. The algorithmic steps provide a clear roadmap for implementation. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the relationship between the distillation term and the old policy could be more explicitly defined, especially when only offline data is available without direct access to π_old, and (2) the exact mechanism for computing Q_π_φ via one-step backup could be elaborated further to ensure reproducibility."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel approach to handling suboptimal prior computation in reincarnating RL through uncertainty-aware distillation. While ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation and conservative offline RL are established techniques individually, their combination for retroactive policy correction in the context of reincarnating RL represents a fresh perspective. The reliability weighting mechanism (w_β) that dynamically adjusts the influence of prior data based on ensemble disagreement is particularly innovative. However, the core components (Q-ensembles, offline RL, policy distillation) build upon existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms, which somewhat limits the novelty. The proposal extends rather than revolutionizes current approaches to reincarnating RL."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and methodological rigor. The uncertainty estimation via Q-ensemble is well-grounded in Bayesian approximation theory, and the distillation objective effectively combines imitation learning with conservative value estimation. The theoretical considerations section provides a formal error bound that connects to existing offline RL theory. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, controlled suboptimality conditions, and evaluation metrics. The methodology carefully addresses potential sources of error propagation through the uncertainty-weighted distillation mechanism. One minor limitation is that the theoretical analysis could be more detailed in explaining how the reliability weighting affects the convergence properties of the algorithm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current resources and techniques. All components (Q-ensembles, offline RL, policy distillation) have established implementations in standard deep RL libraries. The computational requirements are reasonable, with a capped budget of 5k GPU hours on standard hardware (NVIDIA V100). The experimental design uses well-established benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo) with clear evaluation protocols. The implementation steps are detailed and actionable, with specific hyperparameters and training procedures outlined. The controlled suboptimality injections provide a practical way to systematically evaluate the method's robustness. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes ablation studies to guide hyperparameter selection, further enhancing its practical implementability."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in reincarnating RL: handling suboptimal prior computation. This is particularly significant as real-world RL deployments rarely have access to perfect prior data or policies. The potential impact extends beyond academic contributions to practical applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and resource management. The democratization aspect aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals, as the method would enable smaller labs to iteratively improve agents without prohibitive retraining costs. The standardized evaluation suite for reincarnating RL would provide lasting value to the research community. While the immediate impact is substantial, the proposal focuses on a specific aspect of reincarnating RL rather than transforming the entire paradigm, which slightly limits its overall significance."
