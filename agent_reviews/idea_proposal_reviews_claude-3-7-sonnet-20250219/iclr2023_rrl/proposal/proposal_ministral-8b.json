    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core challenge of reincarnating RL with suboptimal prior computation, which is explicitly mentioned in the task description as a key topic ('Challenges for dealing with suboptimality of prior computational work'). The proposal follows the research idea closely, maintaining the focus on distilling corrected policies from suboptimal data using uncertainty estimates. The methodology incorporates the two-stage approach (Data Analysis and Policy Distillation) outlined in the idea. The proposal also builds upon the literature review, particularly addressing the challenge of handling suboptimal prior data and balancing exploration/exploitation. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions computational efficiency as a key challenge, the proposal could have elaborated more on how the approach specifically addresses this challenge beyond the evaluation metrics."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated and logically organized. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the two-stage approach (Data Analysis and Policy Distillation), including a mathematical formulation of the distillation loss. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The exact implementation details of the ensemble of Q-networks could be more specific (e.g., network architecture, training procedure); (2) The hyperparameter Î» in the distillation loss formula could be explained in more detail regarding how it would be tuned; and (3) The proposal could more explicitly describe how the synthetic suboptimality will be injected into the prior data beyond the brief mention of 'partial observability or using stale policies.'"

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by addressing a specific gap in reincarnating RL: handling suboptimal prior data through uncertainty-aware policy distillation. While individual components like ensemble Q-networks for uncertainty estimation and policy distillation exist in the literature, their combination for retroactive policy correction in the context of reincarnating RL represents a fresh approach. The proposal builds upon existing work (as cited in the literature review) but offers a novel integration focused specifically on suboptimal data correction. However, the novelty is somewhat limited by the fact that ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation are well-established in RL, and the distillation approach shares similarities with Residual Policy Learning mentioned in the literature review. The proposal could have pushed the boundaries further by exploring more innovative uncertainty estimation techniques or distillation mechanisms beyond the standard ensemble approach."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and well-grounded in established RL principles. The two-stage approach is logically structured, with the uncertainty estimation via ensemble Q-networks being a well-validated technique in the field. The distillation loss formula is mathematically coherent and aligns with the goal of downweighting uncertain actions. The experimental design includes appropriate evaluation metrics and comparison with relevant baselines. The proposal also acknowledges the importance of testing across diverse environments (Atari and continuous control tasks) to ensure generalizability. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The proposal could benefit from a more rigorous theoretical analysis of how the distillation approach guarantees improvement over the prior policy; (2) There is limited discussion of potential failure modes or edge cases where the approach might not work well; and (3) The proposal could elaborate on how the method handles extremely poor prior data where most regions might have high uncertainty."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal is highly feasible with current resources and technology. All components of the methodology (ensemble Q-networks, uncertainty estimation, offline RL training, policy distillation) are well-established techniques with existing implementations. The experimental environments (Atari and continuous control tasks) are standard benchmarks with readily available codebases. The approach of injecting synthetic suboptimality into prior data is a practical way to systematically evaluate the method's robustness. The computational requirements, while not trivial, are reasonable for modern RL research and do not require specialized hardware beyond what is typically used for deep RL. The evaluation metrics are straightforward to implement and measure. The proposal also wisely limits its scope to a specific problem (suboptimal prior data) rather than attempting to solve all challenges in reincarnating RL simultaneously, which enhances its feasibility."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important challenge in reincarnating RL that has significant implications for the field. Successfully handling suboptimal prior data would enable more reliable and efficient reuse of computational resources, directly supporting the workshop's goal of democratizing RL research. The impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications where iterative improvement of RL systems is necessary but retraining from scratch is prohibitively expensive. The proposal could potentially bridge the gap between theoretical reincarnating RL and real-world deployment where prior data is rarely perfect. The significance is enhanced by the proposal's focus on robustness to different levels of suboptimality, which is crucial for practical applications. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on synthetic suboptimality rather than real-world examples of suboptimal prior computation, and the proposal could have more explicitly connected its contributions to specific real-world applications where the benefits would be most pronounced."
