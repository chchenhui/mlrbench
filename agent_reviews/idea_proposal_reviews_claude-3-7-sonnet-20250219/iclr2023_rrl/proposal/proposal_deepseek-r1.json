    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the core concept of reincarnating RL by focusing on reusing prior computation while handling suboptimal data, which is explicitly mentioned as a key challenge in the workshop description. The methodology incorporates uncertainty estimation to identify unreliable regions in prior data and uses distillation techniques to mitigate error propagation, which aligns perfectly with the research idea. The proposal also builds upon the literature review by addressing the identified challenges of handling suboptimal prior data and uncertainty estimation. The experimental design includes both discrete (Atari) and continuous (MuJoCo) control tasks, which is consistent with the examples mentioned in the literature. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions foundation models and LLMs as potential prior computation sources, the proposal doesn't explicitly incorporate these aspects."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering introduction, methodology, experimental design, and expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly enumerated, making the goals unambiguous. The technical approach is presented with precise mathematical formulations for both the uncertainty estimation and policy distillation stages. The experimental design clearly outlines environments, baselines, metrics, and statistical validation approaches. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for extracting policies from prior data when they're not explicitly available, (2) more details on how the uncertainty weighting mechanism adapts during training, and (3) clearer explanation of how the framework handles different types of suboptimality beyond the examples provided. Despite these minor points, the overall proposal is logically structured and readily comprehensible."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining uncertainty estimation with policy distillation specifically for handling suboptimal prior data in reincarnating RL. While ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation and policy distillation techniques exist separately in the literature, their integration for retroactive policy correction in the context of reincarnating RL represents a fresh approach. The uncertainty-aware weighting mechanism (w(s,a) = exp(-β · σ²(s,a))) for downweighting unreliable regions during distillation is particularly innovative. However, the core components (ensemble Q-networks, KL-divergence for distillation, CQL for offline RL) are established techniques rather than entirely new methods. The proposal extends existing work rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms, which somewhat limits its novelty. Nevertheless, the specific application to suboptimal data correction in reincarnating RL and the comprehensive framework for identifying and mitigating unreliable prior knowledge represent a valuable contribution to the field."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical soundness with well-founded methodological choices. The use of ensemble Q-networks for uncertainty estimation is theoretically justified and has precedent in Bayesian RL literature. The mathematical formulations for both the DQN loss and the uncertainty-aware policy distillation loss are correctly specified and build upon established techniques. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and metrics for evaluation, with proper statistical validation through Mann-Whitney U-tests across multiple seeds. The controlled injection of different types of suboptimality (stale policies, partial observability, biased action distributions) provides a rigorous framework for testing the method's robustness. The proposal also acknowledges the balance between RL and distillation objectives through the λ parameter. One minor limitation is that the proposal doesn't fully address potential limitations of the ensemble approach for uncertainty estimation in high-dimensional state spaces, which might affect scalability. Additionally, while the approach for handling discrete action spaces is clear, the adaptation to continuous action spaces could be more thoroughly explained. Overall, the technical foundations are solid and the methodology is rigorous."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan that can be implemented with existing technologies and methods. The core components—ensemble Q-networks, offline RL algorithms like CQL, and policy distillation—are established techniques with available implementations. The environments chosen (Atari and MuJoCo) are standard benchmarks with well-documented interfaces. The expected computational overhead (1.2× standard offline RL) seems reasonable given the ensemble approach. However, there are some feasibility concerns: (1) Training ensemble Q-networks on large-scale problems might require significant computational resources, potentially limiting accessibility for researchers with constrained compute; (2) The proposal mentions a 1.2× computational overhead, but ensemble methods typically scale linearly with the number of models, suggesting this estimate might be optimistic; (3) The controlled injection of suboptimality might not fully capture the complexity and diversity of real-world suboptimal data. Despite these concerns, the overall approach is implementable with current technology and methods, and the experimental design is realistic. The proposal acknowledges computational tractability as an expected outcome, showing awareness of potential implementation challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in reincarnating RL—the handling of suboptimal prior computation—which is explicitly identified as a challenge in both the task description and literature review. This work has significant potential impact in several ways: (1) It directly contributes to the democratization of RL by enabling researchers with limited computational resources to build upon existing work, even when that work is imperfect; (2) It provides a principled approach to mitigating error propagation in iterative RL development, which is crucial for real-world applications; (3) The framework could significantly reduce redundant computation in industrial RL pipelines by allowing safe reuse of prior work. The expected outcomes (15% improvement in severe suboptimality scenarios, 30% reduction in error propagation) would represent meaningful advances in the field. The proposal also has broad applicability across different domains and task types. While the immediate impact might be primarily in research settings, the long-term implications for practical RL deployment in robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems are substantial, especially in scenarios where prior computational work is available but imperfect."
