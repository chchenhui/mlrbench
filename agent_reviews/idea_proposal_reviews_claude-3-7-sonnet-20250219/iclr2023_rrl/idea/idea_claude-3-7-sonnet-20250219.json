        "justification": "The idea of a hierarchical skill library framework for Reincarnating RL aligns extremely well with the task description. It directly addresses the core challenge of reusing prior computation in RL, which is the central focus of the ICLR workshop. The proposal specifically tackles the issue of 'suboptimality of prior computational work' mentioned in the task description by introducing a scaffolding mechanism that evaluates and strategically deploys skills based on their quality. It also supports the democratization goal by enabling researchers with limited computational resources to leverage even imperfect prior computation. The idea falls squarely within the topic of 'Developing methods for accelerating RL training depending on type of prior computation available' - specifically addressing 'Learned Skills' as mentioned in the task description."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated and understandable. The hierarchical skill library concept and the scaffolding mechanism are explained with sufficient detail to grasp the core approach. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from further elaboration. For instance, the exact mechanisms for decomposing lower-quality skills into usable sub-components are not fully specified. Similarly, the automatic skill quality assessor is mentioned but its implementation details are not provided. While the overall framework is clear, these technical specifics would need further definition for complete understanding and implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea presents a novel approach to the reincarnating RL problem by introducing the concept of quality-aware skill scaffolding. While hierarchical skill libraries and policy reuse exist in RL literature, the innovation lies in the quality assessment and adaptive deployment of skills at different levels of abstraction based on their quality. The automatic quality assessor that determines how each skill should be incorporated without manual annotation represents a fresh perspective. The approach of using lower-quality skills as exploration guides rather than action generators is particularly innovative. The framework doesn't completely reinvent RL methods, but it does offer a new combination of concepts specifically tailored to address the varying quality of prior computation in reincarnating RL."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposed idea faces moderate implementation challenges. Creating a hierarchical skill library is feasible with existing techniques, but developing an effective automatic skill quality assessor that can reliably evaluate the applicability of diverse skills across different environments presents significant challenges. The proposal requires solving complex problems related to skill transfer, compatibility metrics, and automatic decomposition of skills into sub-components. These are non-trivial research problems that may require substantial algorithmic innovation. Additionally, the framework would need extensive validation across various RL domains to ensure its generalizability. While the core concept is implementable with current technology, considerable research effort would be needed to realize the full vision, particularly the automatic quality assessment and optimal skill decomposition components."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical problem in the field of reinforcement learning - the efficient reuse of prior computation. If successful, it could significantly advance the democratization of RL research by enabling researchers with limited computational resources to tackle complex problems. The ability to extract value from suboptimal prior computation is particularly significant as it aligns with real-world scenarios where perfect prior knowledge is rarely available. The framework could substantially accelerate RL training across design iterations and potentially enable continuous improvement of agents on problems with real-world impact. The approach also contributes to sustainability in AI by maximizing the utility of existing computational work rather than requiring constant retraining from scratch. Overall, the potential impact on both research accessibility and practical applications of RL is substantial."
