        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on connecting reinforcement learning and control theory. It directly addresses the workshop's emphasis on robustness, performance guarantees, and bridging theoretical approaches from both fields. The proposal specifically targets offline RL's reliability issues by incorporating control-theoretic uncertainty sets, which perfectly matches the workshop's interest in 'offline vs. online' approaches and 'performance measures and guarantees.' The idea also connects to the workshop's themes of stability, robustness, and fundamental assumptions about systems. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly discuss benchmarks for evaluation, though this could be addressed in implementation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (offline RL's vulnerability to distribution shift), the proposed solution (integrating robust control principles), and the implementation approach (learning nominal models with uncertainty sets and using minimax optimization). The methodology is well-structured with a logical flow from problem identification to solution approach. The only minor ambiguities are in the specific technical details of how the uncertainty sets would be constructed and how the minimax optimization would be solved in practice, though the proposal does mention potential approaches like robust dynamic programming and specialized policy gradient methods."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in its approach to combining offline RL with robust control principles. While both offline RL and robust control are established fields, their integration in the specific manner proposed—using control-theoretic uncertainty sets for offline RL policy optimization—represents an innovative direction. The approach of reformulating policy learning as a robust optimization problem over uncertainty sets derived from system identification techniques appears to be a fresh perspective. It's not entirely unprecedented, as some work exists on robust RL and uncertainty quantification in offline settings, but the specific control-theoretic framing and the focus on quantifiable robustness margins represents a valuable new contribution to the intersection of these fields."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate implementation challenges. The core components—learning dynamics models from offline data, estimating uncertainty sets, and solving minimax optimization problems—all have established methodologies in their respective fields. However, integrating these components effectively requires addressing several technical challenges: (1) accurately estimating uncertainty sets from limited offline data, (2) solving the potentially complex minimax optimization efficiently, and (3) ensuring the approach scales to high-dimensional problems typical in modern RL. The proposal acknowledges some implementation approaches but would benefit from more specific technical strategies for these challenges. Overall, the idea is implementable with current techniques but would require significant expertise in both RL and control theory."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses a critical challenge in deploying RL systems in real-world, high-stakes environments. The lack of robustness guarantees in offline RL is a major barrier to adoption in safety-critical applications, and this proposal directly targets this limitation. If successful, the approach could enable more reliable deployment of RL in domains like industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare—areas traditionally dominated by control theory approaches precisely because of their robustness guarantees. The integration of control-theoretic principles with modern RL could significantly advance both fields and potentially establish a new paradigm for reliable AI systems in critical applications. The impact extends beyond theoretical contributions to enabling practical, trustworthy AI deployment."
