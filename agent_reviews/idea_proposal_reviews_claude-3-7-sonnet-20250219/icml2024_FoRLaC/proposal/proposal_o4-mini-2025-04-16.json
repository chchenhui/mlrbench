    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on connecting reinforcement learning with control theory, specifically through Lyapunov stability theory. The proposal comprehensively covers the integration of Lyapunov functions into RL via neural networks, as outlined in the research idea. It builds upon the literature review by addressing key challenges identified (designing appropriate Lyapunov functions, balancing exploration and safety, etc.) and extends previous work by jointly learning policy and Lyapunov functions in a unified framework. The methodology section clearly demonstrates how the proposal implements the core concept from the research idea of training policies under Lyapunov constraints. The only minor inconsistency is that some of the cited works in the proposal (e.g., McCutcheon et al., 2025) have future dates, which doesn't align with the literature review's dating."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical formulation is precise, with well-defined mathematical notation for the MDP, policy networks, Lyapunov conditions, and optimization objectives. The constrained optimization framework and Lagrangian approach are explained thoroughly. The experimental design section provides comprehensive details on benchmarks, baselines, metrics, and implementation specifics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The transition from theoretical guarantees to practical implementation could be more explicitly connected, (2) Some technical details about how the Lyapunov network ensures positiveness and radial unboundedness could be elaborated further, and (3) The safe exploration initialization section is somewhat brief compared to other methodological components."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by introducing a unified framework for jointly learning control policies and Lyapunov functions via neural networks. While previous works have explored Lyapunov-based RL (as evidenced in the literature review), this proposal innovates by: (1) Formulating a constrained optimization problem that simultaneously optimizes for reward and Lyapunov stability, (2) Developing a block-coordinate update scheme that alternates between policy, Lyapunov, and dual variable updates, (3) Providing theoretical guarantees on both feasibility and near-optimality, and (4) Incorporating safe exploration mechanisms through pre-training and gradual constraint relaxation. However, the core concept of integrating Lyapunov functions with RL has been explored in prior work, and some components (like using Lagrangian methods for constrained RL) are established techniques, which limits the highest novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor and soundness in its approach. The mathematical formulation of the Lyapunov-constrained policy optimization is well-grounded in control theory and reinforcement learning principles. The Lagrangian formulation and block-coordinate updates are theoretically justified approaches for constrained optimization. The theoretical analysis section outlines clear assumptions and provides feasibility and near-optimality guarantees with appropriate convergence rates. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate benchmarks, baselines, and metrics. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The assumptions about universal function approximation capabilities of neural networks may be overly optimistic in practice, (2) The proof techniques are mentioned but not fully elaborated, and (3) The connection between the theoretical guarantees and practical implementation could be more explicitly addressed, particularly regarding how the sample-based estimates of expectations affect the theoretical bounds."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with existing technology and methods. The neural network architectures, optimization techniques, and experimental platforms (OpenAI Gym, MuJoCo, PyBullet) are all well-established and accessible. The implementation details provide concrete specifications for network architecture, optimization parameters, and training procedures. The safe exploration and initialization strategies help address potential challenges during early training. However, there are several feasibility concerns: (1) The computational complexity of jointly optimizing policy and Lyapunov networks while enforcing constraints may be substantial, (2) Finding initial Lyapunov functions that provide meaningful constraints without being overly restrictive could be challenging, (3) The proposal acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the exploration-exploitation tradeoff under safety constraints, and (4) The theoretical guarantees rely on assumptions (like universal function approximation) that may not hold perfectly in practice, potentially creating a gap between theory and implementation."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap between reinforcement learning and control theory that has significant implications for deploying RL in safety-critical systems. By providing formal stability guarantees for learned policies, this research could enable the application of RL in domains previously restricted to classical control approaches, such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and robotic systems. The theoretical contributions advance our understanding of how to integrate stability constraints into learning algorithms, while the practical implementation demonstrates a pathway to real-world deployment. The broader impact section convincingly argues for the transformative potential of this work in enabling trustworthy autonomous systems. The significance is further enhanced by the proposal's alignment with the workshop's goal of fostering connections between RL and control theory communities. The only limitation to its significance is that the initial applications are in simulation environments rather than real-world systems, though this is a reasonable first step."
