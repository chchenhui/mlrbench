    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on AI applications in finance. It specifically addresses risk management, which is explicitly mentioned as a topic of interest. The proposal leverages generative AI (diffusion models) for financial time-series modeling, which directly matches two key areas highlighted in the workshop description. The idea also touches on practical financial applications through its focus on Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall calculations, making it highly relevant to the workshop's scope. The only minor reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that it doesn't explicitly address the 'responsible AI' component mentioned in the workshop title, though the goal of improving risk management does indirectly support responsible financial practices."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (underrepresentation of tail events in historical data), the proposed solution (conditional diffusion model for synthetic scenario generation), and the evaluation approach (backtesting failure rates, capital requirement accuracy). The technical approach is well-defined, specifying both inputs (price, volatility, interest rates, external indicators) and outputs (synthetic paths reflecting stress conditions). However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as the specific architecture of the diffusion model, how the conditioning mechanism works precisely, and more details on the evaluation metrics. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in applying diffusion models to financial stress testing and risk management. While generative models have been applied to financial time series before, the specific application to tail-risk modeling and stress testing using conditional diffusion models represents a fresh approach. The ability to specify stress intensities as conditioning factors is particularly innovative. However, the core techniques (diffusion models, conditional generation) are established in other domains, and similar approaches using GANs or other generative models have been explored in finance, which is why it doesn't receive a higher novelty score. The innovation lies more in the application and integration than in fundamental algorithmic advances."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible with current technology and methods. Diffusion models are well-established, and the financial data required (price series, volatility measures, interest rates, macroeconomic indicators) is generally available. The evaluation metrics proposed (backtesting failure rates, capital requirement accuracy) are standard in the industry. However, there are implementation challenges that prevent a higher score: (1) ensuring the generated scenarios are both extreme yet realistic requires careful validation, (2) financial time series have complex dependencies that may be difficult to capture accurately, (3) regulatory acceptance of synthetic data for risk modeling would require extensive validation, and (4) the computational resources needed for training diffusion models on high-dimensional financial data could be substantial."
    },
    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea addresses a significant problem in financial risk management. Accurate tail risk estimation is crucial for financial stability, and current methods often struggle with limited historical extreme events. If successful, this approach could substantially improve risk model calibration, potentially preventing undercapitalization during market stress and reducing unnecessary capital buffers during normal times. The democratization aspect—making sophisticated stress testing available to smaller institutions—further enhances its significance. The impact would extend beyond individual institutions to potentially improving systemic financial stability. It doesn't receive a perfect score because the approach is still focused on a specific application area rather than transforming the entire field of financial AI, and its real-world adoption would depend on regulatory acceptance."
