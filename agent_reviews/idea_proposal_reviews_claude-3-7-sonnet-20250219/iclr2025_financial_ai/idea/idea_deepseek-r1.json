    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the workshop's focus on 'Advances in Financial AI.' It directly addresses several key topics mentioned in the task description, including generative AI applications in finance, time-series modeling, and practical financial applications like forecasting and risk management. The proposal specifically targets financial time-series data augmentation to improve forecasting robustness, which is highly relevant to the workshop's interests. The only minor reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that it could more explicitly address the 'Responsible AI' component mentioned in the workshop title, though it does touch on privacy preservation."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated with a clear structure covering motivation, main idea, and expected impact. The technical approach is specified with concrete components (diffusion models, attention mechanisms, stochastic volatility modules) and evaluation methods. The objectives and potential applications are well-defined. However, some technical details could benefit from further elaboration, such as the specific architecture of the diffusion model, how the stochastic volatility modules will be implemented, and more details on the evaluation metrics for the generated data beyond mentioning 'structural metrics.'"

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by applying diffusion models to financial time-series data, which is a relatively unexplored application compared to their use in image and audio generation. The integration of stochastic volatility modules specifically designed for financial data patterns is innovative. However, diffusion models themselves are not new, and the application of generative models to time-series augmentation has been explored with other architectures like GANs. The adversarial training component also borrows from established techniques. The novelty lies more in the specific combination and adaptation of these methods to financial time-series rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is largely feasible with current technology and methods. Diffusion models have proven effective in other domains, and the necessary components (attention mechanisms, adversarial training) are well-established. The availability of benchmark datasets like M4 Finance facilitates evaluation. However, there are moderate challenges: (1) diffusion models are computationally intensive and may require significant resources for training on long financial time-series, (2) capturing the complex dependencies and non-stationarity of financial data is inherently difficult, and (3) evaluating the quality of synthetic financial data is non-trivial and may require domain-specific metrics beyond those mentioned. These challenges are surmountable but will require careful implementation and possibly iterative refinement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research has significant potential impact in the financial domain. If successful, it would address important challenges in financial forecasting, particularly for data-scarce scenarios like emerging markets or rare events. The privacy-preserving aspect is especially valuable for financial institutions dealing with sensitive data. Improved forecasting robustness could lead to better risk management and investment strategies with real-world financial benefits. The approach could also generalize to other domains with similar time-series characteristics. While the impact would be substantial within financial AI, it may have somewhat limited broader impact outside this specific domain, which prevents it from scoring a 9 or 10."
