        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the TRL workshop's focus on representation learning for structured data. It directly addresses the workshop's goal of advancing table representation learning by proposing a novel dual-stream transformer architecture specifically designed to handle complex table structures. The idea tackles the challenge of encoding both content and structural metadata of tables, which is a core concern mentioned in the workshop topics. It also targets applications like text-to-SQL and data QA that are explicitly listed as relevant applications in the workshop description. The proposal addresses multimodal learning by combining structured data with text (SQL queries), which is another topic of interest for the workshop."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. The motivation is well-articulated, identifying a specific problem (LLMs struggling with complex table structures) and its consequences. The dual-stream approach is clearly defined with distinct components (content stream and structure stream) and their respective functions. The pretraining tasks are explicitly enumerated. The expected outcomes and evaluation benchmarks are also specified. However, some technical details could be further elaborated, such as how exactly the structural position embeddings work, how the schema graphs are constructed and learned, and what specific mechanisms enable the cross-stream alignment. These minor ambiguities prevent it from receiving a perfect clarity score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to table representation learning. The dual-stream architecture that separately but jointly processes content and structure is an innovative approach to the problem. The concept of learnable schema graphs for encoding metadata hierarchically appears to be a fresh perspective. However, the core components build upon existing transformer architectures and established pretraining paradigms. The masked cell recovery task is similar to masked language modeling used in many existing models. While the combination and specific application to tabular data is novel, the fundamental techniques draw significantly from existing approaches in the field. The idea represents an innovative extension and adaptation rather than a groundbreaking new paradigm."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. Transformer architectures are well-established, and the proposed extensions build on existing techniques. The pretraining tasks are clearly defined and implementable. The evaluation benchmarks (Spider, WikiTableQuestions) are established datasets with known metrics. The dual-stream approach might require significant computational resources for training, but this is within the capabilities of modern research infrastructure. Some engineering challenges might arise in efficiently implementing the schema graph learning and cross-stream alignment, but these appear surmountable with current methods. The proposal doesn't rely on any theoretical breakthroughs or unavailable technologies, making it quite practical to implement."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a significant problem in the field of table representation learning. Improving LLMs' ability to understand complex table structures has wide-ranging implications for numerous applications including text-to-SQL, data QA, and other data-driven NLP systems. The potential impact extends to enterprise applications, data analysis pipelines, and information retrieval systems that rely on structured data. The workshop explicitly mentions these applications as important areas. If successful, this approach could substantially advance the state-of-the-art in table understanding and reasoning. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on specific benchmarks rather than demonstrating broader generalizability across diverse real-world scenarios, but the core problem being addressed is undeniably important."
