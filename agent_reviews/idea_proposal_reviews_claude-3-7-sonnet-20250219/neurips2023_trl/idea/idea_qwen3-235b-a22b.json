    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the TRL workshop's focus areas. It directly addresses multimodal learning combining tables with text, which is explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal targets table representation learning with graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment, which fits perfectly with the workshop's goal of advancing structured data as a primary modality. The application areas mentioned (text-to-SQL, table QA, fact-checking) are specifically listed in the workshop's scope under 'Applications of TRL models'. The idea also addresses the challenge of heterogeneous table structures, which aligns with the workshop's interest in model robustness for messy and heterogeneous tabular data."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (bridging structured tables with unstructured text), the proposed solution (graph-enhanced framework with heterogeneous GNNs and cross-modal attention), the methodology (pre-training on table-text pairs followed by fine-tuning), and expected outcomes (improved results on specific benchmarks). The technical approach is well-defined, explaining how tables will be encoded as graphs and aligned with text representations. The only minor ambiguities are in the specifics of the cross-modal attention mechanism and exactly how the contrastive learning objective would be formulated, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to table-text understanding. The use of heterogeneous graph neural networks to capture the complex relationships within tables (row-column hierarchies, foreign keys, metadata) and then aligning these with text via cross-modal attention is a fresh combination of existing techniques. While graph neural networks for tables and cross-modal learning are not entirely new concepts individually, their integration for table-text understanding, particularly with the focus on capturing relational semantics that are lost in flattened representations, offers a novel perspective. The idea builds upon existing work rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking concept, which is why it scores a 7 rather than higher."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is highly feasible with current technology and methods. Graph neural networks, transformer models, and contrastive learning are all well-established techniques with mature implementations available. The data sources mentioned (Wikipedia infoboxes with article text) are publicly accessible for pre-training. The evaluation benchmarks (WikiTQ, HybridQA) are standard in the field. The main implementation challenges would likely be in the design of the heterogeneous graph representation for diverse table structures and the cross-modal attention mechanism, but these are reasonable extensions of existing approaches rather than fundamental obstacles. The computational resources required for pre-training on large-scale table-text pairs might be substantial but are within reach of academic or industry research labs."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses an important problem in multimodal learning with significant practical implications. Tables are ubiquitous in data analysis across domains, and improving the joint understanding of tables and text could advance numerous applications mentioned in the workshop description, including data search, fact-checking, and text-to-SQL. The approach could potentially bridge the gap between NLP and structured data understanding, which is a key goal of the TRL workshop. The impact would extend beyond academic benchmarks to real-world applications like interactive data analysis assistants. The significance is particularly high given the workshop's explicit focus on multimodal learning where structured data is combined with text. The score is not higher only because the idea focuses on a specific technical approach rather than proposing a paradigm shift in how we think about table representation learning."
