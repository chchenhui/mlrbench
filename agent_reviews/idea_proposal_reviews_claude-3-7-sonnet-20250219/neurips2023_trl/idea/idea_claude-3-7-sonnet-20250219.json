        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The TabAlign research idea aligns excellently with the TRL workshop's focus areas. It directly addresses representation learning for structured data (tables) which is a primary topic of interest. The proposal specifically targets semantic relationships between tables, which falls under data integration and discovery - key applications mentioned in the workshop description. The contrastive learning approach for table representation learning matches the workshop's interest in new model architectures and encoding techniques. The idea also addresses cross-domain applications including data discovery and schema matching, which aligns with the workshop's interest in data preparation, retrieval, and integration applications."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity. It clearly articulates the problem (understanding semantic relationships between tables), the proposed solution (contrastive learning framework with dual-encoder architecture), and the expected applications. The technical approach involving table-specific attention mechanisms focusing on key columns, headers, and data distributions is well-defined. The incorporation of weak supervision signals is also clearly explained. The only minor ambiguity is in the details of how the table-specific attention mechanisms will be implemented and how exactly the weak supervision from existing tools will be integrated, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "TabAlign demonstrates good novelty in its approach to table representation learning. The use of contrastive learning specifically for table semantic alignment with table-specific attention mechanisms that focus on structural elements rather than just textual content represents a fresh perspective. However, contrastive learning itself is a well-established technique in representation learning, and dual-encoder architectures have been applied to various domains before. The innovation comes from the specific application to tables and the incorporation of table-specific features, but it builds upon existing methodological foundations rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. Contrastive learning frameworks are well-established, and the necessary components (dual-encoder architectures, attention mechanisms) are mature technologies. The proposal to bootstrap with weak supervision from existing metadata and schema matching tools is practical and reduces the need for extensive manual labeling. The evaluation on cross-domain table retrieval tasks is reasonable and implementable. The only moderate challenges might be in creating sufficiently diverse training data across domains and ensuring the attention mechanisms effectively capture the complex structural relationships in tables, but these are manageable issues rather than fundamental barriers."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The significance of this research is substantial. Tables are indeed ubiquitous in data ecosystems as noted in both the proposal and the workshop description, yet they remain underserved in representation learning research. Effective semantic alignment of tables addresses a fundamental challenge in data integration and discovery that has wide-ranging applications. The potential impact spans multiple domains including data cataloging, search, and knowledge discovery across organizational silos. The workshop explicitly mentions data integration and cataloging as important application areas. This research could significantly advance how organizations manage and leverage their tabular data assets, though it may not completely revolutionize the field, which prevents it from receiving the highest possible score."
