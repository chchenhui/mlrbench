    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the TRL workshop's goal of motivating structured data as a primary modality and advancing representation learning for tables. The dual-stream approach specifically tackles the challenge identified in the research idea regarding LLMs struggling with complex table structures. The proposal builds upon existing work mentioned in the literature review (TaBERT, TAPAS, TableFormer, UniTabE, XTab) while addressing their limitations in handling structural metadata. The methodology section thoroughly details how the content and structure streams work together, which is consistent with the dual-stream concept outlined in the idea. The evaluation plan includes benchmarks mentioned in both the idea and literature review (Spider, WikiTableQuestions), making it highly aligned with the expected outcomes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-articulated with a logical structure that flows from introduction to methodology to evaluation. The technical formulations are precise and well-defined, particularly in the model architecture section where mathematical notations clearly explain the content stream, structure stream, and cross-stream interaction mechanisms. The pretraining objectives are explicitly formulated with corresponding loss functions. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) The relationship between the schema graph G and how it's constructed from real-world tables could be more explicitly detailed; (2) The cross-stream alignment objective could be explained more intuitively before diving into the mathematical formulation; (3) Some technical terms (e.g., 'InfoNCE loss') are used without brief explanations. Despite these minor issues, the overall proposal is clear enough for an expert audience to understand and implement."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The dual-stream architecture that explicitly separates content and structure processing is an innovative approach not fully explored in the literature review. While models like TableFormer incorporate structural biases, SADS takes this further by creating dedicated streams with specialized architectures for each aspect. The cross-stream interaction mechanism is particularly novel, allowing bidirectional information flow between content and structure representations. The three pretraining objectives (masked cell recovery, schema relation prediction, and cross-stream alignment) form a comprehensive and original combination that addresses both content understanding and structural awareness. The proposal isn't entirely groundbreaking as it builds upon existing transformer architectures and some pretraining techniques from prior work, but its specific combination of techniques and explicit focus on structure-aware modeling represents a meaningful advancement over the state-of-the-art approaches mentioned in the literature review."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and well-founded in established methods. The transformer architecture for the content stream and graph transformer for the structure stream are based on proven techniques. The mathematical formulations for attention mechanisms, embeddings, and loss functions are technically correct. The pretraining objectives are well-justified and align with the goal of learning both content and structural representations. However, there are some aspects that could be strengthened: (1) The justification for using a graph transformer specifically for the structure stream versus alternatives could be more thoroughly explained; (2) The cross-stream interaction mechanism, while innovative, lacks empirical evidence or theoretical guarantees for its effectiveness; (3) The hyperparameter choices (e.g., L_c=12, L_s=6) are stated without clear justification. Additionally, while the proposal mentions robustness to schema perturbations in the evaluation section, the methodology doesn't explicitly address how the model architecture ensures this robustness. Overall, the approach is technically sound but would benefit from stronger theoretical justifications for some design choices."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction but has some implementation challenges. On the positive side, the data sources are well-identified (WikiTables, Spider, VizNet, TabFact), and the model architecture builds on established transformer components. The training procedure and hyperparameters are clearly specified. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) The computational requirements are substantial - pretraining for 100K steps on 128 A100 GPUs (~1 week) represents a significant resource demand that may be prohibitive for many research groups; (2) Constructing accurate schema graphs G with proper primary/foreign key relationships from diverse table sources could be challenging, especially for tables without explicit metadata; (3) The cross-stream interaction mechanism adds complexity that might lead to training instability or convergence issues; (4) The proposal doesn't address potential data quality issues in the large-scale table corpora. While the research is implementable with sufficient resources, these challenges make it moderately difficult to execute successfully, especially for teams with limited computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap in table representation learning - the explicit modeling of structural information alongside content. This has significant implications for improving performance on important downstream tasks like text-to-SQL, table question answering, and data analysis. The expected outcomes (≥5% improvement on Spider, ≥3% on WikiTableQuestions, 10% better cross-domain generalization) would represent meaningful advances in the field. The dual-stream paradigm could influence future research directions in multimodal learning involving tables with other modalities. The proposal aligns well with the TRL workshop's goals of advancing table representation learning and showcasing impactful applications. The broader contributions section convincingly argues for both immediate benefits (improved NLP systems, BI tools) and long-term impact (extending to multimodal scenarios). The release of pretrained checkpoints and code would democratize access to robust table models, amplifying the research's impact. While not completely transformative of the field, this work would significantly advance the state-of-the-art in structure-aware table representation learning."
