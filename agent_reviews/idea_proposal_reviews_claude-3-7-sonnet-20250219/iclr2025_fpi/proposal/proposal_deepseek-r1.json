    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on 'sampling from generative models weighted by target density' and 'inference-time alignment.' The methodology incorporates diffusion processes and optimal transport concepts mentioned in the workshop topics. The proposal builds upon recent work cited in the literature review, particularly DiffPO, Demon, and SMC-based alignment methods, while proposing innovations in token-level diffusion and reward-aware transition kernels. The mathematical framework is consistent with the diffusion-based sampling approaches described in the literature review, and the experimental design appropriately includes baselines from the cited papers."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The mathematical framework is presented with precise notation and well-defined equations, making the technical approach understandable. The algorithmic steps are concisely outlined, and the experimental design specifies datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for computing reward gradients at the token level could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the noise schedule and the adaptive scheduler could be better explained, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'transition kernel') might benefit from brief explanations for broader accessibility."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements: (1) a token-level diffusion process specifically designed for language models, which differs from the sentence-level approach in DiffPO, (2) a reward-aware transition kernel that incorporates gradients from a reward model, and (3) an adaptive noise scheduling mechanism. While the core concept of using diffusion for inference-time alignment builds upon existing work like DiffPO and Demon (as cited in the literature review), the proposal offers fresh perspectives through its mathematical formulation and implementation approach. The integration of these components into a cohesive framework represents a novel contribution, though it shares conceptual similarities with existing diffusion-based and SMC-based methods."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical rigor in its mathematical framework and algorithmic approach. The formulation of the target distribution, forward process, and reverse process is theoretically sound and builds on established principles from diffusion models and Langevin dynamics. The KL divergence optimization objective for training the transition kernel is well-justified. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics that align with standard practices in the field. However, there are some aspects that could benefit from additional theoretical justification: (1) the convergence properties of the proposed sampling method, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the adaptive noise scheduling, and (3) a more detailed analysis of how the method balances exploration and exploitation during sampling. Overall, the technical foundations are solid with only minor gaps."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with realistic implementation details. The specified hardware requirements (8xA100 GPUs) are reasonable for this type of research, and the use of pretrained LLMs as starting points is practical. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined and implementable with current technology. The proposed number of diffusion steps (T=10) balances efficiency with performance. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) computing gradients of reward models at each step could be computationally expensive, especially for complex rewards, (2) training the transition kernel to effectively balance base model probabilities and reward gradients might require careful tuning, and (3) the adaptive noise scheduling mechanism adds another layer of complexity. While these challenges are manageable, they may require more engineering effort than acknowledged in the proposal."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in AI alignment: enabling efficient, dynamic adaptation of language models without costly retraining. If successful, this research could have substantial impact in several ways: (1) democratizing access to aligned AI by reducing computational requirements, (2) enabling real-time adaptation to changing safety requirements or user preferences, (3) advancing the theoretical understanding of diffusion-based sampling for discrete sequences, and (4) providing a flexible framework that could be extended to other generative models beyond LLMs. The expected outcomes include significant improvements over existing methods (10-15% higher reward scores than SMC-based methods with 30-50% reduced latency compared to fine-tuning), which would represent a meaningful advancement in the field. The potential applications in AI safety and accessibility further enhance its significance."
