    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayesian theory in interactive learning settings, particularly for reinforcement learning with exploration-exploitation trade-offs. The proposal builds upon the cited literature, specifically extending work on PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic and PAC-Bayesian SAC while incorporating time-uniform bounds from Chugg et al. The methodology clearly addresses the challenges identified in the literature review, including sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation balance, and handling nonstationary transitions. The proposal's focus on uncertainty-aware exploration directly implements the core idea presented in the research idea document."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical formulations are precise, with well-defined mathematical notation for the PAC-Bayes bounds, variational posterior optimization, and exploration strategies. The algorithmic steps are presented in a logical sequence, making implementation straightforward. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate benchmarks, baselines, and metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for adapting the time-uniform bounds during training could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the posterior variance and the exploration strategies could be more explicitly connected to the theoretical guarantees, and (3) some of the mathematical notation transitions between sections without explicit redefinition."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by combining several existing concepts in a new way. The integration of PAC-Bayesian bounds with uncertainty-aware exploration strategies (Thompson sampling and UCB) for deep RL is innovative. The adaptation of time-uniform PAC-Bayes bounds to handle non-stationary transitions in RL environments represents a fresh approach. However, the core components build upon existing work: PAC-Bayesian bounds for RL have been explored in PBAC and PAC-Bayesian SAC, and uncertainty-guided exploration is an established concept. The proposal extends rather than fundamentally reimagines these approaches. The novelty lies in the unified framework that explicitly minimizes a PAC-Bayes bound while using posterior uncertainty for exploration, which distinguishes it from prior work that typically uses PAC-Bayes bounds for analysis rather than algorithm design."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. The PAC-Bayesian framework is correctly formulated, with appropriate adaptations for the RL setting. The variational posterior optimization approach is mathematically sound, with proper KL-divergence calculations and reparameterization for gradient estimation. The exploration strategies (Thompson sampling and UCB) are well-justified from a theoretical perspective. The handling of non-stationarity through time-uniform bounds is theoretically grounded in recent literature. The experimental design includes appropriate controls and ablation studies. However, there are some areas that could be strengthened: (1) the variance estimation for the UCB approach might be challenging in practice and deserves more detailed treatment, (2) the theoretical analysis of sample complexity could be more rigorously derived, and (3) the connection between the empirical risk minimization and the true expected return maximization could be more explicitly established."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with some implementation challenges. The core algorithm builds on established techniques in deep RL and variational inference, making the basic implementation straightforward. The experimental design uses standard benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo) with well-defined evaluation metrics. The timeline is reasonable, allocating sufficient time for theoretical development, implementation, and experimentation. However, several practical challenges may arise: (1) computing and maintaining accurate posterior variance estimates over neural network policies could be computationally expensive, (2) balancing the PAC-Bayes bound minimization with reward maximization might require careful hyperparameter tuning, (3) the time-uniform bound adaptation could introduce instability if not carefully implemented, and (4) scaling to high-dimensional problems like Atari might require significant computational resources. These challenges are acknowledged indirectly in the ablation studies but might be more difficult to overcome than suggested."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a significant problem in reinforcement learning: sample efficiency with theoretical guarantees. If successful, this work could substantially impact both theoretical understanding and practical applications of RL. The theoretical contributions would advance PAC-Bayesian theory for interactive settings, potentially establishing new connections between exploration strategies and generalization bounds. The practical impact includes more sample-efficient RL algorithms with uncertainty quantification, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and autonomous systems where data collection is costly. The proposal also bridges theory and practice, addressing a key gap in the field. The expected outcomes include both theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements over state-of-the-art methods. However, the significance is somewhat limited by the focus on standard RL benchmarks rather than more challenging real-world applications, and the potential gap between theoretical guarantees and practical performance in complex domains."
