    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayesian theory in interactive learning settings, particularly reinforcement learning. The proposal incorporates exploration-exploitation trade-offs, PAC-Bayes bounds under distribution shift, and develops a practical algorithm using PAC-Bayesian theory—all explicitly mentioned in the workshop topics. The research builds upon the literature review by extending work on PAC-Bayesian approaches in RL (like PBAC and PAC-Bayesian SAC) while addressing the identified challenges of sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and handling nonstationary environments. The methodology section thoroughly explains how PAC-Bayesian bounds are incorporated into policy optimization with uncertainty-guided exploration, directly fulfilling the research idea's promise."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The introduction effectively establishes the problem and motivation, the methodology section provides detailed mathematical formulations of the PAC-Bayesian bounds and the PBPO algorithm, and the expected outcomes are explicitly stated. The technical formulations are precise and well-presented, with clear definitions of the uncertainty measures and exploration strategies. The experimental design is comprehensive, detailing environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the derived PAC-Bayesian bounds and the actual optimization objective could be more explicitly connected, (2) the mechanism for adapting to non-stationary environments is mentioned but not fully elaborated, and (3) some of the mathematical notation (e.g., the Rényi divergence term) is introduced without sufficient explanation of its practical implementation."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by integrating PAC-Bayesian theory with uncertainty-guided exploration in a comprehensive framework. The approach of using policy disagreement as an uncertainty measure to guide exploration is innovative, as is the extension of PAC-Bayesian bounds to account for distribution shifts in non-stationary environments. The proposal builds upon existing work in PAC-Bayesian RL (as cited in the literature review) but extends it in meaningful ways, particularly in the explicit formulation of uncertainty-guided exploration and the adaptation to non-stationary environments. However, some core components, such as using Gaussian distributions over network weights and KL regularization, are relatively standard in Bayesian RL approaches. The proposal is not entirely groundbreaking but offers fresh perspectives and novel combinations of existing concepts that could advance the field."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. The PAC-Bayesian bounds are properly derived and connected to the reinforcement learning setting, with appropriate consideration of the challenges in this domain. The uncertainty quantification approach is well-justified, and the algorithm design follows logically from the theoretical framework. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate baselines, metrics, and statistical analysis plans. The technical formulations appear correct and are presented with mathematical precision. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional justification: (1) the assumption that a diagonal covariance matrix is sufficient for capturing parameter uncertainty, (2) the specific choice of the uncertainty measure based on policy disagreement rather than alternatives, and (3) the practical implementation of the Rényi divergence term in the bound. Overall, the proposal is sound and rigorous, with only minor gaps in justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with current technology and methods, though it will require significant computational resources and expertise to implement successfully. The algorithmic framework builds on established techniques in deep reinforcement learning and Bayesian neural networks, making implementation practical. The experimental design is realistic, covering a range of environments of varying complexity. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) maintaining and updating distributions over neural network parameters can be computationally expensive, especially for large networks, (2) computing the uncertainty measures during training adds overhead, (3) the adaptation to non-stationary environments may require careful tuning, and (4) the evaluation across diverse environments (from classic control to Atari) is ambitious and time-consuming. Despite these challenges, the approach is generally feasible with appropriate resources and optimization, though the timeline and scope might need adjustment depending on available computational resources."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning—sample efficiency—with potential for significant impact. By providing a theoretically grounded approach to exploration that leverages uncertainty quantification, the research could substantially improve the applicability of RL to real-world problems where data collection is costly. The integration of PAC-Bayesian theory with deep RL bridges an important gap between theory and practice, potentially leading to algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees. The approach to handling non-stationary environments is particularly valuable for practical applications. If successful, the research could influence how exploration is approached in RL and contribute to safer, more efficient learning systems. The expected improvements in sample efficiency (20-30% over state-of-the-art methods) would be meaningful advances. While the impact may be initially concentrated within the RL research community, the potential applications in robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems suggest broader long-term significance."
