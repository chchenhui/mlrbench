    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayesian theory in interactive learning settings, particularly for reinforcement learning with exploration-exploitation trade-offs. The proposal builds upon the cited literature, especially extending work from PBAC and PAC-Bayesian SAC while addressing non-stationary dynamics mentioned in Chugg et al.'s time-uniform bounds. The methodology clearly incorporates uncertainty-aware exploration as outlined in the research idea, and the theoretical foundations are consistent with the PAC-Bayes framework. The only minor inconsistency is that while the task description mentions adversarial corruptions as a potential topic, the proposal doesn't explicitly address this aspect."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and articulated with clear research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The technical formulations are presented with appropriate mathematical notation and explanations. The PAC-Bayes bound derivation, algorithm description, and uncertainty-aware exploration mechanism are all explained in detail. The experimental design section provides specific benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact relationship between the exploration bonus and the PAC-Bayes bound could be more explicitly connected, (2) some technical details about how the time-uniform analysis is incorporated into the algorithm implementation are somewhat abstract, and (3) the transition from theoretical bounds to practical implementation could be elaborated further."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality by combining several innovative elements: (1) adapting time-uniform PAC-Bayes bounds to non-stationary RL environments, (2) developing an uncertainty-aware exploration strategy based on posterior variance, and (3) creating a mechanism to handle distribution shifts via dynamic prior updates. While these individual components build upon existing work (e.g., PBAC, PAC-Bayesian SAC), their integration into a cohesive framework represents a novel contribution. However, the core approach of applying PAC-Bayes to RL has been explored in prior work like PBAC, and the uncertainty-driven exploration shares similarities with existing Bayesian exploration strategies. The proposal would benefit from more explicitly highlighting what specific theoretical or algorithmic advances differentiate it from the cited literature, particularly from PBAC and PAC-Bayesian SAC."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations, building on established PAC-Bayesian theory and extending it to non-stationary RL settings. The mathematical formulations are generally correct and well-presented, with appropriate references to relevant literature. The PAC-Bayes bound derivation leverages time-uniform bounds from Chugg et al., which is suitable for the non-i.i.d. nature of RL data. The variational posterior approach and reparameterization trick are standard techniques in Bayesian deep learning. The uncertainty-aware exploration mechanism is theoretically justified through the posterior variance. The approach to handling non-stationary dynamics through prior updates is well-reasoned. However, there are some areas that could benefit from more rigorous justification: (1) the exact form of the uncertainty score could be more thoroughly derived from first principles, (2) the theoretical guarantees for the annealing schedule of the exploration bonus could be more formally established, and (3) the connection between the empirical loss and the true expected loss in the RL setting could be more precisely defined."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach with implementation details that suggest practical realizability. The neural architecture, objective function, and optimization procedure are all well-defined and can be implemented using standard deep learning frameworks. The experimental design includes specific benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo, RoboSuite) and baselines (SAC, PPO, PBAC) that are standard in the field. However, there are some implementation challenges that may require significant effort: (1) computing the posterior variance over policies for high-dimensional neural networks could be computationally expensive, (2) the periodic prior updates and time-uniform analysis may introduce additional complexity, (3) the hardware validation on a UR5 robotic arm would require substantial resources and expertise, and (4) the expected 2x speedup over SAC/PPO on Atari is ambitious given the computational overhead of maintaining and sampling from a distribution over policies. While these challenges don't render the proposal infeasible, they do suggest that achieving all stated goals may require more resources or time than implied."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning: sample efficiency with theoretical guarantees. If successful, this work would make significant contributions to both theoretical understanding and practical applications of RL. The theoretical contributions include tighter PAC-Bayes bounds for non-stationary environments and formal connections between posterior variance and optimal exploration. The practical impact could be substantial in domains where data collection is costly, such as robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems. The expected outcomes of 2x speedup over SAC/PPO and 30% lower regret in sparse-reward tasks would represent meaningful advances in the field. The potential for improved generalization to out-of-distribution environments (with only 15% performance drop versus >50% for baselines) would be particularly valuable for real-world applications. The proposal aligns well with the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayesian theory for interactive learning and could inspire further research in this direction."
