        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayesian theory in interactive learning settings, specifically reinforcement learning. The proposal builds upon the cited literature, particularly the works by Tasdighi et al. on PAC-Bayesian approaches to RL, and extends them by developing a more comprehensive framework that directly optimizes a PAC-Bayesian objective for policy learning and exploration. The methodology section clearly incorporates the theoretical foundations from the literature review, including adapting PAC-Bayes bounds for non-i.i.d. data as mentioned in Chugg et al.'s work. The proposal also addresses the exploration-exploitation trade-off through uncertainty quantification, which is a key topic mentioned in the workshop scope. The only minor inconsistency is that while the research idea mentioned Atari benchmarks, the proposal primarily focuses on continuous control environments, with Atari mentioned as a potential but challenging extension."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and clearly articulated. The background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes are all presented in a logical flow. The theoretical foundation is explained thoroughly, with clear mathematical formulations of the PAC-Bayesian bounds and how they will be adapted to the RL setting. The algorithmic design section provides detailed pseudocode and explains each component of the proposed PBPO algorithm. The experimental design outlines specific environments, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The exact formulation of the PAC-Bayesian bound for the RL setting is presented as a hypothesis rather than a definitive derivation, with the complexity term \\\\mathcal{C} not fully specified; (2) The integration of the uncertainty-aware exploration with the critic update could be more precisely defined; (3) The handling of non-stationarity in the RL setting is mentioned but the specific adaptations to the PAC-Bayes framework for this challenge could be more detailed."

        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers a novel approach to reinforcement learning by directly optimizing a PAC-Bayesian objective for policy learning and using the resulting posterior for uncertainty-aware exploration. While PAC-Bayesian approaches have been applied to RL before (as seen in the cited works by Tasdighi et al.), this proposal introduces several innovative elements: (1) It focuses on learning a distribution over policies rather than just using PAC-Bayes bounds for critic regularization; (2) It explicitly connects the policy posterior to exploration through Thompson sampling; (3) It integrates the PAC-Bayesian objective directly into the actor update in an actor-critic framework. However, the proposal builds significantly on existing actor-critic methods and PAC-Bayesian RL approaches rather than introducing a completely new paradigm. The Thompson sampling exploration strategy, while well-motivated by the PAC-Bayesian framework, is not entirely novel in RL literature, though its specific integration with the PAC-Bayes objective is innovative."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on solid theoretical foundations from PAC-Bayesian theory and reinforcement learning. The mathematical formulations are mostly correct, and the proposed algorithm follows logically from the theoretical setup. The experimental design is comprehensive, with appropriate benchmarks, baselines, and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The adaptation of PAC-Bayesian bounds to the non-i.i.d., sequential nature of RL data is acknowledged as challenging but not fully resolved in the proposal; (2) The exact form of the complexity term in the PAC-Bayesian bound for RL is left somewhat underspecified; (3) The proposal acknowledges but does not fully address how to handle the changing data distribution as the policy improves during training; (4) The theoretical connection between minimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound and improved sample complexity is stated as an expected outcome but not rigorously established in the proposal. These limitations are acknowledged in the proposal, which suggests they will be addressed during the research."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research direction, but with several significant challenges that could impact implementation success. On the positive side: (1) The algorithmic framework builds on established actor-critic methods, which have proven implementations; (2) The experimental environments and evaluation metrics are standard in RL research; (3) The proposal includes a clear implementation plan with pseudocode. However, several aspects raise feasibility concerns: (1) Deriving and optimizing a tractable PAC-Bayesian bound for the non-i.i.d. nature of RL is acknowledged as challenging and may require significant theoretical innovation; (2) Learning and sampling from a distribution over neural network policies can be computationally expensive, potentially limiting the scalability to complex environments; (3) The proposal mentions adapting to Atari games with sparse rewards, which would require extending the method to discrete action spaces and may introduce additional challenges; (4) The integration of Thompson sampling with deep RL can be unstable due to the high variance in policy sampling; (5) The adaptive tuning of the PAC-Bayes coefficient β is mentioned but not fully specified, and finding the right balance could require extensive hyperparameter tuning."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning: sample efficiency through principled exploration. If successful, this research could have significant impact in several ways: (1) It would provide a theoretically grounded approach to exploration in RL, moving beyond heuristic methods like ε-greedy or entropy maximization; (2) Improved sample efficiency would make RL more viable for real-world applications where data collection is expensive; (3) The explicit quantification of policy uncertainty could enhance safety and reliability in critical applications; (4) The work would strengthen the connection between PAC-Bayesian theory and practical RL algorithms, potentially inspiring further theoretical advances; (5) The approach could be extended to other interactive learning settings beyond RL. The significance is somewhat limited by the focus on standard RL benchmarks rather than novel application domains, and the potential challenges in scaling to very complex environments. Nevertheless, addressing the sample efficiency problem in RL with theoretical guarantees represents an important contribution to the field."
