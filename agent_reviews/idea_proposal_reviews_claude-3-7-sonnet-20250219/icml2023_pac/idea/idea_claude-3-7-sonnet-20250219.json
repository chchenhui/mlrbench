        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayesian theory in interactive learning settings. It specifically addresses non-stationary bandits, which is a core interactive learning problem involving exploration-exploitation trade-offs. The proposal directly tackles 'PAC-Bayes bounds under distribution shift' and 'Development of practically useful interactive learning algorithms using PAC-Bayesian theory,' which are explicitly mentioned topics in the workshop scope. The idea of developing adaptive algorithms with theoretical guarantees for environments with distribution shifts perfectly matches the workshop's interest in sample-efficient learning with probabilistic methods in interactive settings."

        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and structured. It clearly defines the problem (non-stationary bandits), the approach (PAC-Bayesian framework with a novel posterior update mechanism), and the expected outcomes (improved regret bounds). The explanation of how the time-dependent prior evolves based on estimated non-stationarity is particularly clear. However, some technical details about the specific mathematical formulation of the posterior update mechanism and how exactly the algorithm detects distribution shifts could be further elaborated. While the high-level concept is clear, these additional details would make the implementation path more concrete."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates significant novelty in several aspects. The application of PAC-Bayesian theory specifically to non-stationary bandits with a time-dependent prior that evolves based on estimated non-stationarity appears to be a fresh approach. The proposed posterior update mechanism that balances recent observations with uncertainty about distribution change rates is innovative. While PAC-Bayesian methods have been applied to bandits before, the focus on adapting to unknown degrees of non-stationarity without environment-specific knowledge represents a meaningful advancement over existing approaches that typically require manual tuning or prior knowledge about the environment dynamics."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is feasible but presents moderate challenges. The theoretical framework of PAC-Bayesian bounds is well-established, making the derivation of new bounds for non-stationary settings achievable. Implementing the posterior update mechanism and time-dependent prior should be technically possible with current methods. However, there are practical challenges: effectively detecting distribution shifts in real-time can be difficult, especially with limited samples; balancing computational efficiency with theoretical guarantees may require careful algorithm design; and empirical validation across diverse non-stationary environments will be needed to demonstrate the approach's robustness. These challenges are surmountable but will require significant technical work."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses an important problem with broad applications. Non-stationary environments are ubiquitous in real-world applications like recommendation systems, clinical trials, and autonomous systems, making algorithms that can adapt to distribution shifts highly valuable. The theoretical contribution of PAC-Bayesian guarantees that adapt to unknown degrees of non-stationarity would advance our understanding of learning in dynamic environments. If successful, the practical algorithms developed could significantly improve performance in applications where traditional stationary assumptions fail. The work bridges theory and practice in a way that could influence both the theoretical understanding of non-stationary learning problems and the development of more robust interactive learning systems."
