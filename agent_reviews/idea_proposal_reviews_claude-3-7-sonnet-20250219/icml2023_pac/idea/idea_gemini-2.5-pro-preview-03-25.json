        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the workshop's focus on PAC-Bayesian theory in interactive learning settings. It directly addresses active learning, which is explicitly mentioned as part of the workshop's scope. The proposal specifically aims to use PAC-Bayesian bounds to guide exploration in deep active learning, which perfectly matches the workshop's interest in 'development of practically useful interactive learning algorithms using PAC-Bayesian theory' and 'PAC-Bayesian analysis of exploration-exploitation trade-offs.' The idea also connects probabilistic methods with deep learning, another key focus area of the workshop. The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address some other aspects like continual learning or adversarial corruptions mentioned in the workshop scope."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented clearly and concisely. The motivation, main approach, and expected benefits are well-articulated. The proposal clearly explains how PAC-Bayesian bounds will be used to guide the selection of data points in active learning. The implementation approach using MC Dropout or ensembles is specified. However, there are some minor ambiguities: the exact formulation of the PAC-Bayesian bound to be used is not detailed, and the specific mechanism for how the algorithm will 'select points expected to most significantly tighten the bound' could be more precisely defined. Additionally, while image classification is mentioned as an evaluation domain, specific datasets and comparison baselines aren't specified."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty by combining PAC-Bayesian theory with deep active learning in a way that appears to be underexplored. While both PAC-Bayesian theory and active learning are established research areas, using PAC-Bayesian bounds to directly guide the acquisition function in deep active learning represents a fresh approach. The proposal moves beyond heuristic uncertainty sampling toward theoretically grounded sample selection. However, there have been some prior works connecting PAC-Bayes theory to active learning, and the use of probabilistic neural networks (via MC Dropout or ensembles) in active learning is not new in itself. The innovation lies in the specific way these components are integrated to optimize for guaranteed generalization improvement."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea appears quite feasible with current technology and methods. The components required for implementation (PAC-Bayesian bounds, probabilistic neural networks via MC Dropout or ensembles, active learning frameworks) are all well-established. The evaluation on image classification benchmarks is standard practice. However, there are some implementation challenges that might arise: computing PAC-Bayesian bounds efficiently at scale could be computationally intensive, especially if this needs to be done for many candidate points in the unlabeled pool. Additionally, translating theoretical PAC-Bayesian bounds into practical acquisition functions that work well empirically often requires careful design and tuning. The proposal would benefit from more details on how to address these potential computational challenges."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research idea addresses an important problem in machine learning: reducing labeling costs while maintaining strong generalization guarantees. If successful, it could significantly impact both theoretical understanding and practical applications of active learning. The theoretical contribution of connecting PAC-Bayesian bounds directly to active learning acquisition functions would advance our understanding of sample efficiency in interactive learning settings. Practically, more sample-efficient active learning algorithms could reduce annotation costs in many domains where labeling is expensive (medical imaging, autonomous driving, etc.). The significance is enhanced by the fact that the approach aims to provide theoretical guarantees rather than just empirical improvements. However, the current scope is limited to classification tasks, and the broader impact might depend on how well the approach generalizes to other learning paradigms beyond classification."
