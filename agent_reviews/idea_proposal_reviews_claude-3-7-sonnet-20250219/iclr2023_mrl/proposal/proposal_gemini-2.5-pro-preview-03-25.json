        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the MRL workshop's focus on multimodal representation learning, particularly the geometric properties of representations and how training objectives influence them. The proposal builds upon the provided literature, especially drawing from Jiang et al. (2023), Cicchetti et al. (2024), and Tjandrasuwita et al. (2025) to develop explicit geometric alignment methods. The research questions about representation geometry, modality interactions, and training objectives are comprehensively addressed. The only minor limitation is that while the proposal mentions robustness to noise and missing modalities (as highlighted in the task description), this aspect could have been more thoroughly integrated throughout the methodology."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is very well-structured and articulated with clear sections covering background, research problem, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The conceptual framework is explained thoroughly, and the mathematical formulations of the proposed geometric alignment objectives (OT-based and Riemannian geometry-based) are presented with precision. The algorithmic steps and experimental design are detailed and logical. The only areas that could benefit from slight refinement are: (1) some mathematical notations could be more consistently defined (e.g., the relationship between modalities M_i and specific instances like X and Y), and (2) the distinction between the different geometric alignment approaches could be more explicitly compared in terms of their theoretical advantages and limitations."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal offers notable originality by focusing on explicit geometric alignment between modality manifolds, which goes beyond the standard instance-level alignment in contrastive learning. The integration of Optimal Transport and Riemannian geometry principles into multimodal representation learning is innovative. However, some aspects of the approach build upon existing work: the use of OT for distribution alignment has precedents in machine learning (though not specifically for multimodal manifold alignment), and the concept of geometric alignment draws from papers like Cicchetti et al. (2024) with GRAM. The proposal acknowledges these connections while offering fresh perspectives on how to implement and evaluate geometric alignment, particularly through the combination of different alignment objectives and comprehensive geometric analysis."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is technically sound and demonstrates strong theoretical foundations. The mathematical formulations of the OT-based and Riemannian geometry-based alignment objectives are well-defined and justified. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies to validate the approach. The geometric analysis methods (Wasserstein distance, neighborhood overlap, Procrustes analysis) are well-chosen to quantify alignment. The only minor limitations are: (1) the computational complexity of some proposed methods (particularly OT with Sinkhorn) could be more thoroughly addressed, as these might present challenges for large-scale training, and (2) some assumptions about the manifold structure of embeddings could benefit from more theoretical justification."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is largely feasible with existing technology and methods, though it will require careful implementation and optimization. The datasets mentioned (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, VGGSound, ActivityNet) are standard and accessible. The algorithmic steps are clearly defined and implementable. However, there are some practical challenges: (1) computing OT distances and solving for transport plans in each training iteration could be computationally expensive, potentially requiring GPU optimization or approximations; (2) the neighborhood-based alignment might face scalability issues with large batch sizes; (3) the proposal mentions potentially using pre-trained encoders, which is practical, but fine-tuning these large models requires substantial computational resources. The research team would need to address these implementation challenges, but none appear insurmountable with appropriate resources and optimization strategies."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses an important problem in multimodal representation learning with clear potential impact. If successful, the explicit geometric alignment methods could significantly improve the quality of multimodal representations, leading to better performance on downstream tasks and more robust models. The research directly contributes to fundamental questions posed by the MRL workshop about representation properties, modality interactions, and training objectives. The findings could influence how future multimodal models are designed and trained. The significance is enhanced by the comprehensive evaluation plan that includes both task performance and geometric analysis, providing insights beyond just empirical improvements. The only limitation is that while the proposal focuses on image-text and audio-video pairs, the generalization to more complex multimodal scenarios with three or more modalities is less developed."
