    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns exceptionally well with the task description, particularly addressing the workshop's focus on multimodal representation learning. It directly tackles one of the explicit questions listed in the task: 'How can we quantify the (dis)similarity between modalities?' The proposal also addresses other key topics from the workshop, including robustness to missing modalities and noise, modality interactions, and the semantic contribution of different modalities. The adaptive fusion mechanism speaks to the workshop's interest in understanding how different modalities contribute to representation quality. The only minor gap is that it doesn't extensively discuss the geometry of representation spaces beyond mentioning cosine similarity and optimal transport distances."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is presented with strong clarity, outlining a coherent three-step approach: (1) modality-specific encoders learning to align with a shared space, (2) a discrepancy score to measure modality agreement, and (3) a dynamic fusion mechanism. The motivation and problem statement are well-articulated, and the evaluation strategy is clearly defined. The concept of the 'discrepancy score' is central to the proposal and is explained sufficiently, though some technical details about how it would be implemented and regularized could be more specific. The theoretical guarantees mentioned (e.g., triangle inequality) could benefit from more elaboration on why they matter for this application. Overall, the idea is well-structured and comprehensible with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good novelty in its approach to quantifying modality dissimilarity and using this metric to guide adaptive fusion. While contrastive learning for multimodal representation is not new, the specific focus on measuring disagreement between modalities and using this to dynamically adjust fusion weights appears to be a fresh perspective. The introduction of a regularized 'discrepancy score' with theoretical guarantees is an innovative element. However, aspects of the approach build upon existing work in contrastive multimodal learning and adaptive fusion mechanisms. The theoretical analysis linking discrepancy scores to downstream performance is a valuable contribution, but the overall framework combines existing techniques in a novel way rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea appears highly feasible with current technology and methods. The components of the approach—contrastive learning, representation alignment, and adaptive fusion—are all established techniques with known implementations. The proposal to evaluate on multimodal benchmarks with missing modalities and adversarial noise is practical and well-defined. Computing similarity metrics like cosine similarity or optimal transport distances is straightforward with existing tools. The regularization of the discrepancy score might require careful design but is implementable. The theoretical analysis linking scores to performance may be challenging but is achievable with proper mathematical formulation. The main implementation challenge would likely be in designing an effective dynamic fusion mechanism that can adjust weights in real-time without introducing instability, but this is manageable with current methods."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a fundamental challenge in multimodal learning with significant potential impact. The ability to quantify modality dissimilarity and adaptively fuse information could substantially improve robustness in real-world applications where modalities may be missing, noisy, or misaligned. The theoretical contributions linking discrepancy scores to performance could provide valuable insights for the field beyond this specific implementation. The approach has clear applications in critical domains like medical imaging and autonomous driving, where modality reliability varies. By enabling models to dynamically prioritize informative modalities, this work could lead to more efficient and reliable multimodal systems. The significance is somewhat limited by the fact that it addresses a specific aspect of multimodal learning rather than revolutionizing the entire field, but within its scope, it addresses an important problem with broad implications."
