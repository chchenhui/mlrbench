        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task description's focus on interactive finetuning and language gamification. It specifically addresses the Deep Reinforcement Learning topic mentioned in the workshop, using language games to foster planning and reasoning abilities in LLMs. The adversarial setup between Planner and Skeptic creates the interactive training loop emphasized in the task description. The proposal recognizes the limitations of current LLM training paradigms (static datasets, lack of interaction) which the workshop aims to address. However, it doesn't explicitly connect to some other workshop topics like cognitive science perspectives or embodiment, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated with a clear structure: motivation, main idea, and expected outcomes. The roles of the two agents (Planner and Skeptic) are defined, and the basic mechanics of the game are explained. However, several important details remain ambiguous: the specific reward structure, how the Skeptic is incentivized to find flaws, the exact evaluation criteria for successful persuasion, and the technical implementation of the RL framework. The proposal would benefit from more precise definitions of what constitutes successful planning and how the interactive dialogue is structured and evaluated."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea combines several existing concepts (adversarial training, language games, reinforcement learning for LLMs) in a fresh way. The persuasion game format with distinct Planner and Skeptic roles offers an innovative approach to improving planning capabilities. While adversarial training and RL for LLMs are not new, the specific application to planning via persuasion represents a novel angle. However, similar multi-agent debate frameworks have been explored in recent research, and the core concept builds upon established self-play techniques rather than introducing a fundamentally new paradigm. The novelty lies more in the specific application and framing rather than in creating an entirely new methodology."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is implementable with current technology but faces several practical challenges. Training LLMs with RL is computationally expensive and often unstable. Designing appropriate reward functions for persuasion quality is non-trivial, as is creating objective evaluation metrics for planning success. The proposal doesn't address how to prevent the agents from developing degenerate strategies (e.g., the Skeptic becoming too easily convinced). Additionally, ensuring that improvements in the game environment transfer to real-world planning scenarios requires careful experimental design. While these challenges don't make the research impossible, they do require significant technical expertise and resources to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "Improving planning and reasoning capabilities in LLMs addresses a significant limitation in current models and has wide-ranging applications. The interactive approach could potentially lead to more robust and grounded reasoning than current methods. If successful, this research could influence how future LLMs are trained, moving beyond static datasets toward more dynamic, interactive paradigms. The approach also contributes to the broader theoretical understanding of how adversarial interaction shapes language capabilities. The significance is high because planning is a fundamental cognitive skill with applications across numerous domains, from robotics to decision support systems, though the proposal could more explicitly connect to real-world impact scenarios."
