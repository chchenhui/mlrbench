    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal aligns exceptionally well with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on Language Gamification by proposing an adversarial 'Persuasion Game' that enables interactive LLM finetuning. The methodology incorporates deep reinforcement learning in a multi-agent setting, which matches the research idea of using DRL within an adversarial language game framework. The proposal cites and builds upon the literature review papers, particularly leveraging concepts from Son et al. (2025), Shi et al. (2024), and Johnson & Brown (2023). The theoretical foundations draw appropriately from Wittgenstein's language games concept mentioned in the task description. The only minor inconsistency is that some cited papers in the proposal (e.g., Steels, 2012) aren't in the provided literature review, but this doesn't significantly impact the overall alignment."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated. The research objectives are explicitly stated, and the methodology is presented in a logical sequence with appropriate technical details. The task formulation, model architecture, RL objective, reward design, and algorithmic steps are all well-defined with mathematical formulations that enhance precision. The experimental design section comprehensively outlines datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, and ablation studies. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarification: (1) the exact mechanism for co-training the Skeptic could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the persuasion reward and the external validation of plan correctness needs more explanation, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'Generalized Advantage Estimation') are mentioned without sufficient context for readers unfamiliar with RL terminology."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to enhancing LLM planning capabilities through adversarial language games. While the individual components (RL for LLMs, adversarial training, multi-agent systems) exist in prior work, their combination into a 'Persuasion Game' specifically designed to improve multi-step planning represents a fresh perspective. The framing of planning as a social, interactive process requiring justification and defense against a skeptical agent is innovative. The proposal extends beyond existing work by: (1) introducing a specific adversarial dialogue structure for planning tasks, (2) developing a reward mechanism that balances persuasiveness with logical coherence, and (3) exploring both fixed and co-trained Skeptic models. The concept of 'language gamification' as a third paradigm alongside supervised learning and RLHF is forward-thinking. However, the approach does share similarities with adversarial training methods in the literature review, which slightly reduces its novelty score."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates solid theoretical foundations and methodological rigor. The RL formulation is technically sound, with appropriate mathematical notation for the policy gradient approach and advantage estimation. The reward design thoughtfully combines multiple components (persuasion, coherence, efficiency) to guide learning. The experimental design includes relevant baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where the technical soundness could be improved: (1) the proposal doesn't fully address potential instabilities in adversarial training of language models, (2) there's limited discussion of how to ensure the Skeptic provides meaningful challenges rather than arbitrary objections, (3) the coherence reward relies on 'a reference proof' without specifying how this would be obtained for diverse planning tasks, and (4) the proposal doesn't thoroughly address potential reward hacking behaviors that might emerge in the adversarial setting. These gaps, while not fatal flaws, somewhat reduce the overall soundness of the approach."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a challenging but potentially implementable research agenda. On the positive side: (1) the authors acknowledge computational costs and propose transfer learning from lightweight environments as a mitigation strategy, (2) the algorithmic steps are clearly defined, and (3) the experimental design includes realistic datasets and evaluation metrics. However, several feasibility concerns arise: (1) training two LLMs in an adversarial setting with RL is computationally expensive and potentially unstable, (2) designing effective reward functions for the Skeptic that maintain appropriate adversarial pressure without being too harsh or too lenient is non-trivial, (3) the proposal mentions 'human-in-the-loop audits' but doesn't detail how these would be implemented at scale, and (4) the evaluation metrics like 'Logical Consistency Score' would require sophisticated external verifiers that may be difficult to implement for complex planning domains. While the research direction is promising, these implementation challenges make it a moderately feasible proposal rather than a highly feasible one."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical limitation in current LLMs—their ability to plan coherently over multiple steps and justify decisions—which has significant implications for AI applications requiring complex reasoning. If successful, this research could: (1) establish a new paradigm for interactive finetuning that complements existing methods, (2) substantially improve LLM performance in planning-intensive domains like robotics, tutoring, and strategic decision support, (3) provide insights into the relationship between adversarial dialogue and reasoning skill development, and (4) bridge cognitive science theories with large-scale neural models. The anticipated improvements (10-20% in planning success rates, 15-30% reduction in dialogue length) would represent meaningful advances. The broader impact extends beyond the specific implementation to influence how we conceptualize and train language models. The proposal also acknowledges potential risks and offers mitigation strategies, demonstrating awareness of the research's broader implications."
