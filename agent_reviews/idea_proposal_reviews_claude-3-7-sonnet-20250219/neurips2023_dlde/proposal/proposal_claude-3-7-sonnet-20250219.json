    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the symbiosis between deep learning and differential equations by proposing Diffusion-Guided Neural Operators (DGNOs) that leverage diffusion models for solving high-dimensional PDEs. The proposal thoroughly incorporates the core concept from the research idea of treating PDE solutions as a denoising process with physics-informed constraints. It builds upon the literature review by addressing the identified challenges (curse of dimensionality, scalability, training efficiency) and extends previous work on physics-informed diffusion models and neural operators. The proposal also maintains consistency with the workshop's focus on bidirectional exchange between classical mathematical modeling and modern deep learning, showing how diffusion models (rooted in SDEs) can enhance PDE solvers while PDE constraints can guide diffusion processes."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The mathematical formulations are precise and well-defined, with appropriate notation and clear explanations of the key components (forward diffusion process, reverse process, neural architecture, training procedure). The objectives are explicitly stated and the experimental design is thoroughly described. The proposal effectively communicates complex concepts at the intersection of diffusion models and PDE solving. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the relationship between the modified diffusion process and traditional PDE discretization methods could be more explicitly compared, (2) some technical details about the implementation of differential operators in high dimensions could be further elaborated, and (3) the transition between theoretical formulation and practical implementation could be smoother in some sections."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a highly innovative approach by integrating diffusion models with neural operators specifically for high-dimensional PDE solving. While both diffusion models and neural operators exist separately, their combination in the proposed DGNO framework represents a novel contribution. The key innovations include: (1) the modified forward diffusion process that incorporates PDE operators to guide the noise addition, (2) the hybrid loss function balancing generative modeling with physics constraints, (3) the curriculum learning strategy for physics-informed losses, and (4) the progressive dimensionality training approach. The proposal extends beyond existing work in the literature review by providing a comprehensive mathematical framework that unifies these approaches and specifically targets extremely high-dimensional problems (100+ dimensions). However, some components like the use of physics-informed loss terms and neural operators for PDEs build upon existing techniques, which slightly reduces the novelty score."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and rigorous methodology. The mathematical formulation of the diffusion process modified to incorporate PDE operators is well-grounded in both stochastic calculus and differential equation theory. The neural network architecture is carefully designed with appropriate components (positional encoding, parameter conditioning, time embedding) that address the specific challenges of the task. The training procedure with its hybrid loss function is theoretically sound, balancing the generative aspects with physical constraints. The experimental design is comprehensive, covering a range of PDE types and dimensions with appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. The proposal also acknowledges potential challenges and includes strategies to address them, such as curriculum learning and progressive dimensionality training. The technical formulations are correct and clearly presented, with proper mathematical notation and justification for design choices."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible approach with some implementation challenges. On the positive side: (1) The methodology builds on established techniques in both diffusion models and neural operators, which have proven successful in their respective domains; (2) The training procedure is well-defined with clear loss functions and optimization strategies; (3) The experimental design includes progressively complex problems, allowing for incremental validation. However, several feasibility concerns exist: (1) Scaling to extremely high dimensions (500D) as proposed may require substantial computational resources beyond what's typically available; (2) The implementation of differential operators in such high dimensions could face numerical stability issues; (3) The training time for diffusion models is already known to be lengthy, and adding PDE constraints may further increase computational demands; (4) The proposal doesn't fully address how to efficiently compute the PDE residuals in very high dimensions during training. While the approach is theoretically sound and likely implementable for moderate dimensions, the extreme high-dimensional cases may prove challenging without specialized hardware or further algorithmic optimizations."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in computational science - the curse of dimensionality in PDE solving - with potential for transformative impact across multiple domains. If successful, this research would: (1) Enable accurate solutions to previously intractable high-dimensional PDEs, opening new possibilities in quantum mechanics, financial mathematics, and fluid dynamics; (2) Establish a new paradigm for neural PDE solvers that leverages the strengths of generative models; (3) Provide practical tools for scientists and engineers working with complex systems; (4) Bridge the gap between traditional numerical methods and modern deep learning approaches. The applications highlighted in the proposal (multi-asset option pricing, turbulent flows) represent significant real-world problems where improved solutions would have immediate value. The theoretical contributions would also advance our understanding of the connections between stochastic processes and deterministic PDEs. The comprehensive software implementation promised would further enhance the impact by making these advanced methods accessible to researchers across disciplines."
