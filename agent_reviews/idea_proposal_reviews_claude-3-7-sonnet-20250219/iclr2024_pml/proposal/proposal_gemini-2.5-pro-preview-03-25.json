    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the workshop's focus on privacy regulation and protection in machine learning, specifically targeting the relationship between privacy regulations (GDPR) and machine learning, efficient methods for privacy-preserving ML, federated learning for data minimization, and differential privacy theory and practice. The proposal faithfully implements the core ideas from the research idea, including the automatic tagging of features by regulatory sensitivity, dynamic allocation of privacy budgets, secure aggregation with tailored budgets, and immutable audit logs. It also builds upon the literature review by addressing key challenges identified, such as balancing privacy and utility (Li et al., 2024), handling data heterogeneity (Banse et al., 2024), and implementing adaptive privacy budget allocation (Kiani et al., 2025). The proposal cites relevant papers from the literature review and incorporates their findings and approaches."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and generally clear in its presentation. The introduction effectively establishes the background, problem statement, proposed solution, research objectives, and significance. The methodology section provides detailed algorithmic steps, including mathematical formulations for the feature sensitivity tagging, dynamic privacy budget allocation, differentially private federated aggregation, and audit log generation. The experimental design and evaluation metrics are well-defined. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification: (1) The exact mechanism for integrating the sensitivity tagging with secure aggregation could be more precisely defined, (2) The relationship between feature-level clipping and the dynamic budget allocation could be more explicitly formulated, and (3) Some technical details about the composition of privacy guarantees across features could be elaborated. Overall, the proposal is highly understandable with only minor ambiguities."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a novel approach to differential privacy in federated learning by introducing regulation-sensitive dynamic allocation of privacy budgets. While differential privacy and federated learning are established concepts, the integration of regulatory sensitivity classifications into the privacy mechanism represents a fresh perspective. The automated sensitivity tagging module and the dynamic budget allocation algorithm are innovative contributions. The proposal distinguishes itself from prior work like Kiani et al. (2025), which focuses on time-adaptive privacy budgets but not feature-specific allocation based on regulatory sensitivity. The immutable audit log for compliance verification is another novel aspect. The proposal doesn't claim to introduce fundamentally new privacy mechanisms but rather presents a new way to apply and adapt existing techniques to better align with regulatory requirements, which is a valuable innovation. The approach bridges technical and regulatory domains in a way that hasn't been extensively explored in the literature."

    "Soundness": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal is generally sound and built on established theoretical foundations of differential privacy and federated learning. The mathematical formulations for budget allocation and noise injection follow valid DP principles. The experimental design includes appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics. However, there are some areas where the technical rigor could be strengthened: (1) The proposal doesn't fully address how the feature-level DP composition affects the overall privacy guarantees - while it mentions using appropriate composition theorems, the specific approach isn't detailed; (2) The automated sensitivity tagging module relies on relatively simple techniques (metadata analysis, keyword matching) which may not be robust enough for complex real-world data schemas; (3) The proposal assumes that features can be cleanly separated for differential privacy purposes, which may not hold for all models (especially deep neural networks where features interact in complex ways). Despite these limitations, the overall approach is technically sound and the proposed methods are well-justified."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a feasible research plan with clearly defined steps. The use of publicly available datasets (or synthetic alternatives) for healthcare and financial domains is practical. The algorithmic components build upon established techniques in federated learning and differential privacy, making implementation realistic. The evaluation methodology is comprehensive and achievable. However, there are some implementation challenges that may affect feasibility: (1) The automated sensitivity tagging module may require significant domain expertise to create effective rules for different regulatory contexts; (2) Implementing feature-level differential privacy in complex neural network architectures could be technically challenging; (3) The secure aggregation protocol with feature-specific noise injection adds complexity that might increase computational and communication overhead; (4) The immutable audit log system, especially if implementing blockchain-like features, adds another layer of implementation complexity. While these challenges are significant, they don't render the proposal infeasible - rather, they represent areas where careful implementation and potential scope adjustments might be needed."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical gap between technical privacy mechanisms and regulatory requirements, which is highly significant for both research and practical applications. By aligning differential privacy with regulatory sensitivity classifications, it could substantially improve the utility-privacy trade-off in federated learning systems while maintaining or enhancing compliance with regulations like GDPR. This has important implications for sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where both privacy protection and model utility are crucial. The audit log component directly addresses the accountability requirements of modern privacy regulations, potentially simplifying compliance verification. The approach could make privacy-preserving federated learning more practical and attractive for real-world deployments, accelerating adoption in regulated industries. The interdisciplinary nature of the work, bridging technical ML research with regulatory frameworks, aligns perfectly with the workshop's goals and represents a valuable contribution to the field. The potential 30% utility gain while maintaining privacy compliance would be a substantial improvement over current approaches."
