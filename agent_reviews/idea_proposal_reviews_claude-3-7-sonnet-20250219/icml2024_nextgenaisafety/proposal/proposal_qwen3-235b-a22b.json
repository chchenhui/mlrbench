    "Consistency": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates excellent alignment with the task description, research idea, and literature review. It directly addresses the 'Dangerous Capabilities' focus area mentioned in the task description by developing a system to prevent AI from enabling harm while preserving beneficial knowledge access. The two-stage Risk-Adaptive Filter approach faithfully implements the core concept outlined in the research idea, including the risk classifier, dynamic policy enforcement, and safe-completion templates. The methodology incorporates techniques from the literature review, such as Safe RLHF's decoupling of helpfulness and harmlessness, RA-PbRL's risk-aware objectives, and Iterated CVaR for robust risk measures. The only minor inconsistency is that while the literature review mentions transparency as a key challenge, the proposal could have more explicitly addressed how the system would be transparent and interpretable to users and oversight bodies."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a logical flow from introduction to methodology to expected outcomes. The research objectives are explicitly stated and broken down into three core requirements. The methodology section provides detailed explanations of both stages of the Risk-Adaptive Filter, including specific mathematical formulations for the risk classifier and reward functions. The evaluation design is comprehensive, with clearly defined benchmark datasets and metrics. Tables and mathematical equations enhance understanding of complex concepts. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional clarity: (1) the exact mechanism for updating policies against emerging threats could be more detailed, (2) the relationship between the risk score thresholds and the action space could be more explicitly defined, and (3) some technical terms (e.g., 'BERTScore') are used without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with these concepts."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates notable originality in several aspects. The two-stage Risk-Adaptive Filter represents a novel approach to dangerous capability filtering by combining neural risk classification with reinforcement learning for dynamic policy enforcement. The integration of adversarial dataset augmentation specifically tailored to dangerous capability queries is innovative. The proposal also introduces new benchmark datasets (DANGER-500K and REDTEAM-30K) that could become standards in the field. However, many of the individual components build directly on existing techniques (DeBERTa, PPO, RLHF, CVaR) rather than introducing fundamentally new methods. The approach is more of a thoughtful synthesis and application of existing techniques to a specific problem domain rather than a groundbreaking new paradigm. The threshold adaptation algorithm is presented as a theoretical contribution, but its novelty compared to existing risk-aware RL frameworks is not strongly differentiated."
    },
    "Soundness": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal demonstrates strong technical foundations and rigor. The methodology is well-grounded in established machine learning techniques, with appropriate mathematical formulations for the risk classifier, reward functions, and policy optimization. The use of focal loss to address class imbalance and the incorporation of risk measures like CVaR show technical sophistication. The evaluation design is comprehensive, with multiple benchmark datasets and both quantitative and qualitative metrics. The ablation studies are well-designed to isolate the contributions of different components. However, there are some areas where additional rigor would strengthen the proposal: (1) the justification for choosing DeBERTa-v3-large over other architectures is not provided, (2) the sample complexity and computational requirements for training the system are not thoroughly analyzed, and (3) while the proposal mentions addressing false positives, the specific techniques to minimize overblocking of legitimate queries could be more rigorously defined. Overall, the technical approach is sound, but some theoretical justifications could be strengthened."

    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The proposal presents a largely feasible approach using existing technologies and methods. The two-stage architecture is implementable with current machine learning frameworks, and the data collection strategy leverages existing datasets supplemented with synthetic generation. The evaluation methodology is practical and well-defined. However, several implementation challenges exist: (1) Curating a comprehensive taxonomy of dangerous capabilities across eight domains would require significant expert resources and time; (2) Obtaining 100 experts across biosecurity and cybersecurity for feedback signals may be difficult and expensive; (3) The requirement for response latency (<300ms at 95th percentile) with a 1.5B parameter model presents computational challenges in production environments; (4) The human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning framework would require substantial infrastructure for collecting and processing human feedback at scale. While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they do represent significant practical hurdles that would require considerable resources and expertise to overcome."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The proposal addresses a critical problem in AI safety with substantial potential impact. Successfully implementing a dynamic risk-adaptive filter could significantly reduce the misuse potential of AI systems while preserving their utility for legitimate research and applications. The expected technical advancements (94% AUC-ROC, reduction of dangerous completions from 18% to 4%) would represent meaningful improvements over current safety mechanisms. The creation and release of benchmark datasets would benefit the broader research community. The societal impact is well-articulated, particularly in supporting regulatory frameworks and enabling cautious exploration of safety-critical domains. The proposal also considers equity considerations by addressing overblocking in non-English languages. However, the significance is somewhat limited by focusing primarily on text-based queries rather than addressing multimodal dangerous capabilities (e.g., images, code), which are increasingly important. Additionally, while the proposal mentions policy enablement, it could more explicitly address how the system would adapt to evolving regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions."
