        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns well with the task's focus on AI safety, particularly addressing the 'Agentic AI' trend mentioned in the task description. The proposal directly tackles the concern of ensuring autonomous agents respect safety protocols and ethical boundaries. It also touches on the need for human oversight, which aligns with the task's emphasis on trustworthiness standards. However, while the idea strongly addresses agentic AI safety, it doesn't explicitly address the other four emerging trends mentioned in the task (multimodal, personalized interactions, sensitive applications, and dangerous capabilities), which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The research idea is generally well-articulated and understandable. It clearly explains the core concept of a dual optimization framework that balances reward maximization with constraint satisfaction. The introduction of 'ethical boundary models' and the hierarchical safety architecture are defined adequately. However, there are some ambiguities that prevent a higher score. For instance, the proposal doesn't specify how exactly the ethical boundary models would identify potential safety violations, what constitutes an 'ethical principle' in the hierarchical architecture, or how the interpretable safety modules would function in practice. These aspects would benefit from further elaboration to make the idea fully clear."

    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates notable originality by proposing a dynamic approach to safety constraints that evolve alongside agent capabilities. The concept of 'ethical boundary models' that adapt to new potential risks represents a fresh perspective on safety in reinforcement learning. The hierarchical safety architecture with interpretable modules is also innovative. However, the core concept of combining reward maximization with constraint satisfaction in RL is not entirely new, as constrained RL and safe RL are established research areas. The proposal builds upon existing approaches rather than introducing a completely groundbreaking paradigm, which is why it receives a good but not excellent novelty score."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is somewhat feasible but faces significant implementation challenges. Creating dynamic ethical boundary models that can anticipate and adapt to new risks is technically complex and may require sophisticated modeling of ethical principles that are difficult to formalize. The hierarchical safety architecture is implementable in principle, but ensuring that high-level ethical principles effectively constrain lower-level decisions across diverse scenarios is challenging. The interpretable safety modules add another layer of complexity. While the individual components have precedents in existing research, integrating them into a cohesive system that works reliably in open-ended environments would require considerable resources, expertise, and time. The proposal is feasible but with substantial implementation hurdles."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea addresses a critical problem in AI safety that will only grow more important as autonomous systems become more powerful and widespread. Successfully implementing a framework that enables autonomous agents to balance goal achievement with safety constraints would be a major advancement in the field. The potential impact extends beyond academic interest to practical applications across numerous domains where AI agents operate. The focus on interpretability and human oversight further enhances its significance by addressing the crucial need for transparency in safety-critical AI systems. If successful, this research could substantially contribute to ensuring that increasingly autonomous AI systems remain aligned with human values and safety requirements."
