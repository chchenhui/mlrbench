        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The research idea aligns excellently with the task description, specifically addressing the 'Agentic AI' trend mentioned in the task. It directly tackles the concern of ensuring autonomous AI agents 'respect privacy and adhere to safety protocols' by proposing a proactive harm recognition system embedded within the agent's decision-making process. The idea is highly relevant to the AI safety challenges outlined in the task, focusing on preventing unintended consequences and ethical issues before they occur, rather than relying on post-hoc solutions."

    "Clarity": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "The research idea is well-articulated and easy to understand. It clearly defines the problem (safety in autonomous AI agents), proposes a specific solution (Harm Potential Predictor module), and explains how this would be implemented (integrated into planning/policy networks, trained with RL, using harm scores as negative rewards). The technical approach is described with sufficient detail to understand the implementation strategy. Minor ambiguities exist around the exact nature of the 'multi-dimensional harm score' and how the training data of potential harms would be comprehensively developed, but these are reasonable areas for further exploration within the research."
    },
    "Novelty": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The idea demonstrates good originality by proposing to embed safety constraints directly into the decision-making process rather than applying them as external rules or post-hoc checks. The concept of a 'Harm Potential Predictor' that forecasts potential negative outcomes of actions before they're taken represents a fresh approach to AI safety. However, the core techniques mentioned (reinforcement learning with negative rewards, constraint-based optimization) build upon existing approaches in AI safety research. The innovation lies in the integration method and application context rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or frameworks."
    },
    "Feasibility": {
        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The research idea is moderately feasible but faces several implementation challenges. Creating comprehensive training datasets that cover the vast space of potential harms across different contexts would be difficult. The approach requires simulating harmful scenarios for training without actually causing harm, which presents ethical and practical challenges. Additionally, defining and quantifying 'harm' in a multi-dimensional space that generalizes across contexts is non-trivial. The technical components (RL, integration with planning systems) are established, but the specific application to harm prediction at scale would require significant research and development. The idea is implementable but would require considerable resources and careful experimental design."

    "Significance": {
        "score": 8,
        "justification": "This research addresses a critical problem in AI safety that will only grow more important as AI systems become more autonomous. Successfully implementing proactive harm recognition could significantly reduce risks associated with agentic AI systems and potentially establish a new paradigm for building safety into AI architectures. The impact would extend beyond academic interest to practical applications in various high-stakes domains where autonomous AI might be deployed. The approach could also generalize to other safety concerns beyond the specific harms mentioned. The significance is high because it tackles a fundamental challenge in ensuring AI systems remain beneficial and safe as they gain greater autonomy."
